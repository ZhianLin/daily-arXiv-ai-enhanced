### [1] [MultiFoodhat: A potential new paradigm for intelligent food quality inspection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13889)
*Yue Hu,Guohang Zhuang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MultiFoodChat是一个基于对话的多智能体推理框架，用于零样本食物识别，通过整合视觉语言模型和大语言模型实现协作推理，无需额外训练或标注即可识别未见过的食物类别。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有监督模型依赖大量标注数据且对未见食物类别泛化能力有限，需要开发无需标注的零样本识别方法。

Method: 结合视觉语言模型和大型语言模型，通过多轮视觉-文本对话进行协作推理，使用对象感知令牌捕获细粒度视觉属性，交互式推理代理动态解释上下文线索。

Result: 在多个公共食物数据集上的实验表明，MultiFoodChat相比现有无监督和少样本方法具有更高的识别准确性和可解释性。

Conclusion: MultiFoodChat展示了作为智能食品质量检测和分析新范式的潜力，能够灵活理解复杂食物场景。

Abstract: Food image classification plays a vital role in intelligent food quality
inspection, dietary assessment, and automated monitoring. However, most
existing supervised models rely heavily on large labeled datasets and exhibit
limited generalization to unseen food categories. To overcome these challenges,
this study introduces MultiFoodChat, a dialogue-driven multi-agent reasoning
framework for zero-shot food recognition. The framework integrates
vision-language models (VLMs) and large language models (LLMs) to enable
collaborative reasoning through multi-round visual-textual dialogues. An Object
Perception Token (OPT) captures fine-grained visual attributes, while an
Interactive Reasoning Agent (IRA) dynamically interprets contextual cues to
refine predictions. This multi-agent design allows flexible and human-like
understanding of complex food scenes without additional training or manual
annotations. Experiments on multiple public food datasets demonstrate that
MultiFoodChat achieves superior recognition accuracy and interpretability
compared with existing unsupervised and few-shot methods, highlighting its
potential as a new paradigm for intelligent food quality inspection and
analysis.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 开发了一个用于分割深色子宫内膜异位症植入物的系统，能够分析腹腔镜手术视频并标注检测区域


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 子宫内膜异位症具有多种视觉表现且位置多样，识别困难且容易出错，需要为妇科医生提供辅助诊断工具

Method: 训练系统识别深色子宫内膜异位症植入物，分析腹腔镜手术视频，使用多色覆盖层标注识别区域，并提供检测摘要

Result: 系统能够成功识别和分割深色子宫内膜异位症植入物，为视频浏览提供改进的检测摘要

Conclusion: 该系统为妇科医生治疗子宫内膜异位症提供了有效的辅助工具，能够提高诊断准确性和视频分析效率

Abstract: Endometriosis is a common women's condition exhibiting a manifold visual
appearance in various body-internal locations. Having such properties makes its
identification very difficult and error-prone, at least for laymen and
non-specialized medical practitioners. In an attempt to provide assistance to
gynecologic physicians treating endometriosis, this demo paper describes a
system that is trained to segment one frequently occurring visual appearance of
endometriosis, namely dark endometrial implants. The system is capable of
analyzing laparoscopic surgery videos, annotating identified implant regions
with multi-colored overlays and displaying a detection summary for improved
video browsing.

### [3] [Efficient Few-Shot Learning in Remote Sensing: Fusing Vision and Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13993)
*Jia Yun Chua,Argyrios Zolotas,Miguel Arana-Catania*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究将传统视觉模型（YOLO）与视觉语言模型（LLaVA、ChatGPT、Gemini）结合，用于遥感图像分析，特别是在飞机检测和场景理解任务中，在标记和未标记数据以及图像退化场景下取得了显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统视觉模型在遥感应用中受限于需要大量领域特定标注数据和对复杂环境上下文理解能力有限的问题，而视觉语言模型在遥感领域的应用尚未充分探索。

Method: 将YOLO目标检测模型与多种视觉语言模型（LLaVA、ChatGPT、Gemini）集成，在标记和未标记遥感数据以及图像退化场景下进行评估。

Result: 在飞机检测和计数准确性方面，所有模型的平均MAE提升了48.46%，在原始和退化场景下都表现优异；在遥感图像全面理解方面，CLIPScore提升了6.17%。

Conclusion: 传统视觉模型与视觉语言模型的结合为更先进和高效的遥感图像分析铺平了道路，特别是在少样本学习场景中具有重要应用价值。

Abstract: Remote sensing has become a vital tool across sectors such as urban planning,
environmental monitoring, and disaster response. While the volume of data
generated has increased significantly, traditional vision models are often
constrained by the requirement for extensive domain-specific labelled data and
their limited ability to understand the context within complex environments.
Vision Language Models offer a complementary approach by integrating visual and
textual data; however, their application to remote sensing remains
underexplored, particularly given their generalist nature. This work
investigates the combination of vision models and VLMs to enhance image
analysis in remote sensing, with a focus on aircraft detection and scene
understanding. The integration of YOLO with VLMs such as LLaVA, ChatGPT, and
Gemini aims to achieve more accurate and contextually aware image
interpretation. Performance is evaluated on both labelled and unlabelled remote
sensing data, as well as degraded image scenarios which are crucial for remote
sensing. The findings show an average MAE improvement of 48.46% across models
in the accuracy of aircraft detection and counting, especially in challenging
conditions, in both raw and degraded scenarios. A 6.17% improvement in
CLIPScore for comprehensive understanding of remote sensing images is obtained.
The proposed approach combining traditional vision models and VLMs paves the
way for more advanced and efficient remote sensing image analysis, especially
in few-shot learning scenarios.

TL;DR: 开发并验证了一个基于AI的深度学习系统，用于检测前列腺癌中的筛状形态，该系统在内部和外部验证中表现出色，甚至超过了9位专家病理学家的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 前列腺癌中的筛状形态是预后不良的组织学特征，但存在报告不足和观察者间差异大的问题，需要开发AI系统来提高检测准确性。

Method: 使用EfficientNetV2-S编码器和多实例学习构建端到端的全玻片分类模型，在三个队列的640个前列腺穿刺活检样本上训练，并进行内部和外部验证。

Result: 模型在内部验证中AUC达0.97，Cohen's kappa为0.81；外部验证中AUC为0.90，kappa为0.55。在评估者间分析中，模型平均一致性最高（kappa: 0.66），优于所有9位病理学家（kappa: 0.35-0.62）。

Conclusion: 该AI模型在前列腺癌筛状形态检测方面达到病理学家水平，可提高诊断可靠性、标准化报告并改善治疗决策。

Abstract: Background: Cribriform morphology in prostate cancer is a histological
feature that indicates poor prognosis and contraindicates active surveillance.
However, it remains underreported and subject to significant interobserver
variability amongst pathologists. We aimed to develop and validate an AI-based
system to improve cribriform pattern detection.
  Methods: We created a deep learning model using an EfficientNetV2-S encoder
with multiple instance learning for end-to-end whole-slide classification. The
model was trained on 640 digitised prostate core needle biopsies from 430
patients, collected across three cohorts. It was validated internally (261
slides from 171 patients) and externally (266 slides, 104 patients from three
independent cohorts). Internal validation cohorts included laboratories or
scanners from the development set, while external cohorts used completely
independent instruments and laboratories. Annotations were provided by three
expert uropathologists with known high concordance. Additionally, we conducted
an inter-rater analysis and compared the model's performance against nine
expert uropathologists on 88 slides from the internal validation cohort.
  Results: The model showed strong internal validation performance (AUC: 0.97,
95% CI: 0.95-0.99; Cohen's kappa: 0.81, 95% CI: 0.72-0.89) and robust external
validation (AUC: 0.90, 95% CI: 0.86-0.93; Cohen's kappa: 0.55, 95% CI:
0.45-0.64). In our inter-rater analysis, the model achieved the highest average
agreement (Cohen's kappa: 0.66, 95% CI: 0.57-0.74), outperforming all nine
pathologists whose Cohen's kappas ranged from 0.35 to 0.62.
  Conclusion: Our AI model demonstrates pathologist-level performance for
cribriform morphology detection in prostate cancer. This approach could enhance
diagnostic reliability, standardise reporting, and improve treatment decisions
for prostate cancer patients.

### [5] [Joint Modeling of Big Five and HEXACO for Multimodal Apparent Personality-trait Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14203)
*Ryo Masumura,Shota Orihashi,Mana Ihori,Tomohiro Tanaka,Naoki Makishima,Taiga Yamane,Naotaka Kawata,Satoshi Suzuki,Taichi Katayama*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种联合建模Big Five和HEXACO人格特质的多模态识别方法，通过优化联合识别来提高人格特质识别的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要使用Big Five进行多模态人格特质识别，但缺乏对HEXACO的关注，特别是能够评估诚实-谦逊特质（与攻击性和报复性相关）的HEXACO模型。此外，机器学习建模时Big Five和HEXACO之间的关系尚未明确。

Method: 采用联合建模方法，优化同时识别Big Five和HEXACO人格特质，通过多模态人类行为数据进行建模。

Result: 在自我介绍视频数据集上的实验表明，所提出的方法能够有效识别Big Five和HEXACO人格特质。

Conclusion: 通过联合建模Big Five和HEXACO，该方法提高了多模态人类行为识别的意识，为更全面的人格特质评估提供了有效途径。

Abstract: This paper proposes a joint modeling method of the Big Five, which has long
been studied, and HEXACO, which has recently attracted attention in psychology,
for automatically recognizing apparent personality traits from multimodal human
behavior. Most previous studies have used the Big Five for multimodal apparent
personality-trait recognition. However, no study has focused on apparent HEXACO
which can evaluate an Honesty-Humility trait related to displaced aggression
and vengefulness, social-dominance orientation, etc. In addition, the
relationships between the Big Five and HEXACO when modeled by machine learning
have not been clarified. We expect awareness of multimodal human behavior to
improve by considering these relationships. The key advance of our proposed
method is to optimize jointly recognizing the Big Five and HEXACO. Experiments
using a self-introduction video dataset demonstrate that the proposed method
can effectively recognize the Big Five and HEXACO.

### [6] [NAPPure: Adversarial Purification for Robust Image Classification under Non-Additive Perturbations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14025)
*Junjie Nan,Jianing Li,Wei Chen,Mingkun Zhang,Xueqi Cheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出NAPPure框架，扩展对抗净化方法以处理非加性对抗扰动（如模糊、遮挡、扭曲），通过似然最大化分离干净图像和扰动参数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对抗净化方法主要针对加性扰动设计，对非加性扰动效果不佳，而现实世界中非加性扰动（模糊、遮挡、扭曲）很常见。

Method: 建立对抗图像生成过程，通过似然最大化分离底层干净图像和扰动参数。

Result: 在GTSRB和CIFAR-10数据集上的实验表明，NAPPure显著提升了图像分类模型对非加性扰动的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: NAPPure框架成功扩展了对抗净化的适用范围，能有效处理非加性对抗扰动。

Abstract: Adversarial purification has achieved great success in combating adversarial
image perturbations, which are usually assumed to be additive. However,
non-additive adversarial perturbations such as blur, occlusion, and distortion
are also common in the real world. Under such perturbations, existing
adversarial purification methods are much less effective since they are
designed to fit the additive nature. In this paper, we propose an extended
adversarial purification framework named NAPPure, which can further handle
non-additive perturbations. Specifically, we first establish the generation
process of an adversarial image, and then disentangle the underlying clean
image and perturbation parameters through likelihood maximization. Experiments
on GTSRB and CIFAR-10 datasets show that NAPPure significantly boosts the
robustness of image classification models against non-additive perturbations.

### [7] [Vgent: Graph-based Retrieval-Reasoning-Augmented Generation For Long Video Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14032)
*Xiaoqian Shen,Wenxuan Zhang,Jun Chen,Mohamed Elhoseiny*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Vgent是一个基于图结构的检索-推理增强生成框架，用于提升大视频语言模型在长视频理解方面的能力，通过结构化图表示和中间推理步骤来解决长视频处理中的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长视频理解面临处理大量视频token超出上下文窗口和保留长期序列信息的困难，现有检索增强生成方法在视频领域存在时间依赖破坏和无关信息干扰的问题。

Method: 提出两个关键创新：1) 使用结构化图表示视频，保留视频片段间的语义关系；2) 引入中间推理步骤，通过结构化验证减少检索噪声，显式聚合跨片段相关信息。

Result: 在三个长视频理解基准测试中，相比基础模型在MLVU上整体性能提升3.0%~5.4%，优于最先进的视频RAG方法8.6%。

Conclusion: Vgent框架通过图结构表示和中间推理有效解决了长视频理解中的关键挑战，显著提升了模型的性能表现。

Abstract: Understanding and reasoning over long videos pose significant challenges for
large video language models (LVLMs) due to the difficulty in processing
intensive video tokens beyond context window and retaining long-term sequential
information. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has demonstrated
effectiveness in processing long context for Large Language Models (LLMs);
however, applying RAG to long video faces challenges such as disrupted temporal
dependencies and inclusion of irrelevant information that can hinder accurate
reasoning. To address these limitations, we propose Vgent, a novel graph-based
retrieval-reasoning-augmented generation framework to enhance LVLMs for long
video understanding. Our approach introduces two key innovations: (i) It
represents videos by structured graphs with semantic relationships across video
clips preserved to improve retrieval effectiveness. (ii) It introduces an
intermediate reasoning step to mitigate the reasoning limitation of LVLMs,
which leverages structured verification to reduce retrieval noise and
facilitate the explicit aggregation of relevant information across clips,
resulting in more accurate and context-aware responses. We comprehensively
evaluate our framework with various open-source LVLMs on three long-video
understanding benchmarks. Our approach yielded an overall performance
improvement of $3.0\%\sim 5.4\%$ over base models on MLVU, and outperformed
state-of-the-art video RAG methods by $8.6\%$. Our code is publicly available
at https://xiaoqian-shen.github.io/Vgent.

### [8] [Synchronization of Multiple Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14051)
*Avihai Naaman,Ron Shapira Weber,Oren Freifeld*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TPL是一种基于原型的时间对齐框架，通过构建共享的紧凑1D表示来同步来自不同场景或生成AI的视频，无需穷举成对匹配。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 同步来自不同场景或生成AI的视频具有挑战性，因为存在不同的主题、背景和非线性时间错位，传统简单时间偏移方法无法有效处理。

Method: TPL框架从预训练模型提取的高维嵌入中构建共享的紧凑1D表示，通过学习统一原型序列来锚定关键动作阶段。

Result: 实验表明TPL在多个数据集上提高了同步准确性、效率和鲁棒性，包括细粒度帧检索和阶段分类任务，并首次解决了多个生成AI视频的同步问题。

Conclusion: TPL为复杂视频同步问题提供了有效的原型学习解决方案，特别适用于处理生成AI视频的同步挑战。

Abstract: Synchronizing videos captured simultaneously from multiple cameras in the
same scene is often easy and typically requires only simple time shifts.
However, synchronizing videos from different scenes or, more recently,
generative AI videos, poses a far more complex challenge due to diverse
subjects, backgrounds, and nonlinear temporal misalignment. We propose Temporal
Prototype Learning (TPL), a prototype-based framework that constructs a shared,
compact 1D representation from high-dimensional embeddings extracted by any of
various pretrained models. TPL robustly aligns videos by learning a unified
prototype sequence that anchors key action phases, thereby avoiding exhaustive
pairwise matching. Our experiments show that TPL improves synchronization
accuracy, efficiency, and robustness across diverse datasets, including
fine-grained frame retrieval and phase classification tasks. Importantly, TPL
is the first approach to mitigate synchronization issues in multiple generative
AI videos depicting the same action. Our code and a new multiple video
synchronization dataset are available at https://bgu-cs-vil.github.io/TPL/

TL;DR: 提出了一种从少量非结构化手机图像创建超真实、身份保持的3D虚拟形象的零样本流程，解决了现有方法在几何一致性和高频细节方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法面临几何不一致、幻觉问题导致身份保持退化，以及合成数据训练模型无法捕捉皮肤皱纹、细发等高频细节，限制了真实感。

Method: 引入两个关键贡献：(1) 生成式规范化模块，将多个非结构化视图处理为标准一致表示；(2) 基于Transformer的模型，在从真实人物圆顶捕捉获得的高斯溅射虚拟形象新数据集上训练。采用"捕捉、规范化、溅射"流程。

Result: 从非结构化照片生成具有引人注目的真实感和鲁棒身份保持的静态四分之一身体虚拟形象。

Conclusion: 该方法通过生成式规范化和高斯溅射技术，成功实现了从少量非结构化图像创建身份保持的高真实感3D虚拟形象。

Abstract: We present a novel, zero-shot pipeline for creating hyperrealistic,
identity-preserving 3D avatars from a few unstructured phone images. Existing
methods face several challenges: single-view approaches suffer from geometric
inconsistencies and hallucinations, degrading identity preservation, while
models trained on synthetic data fail to capture high-frequency details like
skin wrinkles and fine hair, limiting realism. Our method introduces two key
contributions: (1) a generative canonicalization module that processes multiple
unstructured views into a standardized, consistent representation, and (2) a
transformer-based model trained on a new, large-scale dataset of high-fidelity
Gaussian splatting avatars derived from dome captures of real people. This
"Capture, Canonicalize, Splat" pipeline produces static quarter-body avatars
with compelling realism and robust identity preservation from unstructured
photos.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代显微镜生成的大型2D和3D数据集需要更高效的计算方法，现有工具在可扩展性、GPU加速和与现代科学计算工作流的集成方面存在局限。

Method: cubic通过CuPy和RAPIDS cuCIM为广泛使用的SciPy和scikit-image API提供设备无关的GPU加速替代方案，自动在GPU和CPU之间调度操作。

Result: 在单个操作和现有去卷积与分割流程的复现中，cubic实现了显著的加速，同时保持算法保真度。

Conclusion: cubic为可扩展、可重现的生物图像分析建立了坚实基础，能够与更广泛的Python科学计算生态系统集成，支持交互式探索和自动化高通量分析工作流。

Abstract: Quantitative analysis of multidimensional biological images is useful for
understanding complex cellular phenotypes and accelerating advances in
biomedical research. As modern microscopy generates ever-larger 2D and 3D
datasets, existing computational approaches are increasingly limited by their
scalability, efficiency, and integration with modern scientific computing
workflows. Existing bioimage analysis tools often lack application programmable
interfaces (APIs), do not support graphics processing unit (GPU) acceleration,
lack broad 3D image processing capabilities, and/or have poor interoperability
for compute-heavy workflows. Here, we introduce cubic, an open-source Python
library that addresses these challenges by augmenting widely used SciPy and
scikit-image APIs with GPU-accelerated alternatives from CuPy and RAPIDS cuCIM.
cubic's API is device-agnostic and dispatches operations to GPU when data
reside on the device and otherwise executes on CPU, seamlessly accelerating a
broad range of image processing routines. This approach enables GPU
acceleration of existing bioimage analysis workflows, from preprocessing to
segmentation and feature extraction for 2D and 3D data. We evaluate cubic both
by benchmarking individual operations and by reproducing existing deconvolution
and segmentation pipelines, achieving substantial speedups while maintaining
algorithmic fidelity. These advances establish a robust foundation for
scalable, reproducible bioimage analysis that integrates with the broader
Python scientific computing ecosystem, including other GPU-accelerated methods,
enabling both interactive exploration and automated high-throughput analysis
workflows. cubic is openly available at

Abstract: We introduce a framework that enables both multi-view character consistency
and 3D camera control in video diffusion models through a novel customization
data pipeline. We train the character consistency component with recorded
volumetric capture performances re-rendered with diverse camera trajectories
via 4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS), lighting variability obtained with a video
relighting model. We fine-tune state-of-the-art open-source video diffusion
models on this data to provide strong multi-view identity preservation, precise
camera control, and lighting adaptability. Our framework also supports core
capabilities for virtual production, including multi-subject generation using
two approaches: joint training and noise blending, the latter enabling
efficient composition of independently customized models at inference time; it
also achieves scene and real-life video customization as well as control over
motion and spatial layout during customization. Extensive experiments show
improved video quality, higher personalization accuracy, and enhanced camera
control and lighting adaptability, advancing the integration of video
generation into virtual production. Our project page is available at:

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于位平面的AI生成图像检测方法，通过位平面引导的噪声图像生成和最大梯度补丁选择来放大噪声信号，实现了98.9%的平均准确率和毫秒级的处理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于重建误差的AI图像检测方法计算成本高且无法捕捉原始图像中的固有噪声特征，需要更高效准确的检测方案。

Method: 使用位平面图像处理技术提取噪声特征，设计最大梯度补丁选择机制计算噪声分数，并构建轻量级分类器（噪声分类器和噪声引导分类器）。

Result: 在GenImage基准测试中达到98.9%的平均准确率（提升11.9%），跨生成器泛化能力强，从GAN到Diffusion准确率98.2%，从Diffusion到GAN准确率99.2%，处理速度比现有方法快近百倍。

Conclusion: 该方法通过位平面噪声特征提取和梯度补丁选择，实现了高效准确的AI生成图像检测，具有优异的跨生成器泛化能力和实时处理性能。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of GAN and Diffusion models makes it more difficult to
distinguish AI-generated images from real ones. Recent studies often use
image-based reconstruction errors as an important feature for determining
whether an image is AI-generated. However, these approaches typically incur
high computational costs and also fail to capture intrinsic noisy features
present in the raw images. To solve these problems, we innovatively refine
error extraction by using bit-plane-based image processing, as lower bit planes
indeed represent noise patterns in images. We introduce an effective bit-planes
guided noisy image generation and exploit various image normalization
strategies, including scaling and thresholding. Then, to amplify the noise
signal for easier AI-generated image detection, we design a maximum gradient
patch selection that applies multi-directional gradients to compute the noise
score and selects the region with the highest score. Finally, we propose a
lightweight and effective classification head and explore two different
structures: noise-based classifier and noise-guided classifier. Extensive
experiments on the GenImage benchmark demonstrate the outstanding performance
of our method, which achieves an average accuracy of \textbf{98.9\%}
(\textbf{11.9}\%~$\uparrow$) and shows excellent cross-generator generalization
capability. Particularly, our method achieves an accuracy of over 98.2\% from
GAN to Diffusion and over 99.2\% from Diffusion to GAN. Moreover, it performs
error extraction at the millisecond level, nearly a hundred times faster than
existing methods. The code is at https://github.com/hongsong-wang/LOTA.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统深度伪造检测方法依赖手动设计的音素-视位对齐阈值、基础帧级一致性检查或单模态策略，无法有效识别由GANs、扩散模型和神经渲染技术生成的现代深度伪造内容。

Method: 使用多模态音频-视觉框架，整合语言、动态面部运动和面部识别线索，分析音素序列、唇部几何数据和先进的面部身份嵌入。

Result: 该方法通过识别多个互补模态之间的不一致性，显著提高了对细微深度伪造篡改的检测能力。

Conclusion: PIA框架通过多模态分析有效解决了传统检测方法在识别先进生成模型产生的深度伪造内容方面的局限性。

Abstract: The rise of manipulated media has made deepfakes a particularly insidious
threat, involving various generative manipulations such as lip-sync
modifications, face-swaps, and avatar-driven facial synthesis. Conventional
detection methods, which predominantly depend on manually designed
phoneme-viseme alignment thresholds, fundamental frame-level consistency
checks, or a unimodal detection strategy, inadequately identify modern-day
deepfakes generated by advanced generative models such as GANs, diffusion
models, and neural rendering techniques. These advanced techniques generate
nearly perfect individual frames yet inadvertently create minor temporal
discrepancies frequently overlooked by traditional detectors. We present a
novel multimodal audio-visual framework, Phoneme-Temporal and Identity-Dynamic
Analysis(PIA), incorporating language, dynamic face motion, and facial
identification cues to address these limitations. We utilize phoneme sequences,
lip geometry data, and advanced facial identity embeddings. This integrated
method significantly improves the detection of subtle deepfake alterations by
identifying inconsistencies across multiple complementary modalities. Code is

Abstract: Optical camera communication (OCC) represents a promising visible light
communication technology. Nonetheless, typical OCC systems utilizing
frame-based cameras are encumbered by limitations, including low bit rate and
high processing load. To address these issues, OCC system utilizing an
event-based vision sensor (EVS) as receivers have been proposed. The EVS
enables high-speed, low-latency, and robust communication due to its
asynchronous operation and high dynamic range. In existing event-based OCC
systems, conventional modulation schemes such as on-off keying (OOK) and pulse
position modulation have been applied, however, to the best of our knowledge,
no modulation method has been proposed that fully exploits the unique
characteristics of the EVS. This paper proposes a novel modulation scheme,
called the event interval modulation (EIM) scheme, specifically designed for
event-based OCC. EIM enables improvement in transmission speed by modulating
information using the intervals between events. This paper proposes a
theoretical model of EIM and conducts a proof-of-concept experiment. First, the
parameters of the EVS are tuned and customized to optimize the frequency
response specifically for EIM. Then, the maximum modulation order usable in EIM
is determined experimentally. We conduct transmission experiments based on the
obtained parameters. Finally, we report successful transmission at 28 kbps over
10 meters and 8.4 kbps over 50 meters in an indoor environment. This sets a new
benchmark for bit rate in event-based OCC systems.

TL;DR: 提出了MACE方法，通过混合专家网络和负载均衡策略，在大规模场景中实现高效定位和高质量渲染


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大规模场景中定位和渲染的计算成本高的问题，传统场景坐标回归方法在扩展到大规模场景时受限于单个网络的容量

Method: 引入门控网络隐式分类和选择子网络，每次推理只激活单个子网络；提出无辅助损失负载均衡策略提升定位精度

Result: 在剑桥测试集上仅需10分钟训练即可获得高质量渲染结果，显著降低计算成本同时保持更高精度

Conclusion: MACE框架为大规模场景应用提供了高效的解决方案，在减少成本的同时维持了高精度

Abstract: Efficient localization and high-quality rendering in large-scale scenes
remain a significant challenge due to the computational cost involved. While
Scene Coordinate Regression (SCR) methods perform well in small-scale
localization, they are limited by the capacity of a single network when
extended to large-scale scenes. To address these challenges, we propose the
Mixed Expert-based Accelerated Coordinate Encoding method (MACE), which enables
efficient localization and high-quality rendering in large-scale scenes.
Inspired by the remarkable capabilities of MOE in large model domains, we
introduce a gating network to implicitly classify and select sub-networks,
ensuring that only a single sub-network is activated during each inference.
Furtheremore, we present Auxiliary-Loss-Free Load Balancing(ALF-LB) strategy to
enhance the localization accuracy on large-scale scene. Our framework provides
a significant reduction in costs while maintaining higher precision, offering
an efficient solution for large-scale scene applications. Additional
experiments on the Cambridge test set demonstrate that our method achieves
high-quality rendering results with merely 10 minutes of training.

TL;DR: 提出IPRO方法，通过强化学习优化视频扩散模型，解决图像到视频生成中的人脸身份一致性问题，特别是在人脸占图像比例较小时的身份保持挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像到视频生成模型在人脸身份一致性方面存在困难，特别是当视频中人脸表情变化大、运动剧烈或人脸在图像中占比很小时，身份保持成为关键挑战。

Method: 基于强化学习的身份保持奖励引导优化框架，使用人脸身份评分器优化扩散模型，通过反向传播奖励信号和KL散度正则化来稳定训练，提出新颖的面部评分机制将真实视频中的人脸作为特征池。

Result: 在Wan 2.2 I2V模型和内部I2V模型上的广泛实验证明了该方法的有效性。

Conclusion: IPRO方法能够有效提升图像到视频生成中的人脸身份一致性，无需引入额外模块或改变模型架构，提供了一种直接有效的优化算法。

Abstract: Recent advances in image-to-video (I2V) generation have achieved remarkable
progress in synthesizing high-quality, temporally coherent videos from static
images. Among all the applications of I2V, human-centric video generation
includes a large portion. However, existing I2V models encounter difficulties
in maintaining identity consistency between the input human image and the
generated video, especially when the person in the video exhibits significant
expression changes and movements. This issue becomes critical when the human
face occupies merely a small fraction of the image. Since humans are highly
sensitive to identity variations, this poses a critical yet under-explored
challenge in I2V generation. In this paper, we propose Identity-Preserving
Reward-guided Optimization (IPRO), a novel video diffusion framework based on
reinforcement learning to enhance identity preservation. Instead of introducing
auxiliary modules or altering model architectures, our approach introduces a
direct and effective tuning algorithm that optimizes diffusion models using a
face identity scorer. To improve performance and accelerate convergence, our
method backpropagates the reward signal through the last steps of the sampling
chain, enabling richer gradient feedback. We also propose a novel facial
scoring mechanism that treats faces in ground-truth videos as facial feature
pools, providing multi-angle facial information to enhance generalization. A
KL-divergence regularization is further incorporated to stabilize training and
prevent overfitting to the reward signal. Extensive experiments on Wan 2.2 I2V
model and our in-house I2V model demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

Motivation: 现有方法如VACE和Phantom在特定主题视频生成方面有进展，但在多人物动态交互场景中难以保持身份一致性，这在实际应用中至关重要。

Method: 构建基于大规模偏好数据集的视频奖励模型，使用带有人工标注和合成失真数据的成对标注，然后采用专门针对多人物一致性的GRPO变体来优化VACE和Phantom。

Result: 实验显示Identity-GRPO在人物一致性指标上比基线方法提升高达18.9%，并通过消融研究评估了标注质量和设计选择对策略优化的影响。

Conclusion: 该方法为强化学习与个性化视频生成的结合提供了可行见解，显著提升了多人物视频生成中的身份保持能力。

Abstract: While advanced methods like VACE and Phantom have advanced video generation
for specific subjects in diverse scenarios, they struggle with multi-human
identity preservation in dynamic interactions, where consistent identities
across multiple characters are critical. To address this, we propose
Identity-GRPO, a human feedback-driven optimization pipeline for refining
multi-human identity-preserving video generation. First, we construct a video
reward model trained on a large-scale preference dataset containing
human-annotated and synthetic distortion data, with pairwise annotations
focused on maintaining human consistency throughout the video. We then employ a
GRPO variant tailored for multi-human consistency, which greatly enhances both
VACE and Phantom. Through extensive ablation studies, we evaluate the impact of
annotation quality and design choices on policy optimization. Experiments show
that Identity-GRPO achieves up to 18.9% improvement in human consistency
metrics over baseline methods, offering actionable insights for aligning
reinforcement learning with personalized video generation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出MatchAttention机制和MatchDecoder，通过动态匹配相对位置和分层解码器实现高效跨视图匹配，在多个基准测试中达到最先进性能，同时保持低计算复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决高分辨率图像跨视图匹配的挑战，包括二次复杂度和缺乏显式匹配约束的问题。

Method: 提出MatchAttention机制，使用BilinearSoftmax实现连续可微的滑动窗口注意力采样；设计分层跨视图解码器MatchDecoder；引入门控交叉MatchAttention和一致性约束损失处理遮挡问题。

Result: MatchStereo-B在Middlebury基准测试中排名第一，KITTI分辨率推理仅需29ms；MatchStereo-T可在0.1秒内处理4K UHD图像，仅使用3GB GPU内存；在KITTI 2012、KITTI 2015、ETH3D和Spring flow数据集上达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: 结合高精度和低计算复杂度，实现了实时、高分辨率、高精度的跨视图匹配。

Abstract: Cross-view matching is fundamentally achieved through cross-attention
mechanisms. However, matching of high-resolution images remains challenging due
to the quadratic complexity and lack of explicit matching constraints in the
existing cross-attention. This paper proposes an attention mechanism,
MatchAttention, that dynamically matches relative positions. The relative
position determines the attention sampling center of the key-value pairs given
a query. Continuous and differentiable sliding-window attention sampling is
achieved by the proposed BilinearSoftmax. The relative positions are
iteratively updated through residual connections across layers by embedding
them into the feature channels. Since the relative position is exactly the
learning target for cross-view matching, an efficient hierarchical cross-view
decoder, MatchDecoder, is designed with MatchAttention as its core component.
To handle cross-view occlusions, gated cross-MatchAttention and a
consistency-constrained loss are proposed. These two components collectively
mitigate the impact of occlusions in both forward and backward passes, allowing
the model to focus more on learning matching relationships. When applied to
stereo matching, MatchStereo-B ranked 1st in average error on the public
Middlebury benchmark and requires only 29ms for KITTI-resolution inference.
MatchStereo-T can process 4K UHD images in 0.1 seconds using only 3GB of GPU
memory. The proposed models also achieve state-of-the-art performance on KITTI
2012, KITTI 2015, ETH3D, and Spring flow datasets. The combination of high
accuracy and low computational complexity makes real-time, high-resolution, and
high-accuracy cross-view matching possible. Code is available at

TL;DR: PL-SE-ADA是一个用于脑部MRI图像领域协调和可解释表示学习的框架，通过两个编码器分离域不变和域特定特征，结合对抗训练和图像重建，在保持疾病相关信息的同时提供高可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像（如MRI）在不同成像站点之间存在域偏移，这会降低机器学习在疾病分类等任务中的性能。现有方法虽然有效但缺乏可解释性，这在医疗应用中至关重要。

Method: 提出PL-SE-ADA框架，包含两个编码器分别提取域不变特征和域特定特征，一个解码器进行图像重建，以及一个域预测器。通过对抗训练和基于特征和的重建机制，确保协调性和信息保持。

Result: 与现有方法相比，PL-SE-ADA在图像重建、疾病分类和域识别方面达到同等或更好的性能，并能可视化域无关的脑部特征和域特定成分。

Conclusion: PL-SE-ADA不仅实现了有效的领域协调，还提供了整个框架的高可解释性，在医疗应用中具有重要价值。

Abstract: Medical images like MR scans often show domain shifts across imaging sites
due to scanner and protocol differences, which degrade machine learning
performance in tasks such as disease classification. Domain harmonization is
thus a critical research focus. Recent approaches encode brain images
$\boldsymbol{x}$ into a low-dimensional latent space $\boldsymbol{z}$, then
disentangle it into $\boldsymbol{z_u}$ (domain-invariant) and
$\boldsymbol{z_d}$ (domain-specific), achieving strong results. However, these
methods often lack interpretability$-$an essential requirement in medical
applications$-$leaving practical issues unresolved. We propose
Pseudo-Linear-Style Encoder Adversarial Domain Adaptation (PL-SE-ADA), a
general framework for domain harmonization and interpretable representation
learning that preserves disease-relevant information in brain MR images.
PL-SE-ADA includes two encoders $f_E$ and $f_{SE}$ to extract
$\boldsymbol{z_u}$ and $\boldsymbol{z_d}$, a decoder to reconstruct the image
$f_D$, and a domain predictor $g_D$. Beyond adversarial training between the
encoder and domain predictor, the model learns to reconstruct the input image
$\boldsymbol{x}$ by summing reconstructions from $\boldsymbol{z_u}$ and
$\boldsymbol{z_d}$, ensuring both harmonization and informativeness. Compared
to prior methods, PL-SE-ADA achieves equal or better performance in image
reconstruction, disease classification, and domain recognition. It also enables
visualization of both domain-independent brain features and domain-specific
components, offering high interpretability across the entire framework.

TL;DR: GauSSmart是一种混合方法，将2D基础模型与3D高斯溅射重建相结合，通过2D分割先验和特征嵌入指导高斯溅射的密集化和细化，提升稀疏区域的覆盖度和细节保持能力。


<details>

Motivation: 高斯溅射方法在大规模数据集上表现良好，但在稀疏覆盖区域难以捕捉精细细节或保持真实感，主要受限于稀疏3D训练数据的固有局限性。

Method: 整合2D计算机视觉技术（凸滤波和DINO等基础模型的语义特征监督），利用2D分割先验和高维特征嵌入来指导高斯溅射的密集化和细化过程。

Result: 在三个数据集上的验证表明，GauSSmart在大多数评估场景中持续优于现有高斯溅射方法。

Conclusion: 混合2D-3D方法具有显著潜力，2D基础模型与3D重建管道的精心组合可以克服各自方法的固有局限性。

Abstract: Scene reconstruction has emerged as a central challenge in computer vision,
with approaches such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and Gaussian Splatting
achieving remarkable progress. While Gaussian Splatting demonstrates strong
performance on large-scale datasets, it often struggles to capture fine details
or maintain realism in regions with sparse coverage, largely due to the
inherent limitations of sparse 3D training data.
  In this work, we propose GauSSmart, a hybrid method that effectively bridges
2D foundational models and 3D Gaussian Splatting reconstruction. Our approach
integrates established 2D computer vision techniques, including convex
filtering and semantic feature supervision from foundational models such as
DINO, to enhance Gaussian-based scene reconstruction. By leveraging 2D
segmentation priors and high-dimensional feature embeddings, our method guides
the densification and refinement of Gaussian splats, improving coverage in
underrepresented areas and preserving intricate structural details.
  We validate our approach across three datasets, where GauSSmart consistently
outperforms existing Gaussian Splatting in the majority of evaluated scenes.
Our results demonstrate the significant potential of hybrid 2D-3D approaches,
highlighting how the thoughtful combination of 2D foundational models with 3D
reconstruction pipelines can overcome the limitations inherent in either
approach alone.

Conclusion: 因果推断是解决组织病理学图像分析中域偏移问题的有力工具，具有重要应用潜力

Abstract: Domain shift in histopathology, often caused by differences in acquisition
processes or data sources, poses a major challenge to the generalization
ability of deep learning models. Existing methods primarily rely on modeling
statistical correlations by aligning feature distributions or introducing
statistical variation, yet they often overlook causal relationships. In this
work, we propose a novel causal-inference-based framework that leverages
semantic features while mitigating the impact of confounders. Our method
implements the front-door principle by designing transformation strategies that
explicitly incorporate mediators and observed tissue slides. We validate our
method on the CAMELYON17 dataset and a private histopathology dataset,
demonstrating consistent performance gains across unseen domains. As a result,
our approach achieved up to a 7% improvement in both the CAMELYON17 dataset and
the private histopathology dataset, outperforming existing baselines. These
results highlight the potential of causal inference as a powerful tool for
addressing domain shift in histopathology image analysis.

Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在多模态任务中表现出色，但仍容易产生幻觉，过度依赖单一模态或记忆训练数据而缺乏视觉基础。

Method: 训练免费的三层对比解码加水印方法：选择解码层中的成熟层和业余层；使用水印相关问题识别视觉基础层；应用三层对比解码生成最终输出。

Conclusion: 提出的三层对比解码加水印方法能有效减少大型视觉语言模型的幻觉问题，提高输出的视觉基础性。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have recently shown promising results on
various multimodal tasks, even achieving human-comparable performance in
certain cases. Nevertheless, LVLMs remain prone to hallucinations -- they often
rely heavily on a single modality or memorize training data without properly
grounding their outputs. To address this, we propose a training-free, tri-layer
contrastive decoding with watermarking, which proceeds in three steps: (1)
select a mature layer and an amateur layer among the decoding layers, (2)
identify a pivot layer using a watermark-related question to assess whether the
layer is visually well-grounded, and (3) apply tri-layer contrastive decoding
to generate the final output. Experiments on public benchmarks such as POPE,
MME and AMBER demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance
in reducing hallucinations in LVLMs and generates more visually grounded
responses.

Motivation: 虹膜生物识别系统易受呈现攻击（如人工眼睛、打印图像、美瞳镜片），但现有PAD方法面临训练数据稀缺的挑战，因为构建和成像呈现攻击存在困难。

Method: MID-StyleGAN结合扩散模型和GAN的优势，采用多领域架构实现真实眼部图像与不同呈现攻击领域之间的转换，并使用针对眼部数据的自适应损失函数保持领域一致性。

Result: 在LivDet2020数据集上，1%错误检测率下的真实检测率从93.41%提升到98.72%，显著提高了PAD系统的性能。

Conclusion: MID-StyleGAN能生成高质量合成眼部图像，有效解决虹膜和眼部生物识别中的数据稀缺问题，为PAD系统提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: An iris biometric system can be compromised by presentation attacks (PAs)
where artifacts such as artificial eyes, printed eye images, or cosmetic
contact lenses are presented to the system. To counteract this, several
presentation attack detection (PAD) methods have been developed. However, there
is a scarcity of datasets for training and evaluating iris PAD techniques due
to the implicit difficulties in constructing and imaging PAs. To address this,
we introduce the Multi-domain Image Translative Diffusion StyleGAN
(MID-StyleGAN), a new framework for generating synthetic ocular images that
captures the PA and bonafide characteristics in multiple domains such as
bonafide, printed eyes and cosmetic contact lens. MID-StyleGAN combines the
strengths of diffusion models and generative adversarial networks (GANs) to
produce realistic and diverse synthetic data. Our approach utilizes a
multi-domain architecture that enables the translation between bonafide ocular
images and different PA domains. The model employs an adaptive loss function
tailored for ocular data to maintain domain consistency. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that MID-StyleGAN outperforms existing methods in generating
high-quality synthetic ocular images. The generated data was used to
significantly enhance the performance of PAD systems, providing a scalable
solution to the data scarcity problem in iris and ocular biometrics. For
example, on the LivDet2020 dataset, the true detect rate at 1% false detect
rate improved from 93.41% to 98.72%, showcasing the impact of the proposed
method.

Conclusion: VaCo展示了在视觉理解方面的卓越能力，为多模态大语言模型的视觉中心优化提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) integrate image features from visual
encoders with LLMs, demonstrating advanced comprehension capabilities. However,
mainstream MLLMs are solely supervised by the next-token prediction of textual
tokens, neglecting critical vision-centric information essential for analytical
abilities. To track this dilemma, we introduce VaCo, which optimizes MLLM
representations through Vision-Centric activation and Coordination from
multiple vision foundation models (VFMs). VaCo introduces visual discriminative
alignment to integrate task-aware perceptual features extracted from VFMs,
thereby unifying the optimization of both textual and visual outputs in MLLMs.
Specifically, we incorporate the learnable Modular Task Queries (MTQs) and
Visual Alignment Layers (VALs) into MLLMs, activating specific visual signals
under the supervision of diverse VFMs. To coordinate representation conflicts
across VFMs, the crafted Token Gateway Mask (TGM) restricts the information
flow among multiple groups of MTQs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VaCo
significantly improves the performance of different MLLMs on various
benchmarks, showcasing its superior capabilities in visual comprehension.

constraints during matching, improving correspondence accuracy. Additionally,
we introduce a novel pose block that combines a GRU recurrent unit with

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLMs在细粒度空间感知能力上存在不足，如生成详细区域描述和精确定位对象的能力有限，且无法满足用户对细粒度空间理解的需求。问题源于现有方法主要关注调整MLLMs来建模预标注指令数据，缺乏对MLLMs实际响应的直接监督。

Conclusion: SPR方法通过奖励详细且定位准确的空间描述，成功增强了MLLMs的细粒度空间理解能力，为解决MLLMs在空间感知方面的不足提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models~(MLLMs) have demonstrated promising spatial
understanding capabilities, such as referencing and grounding object
descriptions. Despite their successes, MLLMs still fall short in fine-grained
spatial perception abilities, such as generating detailed region descriptions
or accurately localizing objects. Additionally, they often fail to respond to
the user's requirements for desired fine-grained spatial understanding. This
issue might arise because existing approaches primarily focus on tuning MLLMs
to model pre-annotated instruction data to inject spatial knowledge, without
direct supervision of MLLMs' actual responses. We address this issue by SPR, a
Spatial Preference Rewarding~(SPR) approach that enhances MLLMs' spatial
capabilities by rewarding MLLMs' detailed responses with precise object
localization over vague or inaccurate responses. With randomly selected image
regions and region descriptions from MLLMs, SPR introduces semantic and
localization scores to comprehensively evaluate the text quality and
localization quality in MLLM-generated descriptions. We also refine the MLLM
descriptions with better localization accuracy and pair the best-scored

*Dongnam Byun,Jungwon Park,Jumgmin Ko,Changin Choi,Wonjong Rhee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DOS方法通过修改CLIP文本嵌入来改善多对象图像生成，解决了对象忽略和混合问题，在人类评估中显著优于竞争方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到图像生成模型在处理多对象提示时经常出现对象忽略或对象混合问题，特别是在相似形状、相似纹理、不同背景偏差和多个对象等场景中。

Method: 提出DOS方法，基于CLIP嵌入的两个关键观察，在将文本嵌入传递给文本到图像模型之前修改三种类型的CLIP文本嵌入。

Result: DOS持续提高了多对象图像生成的成功率并减少了对象混合。在人类评估中，DOS在四个基准测试中获得了比四种竞争方法多26.24%-43.04%的投票。

Conclusion: DOS是改善多对象图像生成的实用有效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent progress in text-to-image (T2I) generative models has led to
significant improvements in generating high-quality images aligned with text
prompts. However, these models still struggle with prompts involving multiple
objects, often resulting in object neglect or object mixing. Through extensive
studies, we identify four problematic scenarios, Similar Shapes, Similar
Textures, Dissimilar Background Biases, and Many Objects, where inter-object
relationships frequently lead to such failures. Motivated by two key
observations about CLIP embeddings, we propose DOS (Directional Object
Separation), a method that modifies three types of CLIP text embeddings before
passing them into text-to-image models. Experimental results show that DOS
consistently improves the success rate of multi-object image generation and
reduces object mixing. In human evaluations, DOS significantly outperforms four
competing methods, receiving 26.24%-43.04% more votes across four benchmarks.
These results highlight DOS as a practical and effective solution for improving
multi-object image generation.

*Danish Ali,Ajmal Mian,Naveed Akhtar,Ghulam Mubashar Hassan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出DRBD-Mamba模型，通过双分辨率双向Mamba架构和空间填充曲线技术，在保持高分割精度的同时实现15倍效率提升，解决了脑肿瘤分割中计算开销大和鲁棒性不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Mamba模型在脑肿瘤分割中存在显著计算开销，且在不同BraTS数据分区下的鲁棒性尚未充分探索，需要更高效可靠的解决方案。

Method: 使用双分辨率双向Mamba架构，结合空间填充曲线进行3D到1D特征映射，提出门控融合模块自适应整合前后向上下文，并采用量化块离散化特征以提高鲁棒性。

Result: 在BraTS2023测试集上，全肿瘤、肿瘤核心和增强肿瘤的Dice指标分别提升0.10%、1.75%和0.93%；在五个系统折叠评估中，肿瘤核心和增强肿瘤平均Dice分别提升0.86%和1.45%，同时效率提升15倍。

Conclusion: DRBD-Mamba模型在保持高分割精度的同时显著提升了计算效率，证明了其在脑肿瘤分割任务中的鲁棒性和实用性优势。

Abstract: Accurate brain tumor segmentation is significant for clinical diagnosis and
treatment. It is challenging due to the heterogeneity of tumor subregions.
Mamba-based State Space Models have demonstrated promising performance.
However, they incur significant computational overhead due to sequential
feature computation across multiple spatial axes. Moreover, their robustness
across diverse BraTS data partitions remains largely unexplored, leaving a
critical gap in reliable evaluation. To address these limitations, we propose
dual-resolution bi-directional Mamba (DRBD-Mamba), an efficient 3D segmentation
model that captures multi-scale long-range dependencies with minimal
computational overhead. We leverage a space-filling curve to preserve spatial
locality during 3D-to-1D feature mapping, thereby reducing reliance on
computationally expensive multi-axial feature scans. To enrich feature
representation, we propose a gated fusion module that adaptively integrates
forward and reverse contexts, along with a quantization block that discretizes
features to improve robustness. In addition, we propose five systematic folds
on BraTS2023 for rigorous evaluation of segmentation techniques under diverse
conditions and present detailed analysis of common failure scenarios. On the
20\% test set used by recent methods, our model achieves Dice improvements of
0.10\% for whole tumor, 1.75\% for tumor core, and 0.93\% for enhancing tumor.
Evaluations on the proposed systematic five folds demonstrate that our model
maintains competitive whole tumor accuracy while achieving clear average Dice
gains of 0.86\% for tumor core and 1.45\% for enhancing tumor over existing
state-of-the-art. Furthermore, our model attains 15 times improvement in
efficiency while maintaining high segmentation accuracy, highlighting its
robustness and computational advantage over existing approaches.

TL;DR: BoardVision是一个用于主板组装级缺陷检测的可复现框架，通过集成YOLOv7和Faster R-CNN模型，提出轻量级集成方法CTV Voter来平衡精度和召回率，并评估了在实际扰动下的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有PCB检测研究主要针对裸板或线路级缺陷，而主板组装级检测研究不足，需要开发能够检测螺丝缺失、风扇线松动和表面划痕等组装级缺陷的系统。

Method: 使用YOLOv7和Faster R-CNN作为代表性检测器，在MiracleFactory主板数据集上进行基准测试，并提出轻量级集成方法Confidence-Temporal Voting (CTV Voter)来平衡精度和召回率。

Result: YOLOv7在精度方面表现优异但在召回率方面表现不足，Faster R-CNN则相反。CTV Voter通过可解释规则有效平衡了精度和召回率，并在实际扰动下表现出稳定性挑战。

Conclusion: 该研究展示了计算机视觉技术如何从基准测试结果过渡到实际的主板组装制造质量保证，并发布了可部署的GUI驱动检测工具。

Abstract: Motherboard defect detection is critical for ensuring reliability in
high-volume electronics manufacturing. While prior research in PCB inspection
has largely targeted bare-board or trace-level defects, assembly-level
inspection of full motherboards inspection remains underexplored. In this work,
we present BoardVision, a reproducible framework for detecting assembly-level
defects such as missing screws, loose fan wiring, and surface scratches. We
benchmark two representative detectors - YOLOv7 and Faster R-CNN, under
controlled conditions on the MiracleFactory motherboard dataset, providing the
first systematic comparison in this domain. To mitigate the limitations of
single models, where YOLO excels in precision but underperforms in recall and
Faster R-CNN shows the reverse, we propose a lightweight ensemble,
Confidence-Temporal Voting (CTV Voter), that balances precision and recall
through interpretable rules. We further evaluate robustness under realistic
perturbations including sharpness, brightness, and orientation changes,
highlighting stability challenges often overlooked in motherboard defect
detection. Finally, we release a deployable GUI-driven inspection tool that
bridges research evaluation with operator usability. Together, these
contributions demonstrate how computer vision techniques can transition from
benchmark results to practical quality assurance for assembly-level motherboard
manufacturing.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为DCMIL的双课程对比多实例学习模型，用于从全切片图像中高效预测癌症预后，无需密集标注，在12种癌症类型上表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 计算病理学在利用全切片图像量化形态异质性和开发客观预后模型方面具有潜力，但面临千兆像素输入的计算瓶颈和密集标注稀缺的挑战。现有方法常忽略多放大倍数下的细粒度信息和肿瘤微环境变化。

Method: 采用易到难的渐进表示学习模型DCMIL，通过双课程对比多实例学习处理全切片图像，直接将其转换为预后预测，不依赖密集标注。

Result: 在12种癌症类型（5,954名患者，1254万张图像块）上的广泛实验表明，DCMIL优于标准基于WSI的预后模型，能识别细粒度预后显著区域，提供稳健的实例不确定性估计，并捕捉正常与肿瘤组织的形态差异。

Conclusion: DCMIL模型在癌症预后预测中表现出色，具有生成新生物学见解的潜力，所有代码已公开。

Abstract: The burgeoning discipline of computational pathology shows promise in
harnessing whole slide images (WSIs) to quantify morphological heterogeneity
and develop objective prognostic modes for human cancers. However, progress is
impeded by the computational bottleneck of gigapixel-size inputs and the
scarcity of dense manual annotations. Current methods often overlook
fine-grained information across multi-magnification WSIs and variations in
tumor microenvironments. Here, we propose an easy-to-hard progressive
representation learning model, termed dual-curriculum contrastive
multi-instance learning (DCMIL), to efficiently process WSIs for cancer
prognosis. The model does not rely on dense annotations and enables the direct
transformation of gigapixel-size WSIs into outcome predictions. Extensive
experiments on twelve cancer types (5,954 patients, 12.54 million tiles)
demonstrate that DCMIL outperforms standard WSI-based prognostic models.
Additionally, DCMIL identifies fine-grained prognosis-salient regions, provides
robust instance uncertainty estimation, and captures morphological differences
between normal and tumor tissues, with the potential to generate new biological
insights. All codes have been made publicly accessible at

*Hui Xiang,Yifan Bian,Li Li,Jingran Wu,Xianguo Zhang,Dong Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种统一的神经视频压缩框架，结合了帧内和帧间编码，通过自适应编码和双向帧压缩来提升压缩效率和质量稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有神经视频压缩方案在处理遮挡、新内容以及帧间误差传播方面存在不足，需要借鉴传统视频编码中的帧内编码思想来解决这些问题。

Method: 设计了统一的帧内/帧间编码框架，使用单一模型自适应执行两种编码模式，并提出同时压缩两帧的设计来利用前后向帧间冗余。

Result: 相比DCVC-RT平均降低10.7%的BD-rate，提供更稳定的比特率和每帧质量，同时保持实时编码/解码性能。

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了现有神经视频压缩方案的局限性，在压缩效率和稳定性方面均有显著提升。

Abstract: Neural video compression (NVC) technologies have advanced rapidly in recent
years, yielding state-of-the-art schemes such as DCVC-RT that offer superior
compression efficiency to H.266/VVC and real-time encoding/decoding
capabilities. Nonetheless, existing NVC schemes have several limitations,
including inefficiency in dealing with disocclusion and new content, interframe
error propagation and accumulation, among others. To eliminate these
limitations, we borrow the idea from classic video coding schemes, which allow
intra coding within inter-coded frames. With the intra coding tool enabled,
disocclusion and new content are properly handled, and interframe error
propagation is naturally intercepted without the need for manual refresh
mechanisms. We present an NVC framework with unified intra and inter coding,
where every frame is processed by a single model that is trained to perform
intra/inter coding adaptively. Moreover, we propose a simultaneous two-frame
compression design to exploit interframe redundancy not only forwardly but also
backwardly. Experimental results show that our scheme outperforms DCVC-RT by an
average of 10.7\% BD-rate reduction, delivers more stable bitrate and quality
per frame, and retains real-time encoding/decoding performances. Code and
models will be released.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频目标检测在安全关键应用中至关重要，但基于深度学习的检测器容易受到对抗攻击，特别是通用扰动攻击。

Method: 使用核范数正则化促进背景集中的结构化扰动，采用自适应乐观指数梯度方法进行高效优化。

Result: 所提出的攻击在有效性上优于低秩投影梯度下降和Frank-Wolfe攻击，同时保持高隐蔽性。

Conclusion: 该方法为视频目标检测提供了一种高效且隐蔽的通用对抗攻击方案，相关代码和数据已公开。

Abstract: Video-based object detection plays a vital role in safety-critical
applications. While deep learning-based object detectors have achieved
impressive performance, they remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks,
particularly those involving universal perturbations. In this work, we propose
a minimally distorted universal adversarial attack tailored for video object
detection, which leverages nuclear norm regularization to promote structured
perturbations concentrated in the background. To optimize this formulation
efficiently, we employ an adaptive, optimistic exponentiated gradient method
that enhances both scalability and convergence. Our results demonstrate that
the proposed attack outperforms both low-rank projected gradient descent and
Frank-Wolfe based attacks in effectiveness while maintaining high stealthiness.

Abstract: Unsupervised deep generative models are emerging as a promising alternative
to supervised methods for detecting and segmenting anomalies in brain imaging.
Unlike fully supervised approaches, which require large voxel-level annotated
datasets and are limited to well-characterised pathologies, these models can be
trained exclusively on healthy data and identify anomalies as deviations from
learned normative brain structures. This PRISMA-guided scoping review
synthesises recent work on unsupervised deep generative models for anomaly
detection in neuroimaging, including autoencoders, variational autoencoders,
generative adversarial networks, and denoising diffusion models. A total of 49
studies published between 2018 - 2025 were identified, covering applications to
brain MRI and, less frequently, CT across diverse pathologies such as tumours,
stroke, multiple sclerosis, and small vessel disease. Reported performance
metrics are compared alongside architectural design choices. Across the
included studies, generative models achieved encouraging performance for large
focal lesions and demonstrated progress in addressing more subtle
abnormalities. A key strength of generative models is their ability to produce
interpretable pseudo-healthy (also referred to as counterfactual)
reconstructions, which is particularly valuable when annotated data are scarce,
as in rare or heterogeneous diseases. Looking ahead, these models offer a
compelling direction for anomaly detection, enabling semi-supervised learning,
supporting the discovery of novel imaging biomarkers, and facilitating within-
and cross-disease deviation mapping in unified end-to-end frameworks. To
realise clinical impact, future work should prioritise anatomy-aware modelling,
development of foundation models, task-appropriate evaluation metrics, and
rigorous clinical validation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多任务图像恢复模型虽然能同时处理多种图像退化问题，但通常参数过多导致计算效率低下，需要开发压缩策略来提升计算效率。

Method: 使用迭代剪枝策略，通过多轮移除低幅值权重，同时将剩余权重重置为原始初始化，发现能够保持高性能的稀疏子网络。

Result: 在去雨、去雾和去噪任务的基准数据集上，MIR-L模型仅保留10%的可训练参数，同时维持了高水平的图像恢复性能。

Conclusion: 提出的迭代剪枝方法能够有效压缩多任务图像恢复模型，在极高稀疏度下发现性能优异的子网络，为计算效率提升提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Image quality is a critical factor in delivering visually appealing content
on web platforms. However, images often suffer from degradation due to lossy
operations applied by online social networks (OSNs), negatively affecting user
experience. Image restoration is the process of recovering a clean high-quality
image from a given degraded input. Recently, multi-task (all-in-one) image
restoration models have gained significant attention, due to their ability to
simultaneously handle different types of image degradations. However, these
models often come with an excessively high number of trainable parameters,
making them computationally inefficient. In this paper, we propose a strategy
for compressing multi-task image restoration models. We aim to discover highly
sparse subnetworks within overparameterized deep models that can match or even
surpass the performance of their dense counterparts. The proposed model, namely
MIR-L, utilizes an iterative pruning strategy that removes low-magnitude
weights across multiple rounds, while resetting the remaining weights to their
original initialization. This iterative process is important for the multi-task
image restoration model's optimization, effectively uncovering "winning
tickets" that maintain or exceed state-of-the-art performance at high sparsity
levels. Experimental evaluation on benchmark datasets for the deraining,
dehazing, and denoising tasks shows that MIR-L retains only 10% of the
trainable parameters while maintaining high image restoration performance. Our
code, datasets and pre-trained models are made publicly available at

TL;DR: 使用Sentinel-2卫星时间序列数据，通过CNN-LSTM集成模型检测牧场放牧活动，在验证集上平均F1得分为77%，放牧牧场召回率达90%。该模型能有效指导检查资源分配，提高合规性检查效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 放牧活动对农业生产和生物多样性都有重要影响，但目前缺乏可扩展的放牧监测方法。研究旨在利用免费卫星数据开发可靠的放牧检测系统，以支持保护性土地利用的合规性检查。

Method: 基于Sentinel-2 L2A时间序列数据（4-10月），使用CNN-LSTM集成模型对多边形定义的牧场边界进行二元分类（放牧/未放牧），训练多时相反射率特征。

Result: 在五个验证分割上平均F1得分为77%，放牧牧场的召回率达到90%。在操作层面，如果检查员每年最多能访问4%的地点，使用模型预测优先检查未放牧场地，确认的非放牧场地数量比随机检查多17.2倍。

Conclusion: 粗分辨率的免费卫星数据能够可靠地指导检查资源分配，支持保护性土地利用的合规性监测。代码和模型已公开。

Abstract: Grazing shapes both agricultural production and biodiversity, yet scalable
monitoring of where grazing occurs remains limited. We study seasonal grazing
detection from Sentinel-2 L2A time series: for each polygon-defined field
boundary, April-October imagery is used for binary prediction (grazed / not
grazed). We train an ensemble of CNN-LSTM models on multi-temporal reflectance
features, and achieve an average F1 score of 77 percent across five validation
splits, with 90 percent recall on grazed pastures. Operationally, if inspectors
can visit at most 4 percent of sites annually, prioritising fields predicted by
our model as non-grazed yields 17.2 times more confirmed non-grazing sites than
random inspection. These results indicate that coarse-resolution, freely
available satellite data can reliably steer inspection resources for
conservation-aligned land-use compliance. Code and models have been made
publicly available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision Mamba在图像分类中表现出优于Vision Transformers的计算效率（线性vs二次方缩放）和更少的可训练参数，这使其成为三维多孔介质渗透率预测的理想选择。

Method: 使用Vision Mamba作为骨干网络构建神经网络，用于预测三维多孔介质的渗透率，并与ViT和CNN模型进行性能比较，同时进行消融研究评估各组件对准确性的影响。

Result: 在实际应用中验证了Vision Mamba相比ViT和CNN在三维多孔介质渗透率预测中的优势，包括更好的计算效率和内存效率。

Conclusion: 所提出的框架有潜力集成到大型视觉模型中，用Vision Mamba替代ViT，源代码已公开以促进可重复性和进一步研究。

Abstract: Vision Mamba has recently received attention as an alternative to Vision
Transformers (ViTs) for image classification. The network size of Vision Mamba
scales linearly with input image resolution, whereas ViTs scale quadratically,
a feature that improves computational and memory efficiency. Moreover, Vision
Mamba requires a significantly smaller number of trainable parameters than
traditional convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and thus, they can be more
memory efficient. Because of these features, we introduce, for the first time,
a neural network that uses Vision Mamba as its backbone for predicting the
permeability of three-dimensional porous media. We compare the performance of
Vision Mamba with ViT and CNN models across multiple aspects of permeability
prediction and perform an ablation study to assess the effects of its
components on accuracy. We demonstrate in practice the aforementioned
advantages of Vision Mamba over ViTs and CNNs in the permeability prediction of
three-dimensional porous media. We make the source code publicly available to
facilitate reproducibility and to enable other researchers to build on and
extend this work. We believe the proposed framework has the potential to be
integrated into large vision models in which Vision Mamba is used instead of
ViTs.

complications. However, quality control in surgical instrument manufacturing
often relies on manual inspection, which is prone to human error and
inconsistency. This study introduces SurgScan, an AI-powered defect detection
framework for surgical instruments. Using YOLOv8, SurgScan classifies defects
in real-time, ensuring high accuracy and industrial scalability. The model is
trained on a high-resolution dataset of 102,876 images, covering 11 instrument
types and five major defect categories. Extensive evaluation against
state-of-the-art CNN architectures confirms that SurgScan achieves the highest
accuracy (99.3%) with real-time inference speeds of 4.2-5.8 ms per image,
making it suitable for industrial deployment. Statistical analysis demonstrates
that contrast-enhanced preprocessing significantly improves defect detection,
addressing key limitations in visual inspection. SurgScan provides a scalable,
cost-effective AI solution for automated quality control, reducing reliance on
manual inspection while ensuring compliance with ISO 13485 and FDA standards,
paving the way for enhanced defect detection in medical manufacturing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决文本到图像生成中训练-推理不匹配问题：训练时噪声来自提示特定子空间，而推理时来自提示无关的高斯先验，导致图像与提示对齐不佳。

Method: 设计噪声投影器，基于提示嵌入将噪声映射到提示感知版本；使用VLM获取噪声对应图像的token级反馈，蒸馏到奖励模型中，通过准直接偏好优化优化噪声投影器。

Result: 实验表明，提示感知噪声投影能显著改善各种提示下的文本-图像对齐效果。

Conclusion: 提出的噪声投影框架有效解决了训练-推理不匹配问题，无需参考图像或手工先验，推理成本低，能提升文本到图像生成的对齐质量。

Abstract: In text-to-image generation, different initial noises induce distinct
denoising paths with a pretrained Stable Diffusion (SD) model. While this
pattern could output diverse images, some of them may fail to align well with
the prompt. Existing methods alleviate this issue either by altering the
denoising dynamics or by drawing multiple noises and conducting post-selection.
In this paper, we attribute the misalignment to a training-inference mismatch:
during training, prompt-conditioned noises lie in a prompt-specific subset of
the latent space, whereas at inference the noise is drawn from a
prompt-agnostic Gaussian prior. To close this gap, we propose a noise projector
that applies text-conditioned refinement to the initial noise before denoising.
Conditioned on the prompt embedding, it maps the noise to a prompt-aware
counterpart that better matches the distribution observed during SD training,
without modifying the SD model. Our framework consists of these steps: we first
sample some noises and obtain token-level feedback for their corresponding
images from a vision-language model (VLM), then distill these signals into a
reward model, and finally optimize the noise projector via a quasi-direct
preference optimization. Our design has two benefits: (i) it requires no
reference images or handcrafted priors, and (ii) it incurs small inference
cost, replacing multi-sample selection with a single forward pass. Extensive
experiments further show that our prompt-aware noise projection improves
text-image alignment across diverse prompts.

Abstract: Oral and maxillofacial radiology plays a vital role in dental healthcare, but
radiographic image interpretation is limited by a shortage of trained
professionals. While AI approaches have shown promise, existing dental AI
systems are restricted by their single-modality focus, task-specific design,
and reliance on costly labeled data, hindering their generalization across
diverse clinical scenarios. To address these challenges, we introduce DentVFM,
the first family of vision foundation models (VFMs) designed for dentistry.
DentVFM generates task-agnostic visual representations for a wide range of
dental applications and uses self-supervised learning on DentVista, a large
curated dental imaging dataset with approximately 1.6 million multi-modal
radiographic images from various medical centers. DentVFM includes 2D and 3D
variants based on the Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture. To address gaps in
dental intelligence assessment and benchmarks, we introduce DentBench, a
comprehensive benchmark covering eight dental subspecialties, more diseases,
imaging modalities, and a wide geographical distribution. DentVFM shows
impressive generalist intelligence, demonstrating robust generalization to
diverse dental tasks, such as disease diagnosis, treatment analysis, biomarker
identification, and anatomical landmark detection and segmentation.
Experimental results indicate DentVFM significantly outperforms supervised,
self-supervised, and weakly supervised baselines, offering superior
generalization, label efficiency, and scalability. Additionally, DentVFM
enables cross-modality diagnostics, providing more reliable results than
experienced dentists in situations where conventional imaging is unavailable.
DentVFM sets a new paradigm for dental AI, offering a scalable, adaptable, and
label-efficient model to improve intelligent dental healthcare and address
critical gaps in global oral healthcare.

*Chenyuan Qu,Hao Chen,Jianbo Jiao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VisualSplit框架通过将图像分解为解耦的经典视觉描述符（如边缘、颜色、强度分布），让现代学习从经典视觉线索中受益，保持可解释性的同时提升视觉理解能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习在图像理解方面取得了显著进展，但其内部表示往往不透明，难以解释视觉信息处理过程。相比之下，经典视觉描述符对人类来说直观易懂。现代学习能否从这些经典线索中受益？

Method: 提出VisualSplit框架，将图像显式分解为解耦的经典描述符，每个描述符作为视觉知识的独立但互补组件。通过重建驱动的预训练方案，学习捕捉每个视觉描述符的本质同时保持可解释性。

Result: 通过显式分解视觉属性，该方法在图像生成和编辑等高级视觉任务中促进了有效的属性控制，超越了传统的分类和分割任务。

Conclusion: 这种新的学习方法在视觉理解方面表现出有效性，为现代学习与经典视觉线索的结合提供了可行路径。

Abstract: Exploring and understanding efficient image representations is a
long-standing challenge in computer vision. While deep learning has achieved
remarkable progress across image understanding tasks, its internal
representations are often opaque, making it difficult to interpret how visual
information is processed. In contrast, classical visual descriptors (e.g. edge,
colour, and intensity distribution) have long been fundamental to image
analysis and remain intuitively understandable to humans. Motivated by this
gap, we ask a central question: Can modern learning benefit from these
classical cues? In this paper, we answer it with VisualSplit, a framework that
explicitly decomposes images into decoupled classical descriptors, treating
each as an independent but complementary component of visual knowledge. Through
a reconstruction-driven pre-training scheme, VisualSplit learns to capture the
essence of each visual descriptor while preserving their interpretability. By
explicitly decomposing visual attributes, our method inherently facilitates
effective attribute control in various advanced visual tasks, including image
generation and editing, extending beyond conventional classification and
segmentation, suggesting the effectiveness of this new learning approach for
visual understanding. Project page: https://chenyuanqu.com/VisualSplit/.

TL;DR: 提出Flow Matching Alignment (FMA)方法，通过多步调整实现跨模态特征对齐，相比传统单步PEFT方法在复杂数据集上表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有参数高效微调方法只能进行单步调整，对于特征高度纠缠的复杂数据集不够充分，需要更精确的跨模态对齐能力。

Method: 学习跨模态速度场，使用固定耦合策略确保类别对应，采用噪声增强缓解数据稀缺问题，设计早停求解器提高效率和精度。

Result: 在多个基准测试和骨干网络上均取得显著性能提升，特别是在具有挑战性的数据集上表现突出。

Conclusion: FMA通过多步校正能力实现了更精确和鲁棒的跨模态对齐，优于传统的单步PEFT方法。

Abstract: Aligning features from different modalities, is one of the most fundamental
challenges for cross-modal tasks. Although pre-trained vision-language models
can achieve a general alignment between image and text, they often require
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) for further adjustment. Today's PEFT
methods (e.g., prompt tuning, LoRA-based, or adapter-based) always selectively
fine-tune a subset of parameters, which can slightly adjust either visual or
textual features, and avoid overfitting. In this paper, we are the first to
highlight that all existing PEFT methods perform one-step adjustment. It is
insufficient for complex (or difficult) datasets, where features of different
modalities are highly entangled. To this end, we propose the first
model-agnostic multi-step adjustment approach by learning a cross-modal
velocity field: Flow Matching Alignment (FMA). Specifically, to ensure the
correspondence between categories during training, we first utilize a fixed
coupling strategy. Then, we propose a noise augmentation strategy to alleviate
the data scarcity issue. Finally, we design an early-stopping solver, which
terminates the transformation process earlier, improving both efficiency and
accuracy. Compared with one-step PEFT methods, FMA has the multi-step
rectification ability to achieve more precise and robust alignment. Extensive
results have demonstrated that FMA can consistently yield significant
performance gains across various benchmarks and backbones, particularly on
challenging datasets.

TL;DR: 提出一种训练自由的提示嵌入编辑方法SDeC，通过抑制场景与身份的自然关联来解决文本到图像生成中的身份漂移问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决文本到图像生成中的身份漂移问题，特别是当目标场景未知时的挑战。

Method: 提出场景去上下文化(SDeC)方法，通过量化SVD方向稳定性来自适应重加权特征值，抑制身份提示嵌入中的潜在场景-身份关联。

Result: 实验表明SDeC显著增强了身份保持能力，同时保持了场景多样性。

Conclusion: SDeC提供了一种高效、训练自由的解决方案，适用于现实世界应用，无需预先知道所有目标场景。

Abstract: Consistent text-to-image (T2I) generation seeks to produce
identity-preserving images of the same subject across diverse scenes, yet it
often fails due to a phenomenon called identity (ID) shift. Previous methods
have tackled this issue, but typically rely on the unrealistic assumption of
knowing all target scenes in advance. This paper reveals that a key source of
ID shift is the native correlation between subject and scene context, called
scene contextualization, which arises naturally as T2I models fit the training
distribution of vast natural images. We formally prove the near-universality of
this scene-ID correlation and derive theoretical bounds on its strength. On
this basis, we propose a novel, efficient, training-free prompt embedding
editing approach, called Scene De-Contextualization (SDeC), that imposes an
inversion process of T2I's built-in scene contextualization. Specifically, it
identifies and suppresses the latent scene-ID correlation within the ID
prompt's embedding by quantifying the SVD directional stability to adaptively
re-weight the corresponding eigenvalues. Critically, SDeC allows for per-scene
use (one scene per prompt) without requiring prior access to all target scenes.
This makes it a highly flexible and general solution well-suited to real-world
applications where such prior knowledge is often unavailable or varies over
time. Experiments demonstrate that SDeC significantly enhances identity
preservation while maintaining scene diversity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统3D高斯泼溅训练存在三个关键低效问题：高斯密度分配不均、计算工作负载不平衡和内存访问碎片化，这些问题限制了训练效率。

Method: 1) 算法层面：启发式工作负载敏感高斯密度控制，平衡点分布；2) 系统层面：基于相似性的高斯采样和合并，动态分配工作负载；3) 映射层面：基于重排序的内存访问映射策略，优化RGB存储结构。

Result: 在NVIDIA A100 GPU上相比3DGS实现了1.44倍的训练加速，且质量下降可忽略不计。

Conclusion: BalanceGS通过算法-系统协同设计有效解决了3D高斯泼溅训练中的效率瓶颈，为高质量3D重建提供了高效的训练方案。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a promising 3D reconstruction
technique. The traditional 3DGS training pipeline follows three sequential
steps: Gaussian densification, Gaussian projection, and color splatting.
Despite its promising reconstruction quality, this conventional approach
suffers from three critical inefficiencies: (1) Skewed density allocation
during Gaussian densification, (2) Imbalanced computation workload during
Gaussian projection and (3) Fragmented memory access during color splatting.
  To tackle the above challenges, we introduce BalanceGS, the algorithm-system
co-design for efficient training in 3DGS. (1) At the algorithm level, we
propose heuristic workload-sensitive Gaussian density control to automatically
balance point distributions - removing 80% redundant Gaussians in dense regions
while filling gaps in sparse areas. (2) At the system level, we propose
Similarity-based Gaussian sampling and merging, which replaces the static
one-to-one thread-pixel mapping with adaptive workload distribution - threads
now dynamically process variable numbers of Gaussians based on local cluster
density. (3) At the mapping level, we propose reordering-based memory access
mapping strategy that restructures RGB storage and enables batch loading in
shared memory.
  Extensive experiments demonstrate that compared with 3DGS, our approach
achieves a 1.44$\times$ training speedup on a NVIDIA A100 GPU with negligible
quality degradation.

Abstract: This paper presents CALM-Net, a curvature-aware LiDAR point cloud-based
multi-branch neural network for vehicle re-identification. The proposed model
addresses the challenge of learning discriminative and complementary features
from three-dimensional point clouds to distinguish between vehicles. CALM-Net
employs a multi-branch architecture that integrates edge convolution, point
attention, and a curvature embedding that characterizes local surface variation
in point clouds. By combining these mechanisms, the model learns richer
geometric and contextual features that are well suited for the
re-identification task. Experimental evaluation on the large-scale nuScenes
dataset demonstrates that CALM-Net achieves a mean re-identification accuracy
improvement of approximately 1.97\% points compared with the strongest baseline
in our study. The results confirms the effectiveness of incorporating curvature
information into deep learning architectures and highlight the benefit of
multi-branch feature learning for LiDAR point cloud-based vehicle
re-identification.

Conclusion: 该双向框架为关键点引导的图像理解和语言引导的精确定位开辟了新的应用前景

Abstract: Vision-language models have achieved remarkable success in cross-modal
understanding. Yet, these models remain limited to object-level or region-level
grounding, lacking the capability for pixel-precise keypoint comprehension
through natural language. We introduce a novel framework for pixel level
grounding. The framework consists of two complementary components: a Point
Descriptor that generates rich, contextual descriptions of individual
keypoints, and a Point Localizer that regresses precise pixel coordinates from
these descriptions. Unlike prior work that relies on templated prompts or
keypoint names, our approach produces free-form, coarse-to-fine descriptions
that situate keypoints within their visual context. Since there is no available
dataset to train such a system, we introduce LlamaPointInPart, a carefully
curated dataset of 20K+ image-keypoint-description triplets synthesized from
multiple vision-language models, capturing multi-scale information from
scene-level context to visual features around the keypoint. For cross-category
generalization, we optimize the Point Descriptor on AP-10K via GRPO, using the
frozen Point Localizer as a reward model to produce descriptions that maximize
localization accuracy. To evaluate our results we establish a new evaluation
protocol. Instead of comparing the text description produced by our method to
the ground truth, we use the localizer to determine how close is the predicted
point generated to the ground truth point. Experiments demonstrate superior
performance compared to baseline models on LlamaPointInPart.The bidirectional
nature of our framework should enable future applications in both
keypoint-guided image understanding and language-guided precise localization.
Our code and dataset are publicly available at

TL;DR: STANCE是一个图像到视频生成框架，通过实例线索和密集RoPE解决运动一致性问题，无需逐帧轨迹脚本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视频生成在保持连贯物体运动和交互方面存在困难，主要瓶颈包括：人类提供的运动提示在编码后有效token过少，以及单头优化中纹理优先于时间一致性。

Method: 引入实例线索——将稀疏用户可编辑提示转换为密集2.5D运动场；使用密集RoPE在token空间中保持线索显著性；结合RGB+辅助图预测来分离结构和外观处理。

Result: 该方法减少了深度模糊性，稳定了优化过程，提高了时间一致性。

Conclusion: STANCE框架有效解决了视频生成中的运动一致性问题，通过简单的组件实现了更好的物体运动控制。

Abstract: Video generation has recently made striking visual progress, but maintaining
coherent object motion and interactions remains difficult. We trace two
practical bottlenecks: (i) human-provided motion hints (e.g., small 2D maps)
often collapse to too few effective tokens after encoding, weakening guidance;
and (ii) optimizing for appearance and motion in a single head can favor
texture over temporal consistency. We present STANCE, an image-to-video
framework that addresses both issues with two simple components. First, we
introduce Instance Cues -- a pixel-aligned control signal that turns sparse,
user-editable hints into a dense 2.5D (camera-relative) motion field by
averaging per-instance flow and augmenting with monocular depth over the
instance mask. This reduces depth ambiguity compared to 2D arrow inputs while
remaining easy to use. Second, we preserve the salience of these cues in token
space with Dense RoPE, which tags a small set of motion tokens (anchored on the
first frame) with spatial-addressable rotary embeddings. Paired with joint RGB
\(+\) auxiliary-map prediction (segmentation or depth), our model anchors
structure while RGB handles appearance, stabilizing optimization and improving
temporal coherence without requiring per-frame trajectory scripts.

Conclusion: Wiki-PRF方法通过三阶段处理和强化学习训练，显著提升了KB-VQA任务的性能，证明了多模态查询优化和检索结果过滤的有效性。

Abstract: Knowledge-based visual question answering (KB-VQA) requires visual language
models (VLMs) to integrate visual understanding with external knowledge
retrieval. Although retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) achieves significant
advances in this task by combining knowledge-base querying, it still struggles
with the quality of multimodal queries and the relevance of retrieved results.
To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel three-stage method, termed
Wiki-PRF, including Processing, Retrieval and Filtering stages. The processing
stage dynamically invokes visual tools to extract precise multimodal
information for retrieval. The retrieval stage integrates visual and text
features to achieve multimodal knowledge retrieval. The filtering stage
performs relevance filtering and concentration on retrieval results. To this
end, we introduce a visual language model trained with answer accuracy and
format consistency as reward signals via a reinforcement learning manner. This
enhances the model's reasoning, tool invocation for accurate queries, and
filtering of irrelevant content. Experiments on benchmark datasets (E-VQA and
InfoSeek) show significant improvements~(36.0 and 42.8) in answer quality,
achieving state-of-the-art performance. Code is available at

Conclusion: 提出的Shot2Tactic-Caption框架能够有效生成羽毛球视频的多尺度字幕，捕捉从击球级到战术级的语义信息，为战术理解提供新方法。

Abstract: Tactical understanding in badminton involves interpreting not only individual
actions but also how tactics are dynamically executed over time. In this paper,
we propose \textbf{Shot2Tactic-Caption}, a novel framework for semantic and
temporal multi-scale video captioning in badminton, capable of generating
shot-level captions that describe individual actions and tactic-level captions
that capture how these actions unfold over time within a tactical execution. We
also introduce the Shot2Tactic-Caption Dataset, the first badminton captioning
dataset containing 5,494 shot captions and 544 tactic captions.
Shot2Tactic-Caption adopts a dual-branch design, with both branches including a
visual encoder, a spatio-temporal Transformer encoder, and a Transformer-based
decoder to generate shot and tactic captions. To support tactic captioning, we
additionally introduce a Tactic Unit Detector that identifies valid tactic
units, tactic types, and tactic states (e.g., Interrupt, Resume). For tactic
captioning, we further incorporate a shot-wise prompt-guided mechanism, where
the predicted tactic type and state are embedded as prompts and injected into
the decoder via cross-attention. The shot-wise prompt-guided mechanism enables
our system not only to describe successfully executed tactics but also to
capture tactical executions that are temporarily interrupted and later resumed.
Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in
generating both shot and tactic captions. Ablation studies show that the
ResNet50-based spatio-temporal encoder outperforms other variants, and that
shot-wise prompt structuring leads to more coherent and accurate tactic
captioning.

Result: EVS将大型语言模型的首令牌时间(TTFT)减少高达4倍，精度损失最小。结合随机剪枝率的上训练阶段，EVS产生对变化压缩级别具有鲁棒性的模型，在激进剪枝下保持完整性能。

Conclusion: EVS持续改进效率-精度权衡，在不牺牲质量的情况下解锁可扩展的视频语言理解。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have recently expanded from static image
understanding to video reasoning, but their scalability is fundamentally
limited by the quadratic cost of processing dense frame sequences. Long videos
often exceed the token budget of modern language models, leading to severe
context limitations and latency issues. We introduce Efficient Video Sampling
(EVS), a simple, plug-and-play method for reducing token redundancy in videos
by identifying and pruning temporally static patches -- spatial regions that
remain unchanged across consecutive frames. EVS preserves positional identity,
requires no architectural changes or retraining. We show that EVS substantially
reduces token count while maintaining semantic fidelity, enabling faster
inference and longer input sequences. Applied at inference time, EVS reduces
large language model (LLM) time-to-first-token (TTFT) by up to 4x with minimal
accuracy loss. When combined with an uptraining phase using stochastic pruning
rates, EVS yields models that are robust to varying compression levels and
retain full performance under aggressive pruning. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that EVS consistently improves efficiency-accuracy trade-offs,
unlocking scalable video-language understanding without sacrificing quality.

*Ming Gui,Johannes Schusterbauer,Timy Phan,Felix Krause,Josh Susskind,Miguel Angel Bautista,Björn Ommer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RepTok是一个生成建模框架，使用自监督视觉变换器生成的单个连续潜在令牌来表示图像，通过微调语义令牌嵌入和生成解码器实现高效图像生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决2D潜在空间的空间冗余问题，降低训练成本，同时利用自监督学习表示作为紧凑有效的潜在空间进行生成建模。

Method: 基于预训练的SSL编码器，仅微调语义令牌嵌入，配合使用标准流匹配目标训练的生成解码器，添加余弦相似度损失来正则化适应后的令牌。

Result: 在类别条件ImageNet生成上取得竞争性结果，在MS-COCO上以极有限的训练预算达到竞争性零样本性能。

Conclusion: 微调后的SSL表示可以作为紧凑有效的潜在空间，用于高效的生成建模。

Abstract: We introduce Representation Tokenizer (RepTok), a generative modeling
framework that represents an image using a single continuous latent token
obtained from self-supervised vision transformers. Building on a pre-trained
SSL encoder, we fine-tune only the semantic token embedding and pair it with a
generative decoder trained jointly using a standard flow matching objective.
This adaptation enriches the token with low-level, reconstruction-relevant
details, enabling faithful image reconstruction. To preserve the favorable
geometry of the original SSL space, we add a cosine-similarity loss that
regularizes the adapted token, ensuring the latent space remains smooth and
suitable for generation. Our single-token formulation resolves spatial
redundancies of 2D latent spaces and significantly reduces training costs.
Despite its simplicity and efficiency, RepTok achieves competitive results on
class-conditional ImageNet generation and naturally extends to text-to-image
synthesis, reaching competitive zero-shot performance on MS-COCO under
extremely limited training budgets. Our findings highlight the potential of
fine-tuned SSL representations as compact and effective latent spaces for
efficient generative modeling.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SteeringTTA是一个基于Feynman-Kac引导的测试时自适应框架，通过扩散模型引导输入适应，无需模型更新或源数据，在ImageNet-C上表现优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有基于扩散的测试时自适应方法依赖梯度引导，限制了跨失真类型探索和泛化能力的问题。

Method: 采用Feynman-Kac引导机制，维护多个粒子轨迹，通过累积top-K概率和熵调度来平衡探索和置信度，使用伪标签驱动的奖励进行扩散输入适应。

Result: 在ImageNet-C数据集上，SteeringTTA始终优于不进行任何模型更新或使用源数据的基线方法。

Conclusion: SteeringTTA框架有效提升了模型在分布偏移下的鲁棒性，无需模型更新即可实现优异的测试时自适应性能。

Abstract: Test-time adaptation (TTA) aims to correct performance degradation of deep
models under distribution shifts by updating models or inputs using unlabeled
test data. Input-only diffusion-based TTA methods improve robustness for
classification to corruptions but rely on gradient guidance, limiting
exploration and generalization across distortion types. We propose SteeringTTA,
an inference-only framework that adapts Feynman-Kac steering to guide
diffusion-based input adaptation for classification with rewards driven by
pseudo-label. SteeringTTA maintains multiple particle trajectories, steered by
a combination of cumulative top-K probabilities and an entropy schedule, to
balance exploration and confidence. On ImageNet-C, SteeringTTA consistently
outperforms the baseline without any model updates or source data.

TL;DR: 提出了一种低成本预训练策略，利用非配对视频剪辑进行上下文学习，用于基于指令的视频编辑，显著提升了指令对齐和视觉保真度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于指令的图像编辑发展迅速，但扩展到视频领域仍面临挑战，主要由于构建大规模配对视频编辑数据集的成本高昂且复杂。

Method: 采用两阶段训练：首先在约100万真实视频剪辑上进行预训练学习基本编辑概念，然后在少于15万精选编辑对上进行微调以扩展编辑任务并提升编辑质量。

Result: 实验表明该方法在指令对齐和视觉保真度方面均优于现有基于指令的视频编辑方法，编辑指令遵循度提升12%，编辑质量提升15%。

Conclusion: 所提出的低成本预训练策略有效解决了视频编辑数据稀缺问题，为基于指令的视频编辑提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Despite the rapid progress of instruction-based image editing, its extension
to video remains underexplored, primarily due to the prohibitive cost and
complexity of constructing large-scale paired video editing datasets. To
address this challenge, we introduce a low-cost pretraining strategy for
instruction-based video editing that leverages in-context learning from
unpaired video clips. We show that pretraining a foundation video generation
model with this strategy endows it with general editing capabilities, such as
adding, replacing, or deleting operations, according to input editing
instructions. The pretrained model can then be efficiently refined with a small
amount of high-quality paired editing data. Built upon HunyuanVideoT2V, our
framework first pretrains on approximately 1M real video clips to learn basic
editing concepts, and subsequently fine-tunes on fewer than 150k curated
editing pairs to extend more editing tasks and improve the editing quality.
Comparative experiments show that our method surpasses existing
instruction-based video editing approaches in both instruction alignment and
visual fidelity, achieving a 12\% improvement in editing instruction following
and a 15\% improvement in editing quality.

TL;DR: 将去相关反向传播(DBP)集成到MAE预训练中，通过减少输入相关性来加速收敛，在保持性能的同时显著降低计算成本和碳排放。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MAE预训练在低标签场景下表现优异，但计算成本高昂，难以在工业场景中实用。需要找到既能保持性能又能降低计算开销的方法。

Method: 在MAE预训练的编码器中选择性应用DBP优化方法，通过迭代减少各层输入相关性来加速收敛过程。

Result: 在ImageNet-1K预训练和ADE20K微调中，DBP-MAE将训练时间减少21.1%，碳排放降低21.4%，分割mIoU提升1.1个百分点。在工业数据上也观察到类似收益。

Conclusion: DBP能够在大规模ViT预训练中同时减少训练时间、能源消耗，并提升下游任务性能，具有实际工业应用价值。

Abstract: Masked Autoencoder (MAE) pre-training of vision transformers (ViTs) yields
strong performance in low-label regimes but comes with substantial
computational costs, making it impractical in time- and resource-constrained
industrial settings. We address this by integrating Decorrelated
Backpropagation (DBP) into MAE pre-training, an optimization method that
iteratively reduces input correlations at each layer to accelerate convergence.
Applied selectively to the encoder, DBP achieves faster pre-training without
loss of stability. On ImageNet-1K pre-training with ADE20K fine-tuning, DBP-MAE
reduces wall-clock time to baseline performance by 21.1%, lowers carbon
emissions by 21.4% and improves segmentation mIoU by 1.1 points. We observe
similar gains when pre-training and fine-tuning on proprietary industrial data,
confirming the method's applicability in real-world scenarios. These results
demonstrate that DBP can reduce training time and energy use while improving
downstream performance for large-scale ViT pre-training.

TL;DR: EuroMineNet是首个基于Sentinel-2多光谱影像的采矿足迹制图和监测综合多时间基准数据集，涵盖欧盟133个采矿点2015-2024年的年度观测和专家验证标注，支持可持续性驱动的采矿足迹制图和跨时间变化检测任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 采矿活动是环境退化的主要来源，但现有数据集在时间深度或地理范围上有限，需要长期一致的采矿诱发地表变化监测来支持可持续资源管理和环境治理。

Method: 基于Sentinel-2多光谱影像构建EuroMineNet数据集，支持两个任务：(1)多时间采矿足迹制图，使用新颖的Change-Aware Temporal IoU指标评估；(2)跨时间变化检测以捕捉渐进和突变的地表变化。对20个最先进的深度学习模型进行基准测试。

Result: 基准测试显示GeoAI方法能有效识别长期环境变化，但在检测对及时缓解至关重要的短期动态方面仍面临挑战。

Conclusion: EuroMineNet通过推进时间一致且可解释的采矿监测，有助于可持续土地利用管理、环境韧性，以及应用GeoAI实现社会和环境的更广泛目标。数据集和代码遵循FAIR原则和开放科学范式发布。

Abstract: Mining activities are essential for industrial and economic development, but
remain a leading source of environmental degradation, contributing to
deforestation, soil erosion, and water contamination. Sustainable resource
management and environmental governance require consistent, long-term
monitoring of mining-induced land surface changes, yet existing datasets are
often limited in temporal depth or geographic scope. To address this gap, we
present EuroMineNet, the first comprehensive multitemporal benchmark for mining
footprint mapping and monitoring based on Sentinel-2 multispectral imagery.
Spanning 133 mining sites across the European Union, EuroMineNet provides
annual observations and expert-verified annotations from 2015 to 2024, enabling
GeoAI-based models to analyze environmental dynamics at a continental scale. It
supports two sustainability-driven tasks: (1) multitemporal mining footprint
mapping for consistent annual land-use delineation, evaluated with a novel
Change-Aware Temporal IoU (CA-TIoU) metric, and (2) cross-temporal change
detection to capture both gradual and abrupt surface transformations.
Benchmarking 20 state-of-the-art deep learning models reveals that while GeoAI
methods effectively identify long-term environmental changes, challenges remain
in detecting short-term dynamics critical for timely mitigation. By advancing
temporally consistent and explainable mining monitoring, EuroMineNet
contributes to sustainable land-use management, environmental resilience, and
the broader goal of applying GeoAI for social and environmental good. We
release the codes and datasets by aligning with FAIR and the open science
paradigm at https://github.com/EricYu97/EuroMineNet.

TL;DR: 提出了WeCKD方法，通过链式知识蒸馏结构实现渐进式知识传递，解决了传统知识蒸馏中的知识退化、监督效率低和数据依赖性强等问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统知识蒸馏依赖强大的教师模型或大量标注数据，在现实世界有限数据场景下效果受限，存在知识退化、监督效率低等问题。

Method: 构建弱监督链式知识蒸馏网络，形成渐进式蒸馏链，每个模型不仅从前驱学习知识，还进行知识精炼后传递给后续模型，每个模型仅使用部分数据集训练。

Result: 在四个耳镜成像数据集上超越现有监督方法，在两个其他数据集上验证了在显微和磁共振成像等医学影像模态的泛化能力，相比单骨干网络在有限数据下准确率提升高达23%。

Conclusion: WeCKD通过链式知识蒸馏结构有效提升了有限数据场景下的学习效果，具有现实应用潜力。

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) has traditionally relied on a static
teacher-student framework, where a large, well-trained teacher transfers
knowledge to a single student model. However, these approaches often suffer
from knowledge degradation, inefficient supervision, and reliance on either a
very strong teacher model or large labeled datasets, which limits their
effectiveness in real-world, limited-data scenarios. To address these, we
present the first-ever Weakly-supervised Chain-based KD network (WeCKD) that
redefines knowledge transfer through a structured sequence of interconnected
models. Unlike conventional KD, it forms a progressive distillation chain,
where each model not only learns from its predecessor but also refines the
knowledge before passing it forward. This structured knowledge transfer further
enhances feature learning, reduces data dependency, and mitigates the
limitations of one-step KD. Each model in the distillation chain is trained on
only a fraction of the dataset and demonstrates that effective learning can be
achieved with minimal supervision. Extensive evaluations across four otoscopic
imaging datasets demonstrate that it not only matches but in many cases
surpasses the performance of existing supervised methods. Experimental results
on two other datasets further underscore its generalization across diverse
medical imaging modalities, including microscopic and magnetic resonance
imaging. Furthermore, our evaluations resulted in cumulative accuracy gains of
up to +23% over a single backbone trained on the same limited data, which
highlights its potential for real-world adoption.

Method: 提出VTimeCoT框架，包含两个新颖的进度条视觉工具（即插即用进度条集成工具和高效高亮工具），并引入视觉时序思维链过程，实现视频和文本的跨模态推理。

Result: 在Qwen2VL-7B和GPT4o基线模型上，视频时序定位和推理问答任务均取得显著性能提升。

Conclusion: 该框架实现了组合性和可解释的推理过程，为视频理解系统提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: In recent years, video question answering based on multimodal large language
models (MLLM) has garnered considerable attention, due to the benefits from the
substantial advancements in LLMs. However, these models have a notable
deficiency in the domains of video temporal grounding and reasoning, posing
challenges to the development of effective real-world video understanding
systems. Inspired by how humans use video players to interact with the progress
bar for video comprehension, we introduce VTimeCoT, a simple yet effective
training-free framework, designed for high-performance video grounding and
reasoning. The proposed framework incorporates two novel visual tools of the
progress bar: a plug-and-play progress bar integration tool and a
high-efficiency highlighting tool. In addition, to address the limitations of
conventional text-based chain-of-thought (CoT) approaches, we introduce a
visuotemporal CoT process that integrates cross-modality reasoning across both
video and text. Our approach demonstrates significant performance improvements
on both Qwen2VL-7B and GPT4o baselines in tasks of video temporal grounding and
reasoning-based question answering. Finally, we showcase that the proposed
framework achieves a compositional and interpretable reasoning process. Project

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于学习图像先验的3D高斯泼溅压缩框架，通过恢复网络建模压缩伪影，结合粗渲染残差作为辅助信息，在保持高渲染质量的同时实现更高效的存储压缩。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的3D高斯泼溅压缩技术虽然显著减少了存储开销，但缺乏学习先验限制了率失真性能的进一步提升。需要利用学习图像先验的能力来恢复压缩引起的质量下降。

Method: 在初始压缩的高斯基础上，构建恢复网络来建模压缩高斯与原始高斯之间的图像空间伪影。引入粗渲染残差作为辅助信息提升率失真性能，通过恢复图像的监督来优化压缩高斯表示。

Result: 实验验证了框架的有效性，在率失真性能上表现优越，渲染质量超过最先进的3DGS压缩方法，同时需要显著更少的存储空间。

Conclusion: 该框架兼容现有的高斯压缩方法，能够实现高度紧凑的表示并增强渲染性能，为3DGS压缩提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Compression techniques for 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have recently
achieved considerable success in minimizing storage overhead for 3D Gaussians
while preserving high rendering quality. Despite the impressive storage
reduction, the lack of learned priors restricts further advances in the
rate-distortion trade-off for 3DGS compression tasks. To address this, we
introduce a novel 3DGS compression framework that leverages the powerful
representational capacity of learned image priors to recover
compression-induced quality degradation. Built upon initially compressed
Gaussians, our restoration network effectively models the compression artifacts
in the image space between degraded and original Gaussians. To enhance the
rate-distortion performance, we provide coarse rendering residuals into the
restoration network as side information. By leveraging the supervision of
restored images, the compressed Gaussians are refined, resulting in a highly
compact representation with enhanced rendering performance. Our framework is
designed to be compatible with existing Gaussian compression methods, making it
broadly applicable across different baselines. Extensive experiments validate
the effectiveness of our framework, demonstrating superior rate-distortion
performance and outperforming the rendering quality of state-of-the-art 3DGS
compression methods while requiring substantially less storage.

Motivation: 传统鲸鱼种群监测方法昂贵且难以扩展，而现有基于VHR卫星图像的自动检测方法面临标注数据缺乏、图像质量变化和环境条件差异等挑战。

Method: 使用统计异常检测方法识别空间异常点（"有趣点"），结合基于web的标注界面让专家快速标注这些点，不依赖标注训练数据。

Conclusion: 该方法为未来机器辅助的海洋哺乳动物空间监测提供了可扩展的第一步，不依赖标注训练数据，已开源相关代码。

Abstract: Effective monitoring of whale populations is critical for conservation, but
traditional survey methods are expensive and difficult to scale. While prior
work has shown that whales can be identified in very high-resolution (VHR)
satellite imagery, large-scale automated detection remains challenging due to a
lack of annotated imagery, variability in image quality and environmental
conditions, and the cost of building robust machine learning pipelines over
massive remote sensing archives. We present a semi-automated approach for
surfacing possible whale detections in VHR imagery using a statistical anomaly
detection method that flags spatial outliers, i.e. "interesting points". We
pair this detector with a web-based labeling interface designed to enable
experts to quickly annotate the interesting points. We evaluate our system on
three benchmark scenes with known whale annotations and achieve recalls of
90.3% to 96.4%, while reducing the area requiring expert inspection by up to
99.8% -- from over 1,000 sq km to less than 2 sq km in some cases. Our method
does not rely on labeled training data and offers a scalable first step toward
future machine-assisted marine mammal monitoring from space. We have open

Motivation: 现有注意力机制大多局限于单层或双层特征优化，忽略了多尺度表示间的丰富跨层依赖关系，限制了检测大尺度变化目标的能力。

Method: CFSAM包含三个核心组件：卷积局部特征提取器、基于Transformer的全局建模单元（高效捕获跨层交互）、特征融合机制（恢复和增强原始表示）。

Result: 在SSD300框架中集成CFSAM后，PASCAL VOC数据集mAP从75.5%提升至78.6%，COCO数据集从43.1%提升至52.1%，超越了现有注意力模块，同时加速训练收敛且未引入显著计算开销。

Conclusion: 显式跨层注意力建模对推进多尺度目标检测具有重要意义。

Abstract: Recent object detection methods have made remarkable progress by leveraging
attention mechanisms to improve feature discriminability. However, most
existing approaches are confined to refining single-layer or fusing dual-layer
features, overlooking the rich inter-layer dependencies across multi-scale
representations. This limits their ability to capture comprehensive contextual
information essential for detecting objects with large scale variations. In
this paper, we propose a novel Cross-Layer Feature Self-Attention Module
(CFSAM), which holistically models both local and global dependencies within
multi-scale feature maps. CFSAM consists of three key components: a
convolutional local feature extractor, a Transformer-based global modeling unit
that efficiently captures cross-layer interactions, and a feature fusion
mechanism to restore and enhance the original representations. When integrated
into the SSD300 framework, CFSAM significantly boosts detection performance,
achieving 78.6% mAP on PASCAL VOC (vs. 75.5% baseline) and 52.1% mAP on COCO
(vs. 43.1% baseline), outperforming existing attention modules. Moreover, the
module accelerates convergence during training without introducing substantial
computational overhead. Our work highlights the importance of explicit
cross-layer attention modeling in advancing multi-scale object detection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的图像标注通常具有不同的粒度（如鸟类→秃鹰），但现有方法假设完整的细粒度标注，这在实际中很少满足。需要处理混合粒度的监督信号。

Method: 使用CLIP模拟语义模糊性，创建混合粒度标签；提出free-grain学习框架，结合视觉语言模型生成的伪属性和半监督学习来增强语义和视觉指导。

Result: 提出的方法和强基线在混合监督下显著提升了性能，验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: ImageNet-F基准和free-grain学习方法推进了在现实约束下的层次分类研究，能够更好地处理粒度不一的标注数据。

Abstract: Hierarchical image classification predicts labels across a semantic taxonomy,
but existing methods typically assume complete, fine-grained annotations, an
assumption rarely met in practice. Real-world supervision varies in
granularity, influenced by image quality, annotator expertise, and task
demands; a distant bird may be labeled Bird, while a close-up reveals Bald
eagle. We introduce ImageNet-F, a large-scale benchmark curated from ImageNet
and structured into cognitively inspired basic, subordinate, and fine-grained
levels. Using CLIP as a proxy for semantic ambiguity, we simulate realistic,
mixed-granularity labels reflecting human annotation behavior. We propose
free-grain learning, with heterogeneous supervision across instances. We
develop methods that enhance semantic guidance via pseudo-attributes from
vision-language models and visual guidance via semi-supervised learning. These,
along with strong baselines, substantially improve performance under mixed
supervision. Together, our benchmark and methods advance hierarchical
classification under real-world constraints.

TL;DR: DEXTER是一个无需数据的框架，利用扩散模型和大型语言模型为视觉分类器生成全局文本解释，通过优化文本提示合成激活目标分类器的类条件图像，然后生成详细的语言报告来描述类特定决策模式和偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解和解释机器学习模型的行为对于构建透明可信的AI系统至关重要，需要在不依赖训练数据或真实标签的情况下生成自然语言解释。

Method: 通过优化文本提示合成类条件图像来强烈激活目标分类器，然后使用这些合成样本来生成详细的语言报告，描述类特定决策模式和偏见。

Result: 在ImageNet、Waterbirds、CelebA和FairFaces上的实验表明，DEXTER在全局模型解释和类级偏见报告方面优于现有方法，定量和定性评估（包括用户研究）显示其产生准确、可解释的输出。

Conclusion: DEXTER展示了在不访问训练数据或真实标签的情况下，通过扩散模型和语言模型生成视觉分类器自然语言解释的可行性，在激活最大化、切片发现与去偏见、偏见解释等任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Understanding and explaining the behavior of machine learning models is
essential for building transparent and trustworthy AI systems. We introduce
DEXTER, a data-free framework that employs diffusion models and large language
models to generate global, textual explanations of visual classifiers. DEXTER
operates by optimizing text prompts to synthesize class-conditional images that
strongly activate a target classifier. These synthetic samples are then used to
elicit detailed natural language reports that describe class-specific decision
patterns and biases. Unlike prior work, DEXTER enables natural language
explanation about a classifier's decision process without access to training
data or ground-truth labels. We demonstrate DEXTER's flexibility across three
tasks-activation maximization, slice discovery and debiasing, and bias
explanation-each illustrating its ability to uncover the internal mechanisms of
visual classifiers. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations, including a user
study, show that DEXTER produces accurate, interpretable outputs. Experiments
on ImageNet, Waterbirds, CelebA, and FairFaces confirm that DEXTER outperforms
existing approaches in global model explanation and class-level bias reporting.

*Xu Wu,Zhihui Lai,Xianxu Hou,Jie Zhou,Ya-nan Zhang,Linlin Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LightQANet是一个用于低光图像增强的新框架，通过量化自适应特征学习来解决现有方法在低光条件下特征提取不可靠的问题，实现了跨不同光照条件的稳定图像质量提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有低光图像增强方法由于在严重退化的像素级信息下难以提取可靠特征表示，导致纹理恢复差、颜色不一致和伪影等问题。

Method: 提出LightQANet框架，包含两个核心模块：静态建模的Light Quantization Module（LQM）用于显式提取和量化光照相关因子，以及动态适应的Light-Aware Prompt Module（LAPM）通过可学习提示动态指导特征学习过程。

Result: 在多个低光数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法实现了最先进的性能，在各种挑战性光照场景下都取得了优异的定性和定量结果。

Conclusion: LightQANet通过量化自适应特征学习有效解决了低光图像增强中的特征提取不可靠问题，能够稳定提升图像质量并适应复杂变化的光照条件。

Abstract: Low-light image enhancement (LLIE) aims to improve illumination while
preserving high-quality color and texture. However, existing methods often fail
to extract reliable feature representations due to severely degraded
pixel-level information under low-light conditions, resulting in poor texture
restoration, color inconsistency, and artifact. To address these challenges, we
propose LightQANet, a novel framework that introduces quantized and adaptive
feature learning for low-light enhancement, aiming to achieve consistent and
robust image quality across diverse lighting conditions. From the static
modeling perspective, we design a Light Quantization Module (LQM) to explicitly
extract and quantify illumination-related factors from image features. By
enforcing structured light factor learning, LQM enhances the extraction of
light-invariant representations and mitigates feature inconsistency across
varying illumination levels. From the dynamic adaptation perspective, we
introduce a Light-Aware Prompt Module (LAPM), which encodes illumination priors
into learnable prompts to dynamically guide the feature learning process. LAPM
enables the model to flexibly adapt to complex and continuously changing
lighting conditions, further improving image enhancement. Extensive experiments
on multiple low-light datasets demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance, delivering superior qualitative and quantitative
results across various challenging lighting scenarios.

*Giuseppe Lorenzo Catalano,Agata Marta Soccini*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于无条件扩散模型的方法来重建火星表面地形，填补卫星图像中的缺失值，相比传统方法在重建精度和感知相似性方面表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 火星地形数据中存在大量缺失值，传统插值方法难以保持几何一致性，而地球上的条件方法无法应用于火星，因此需要开发专门的无条件深度学习方法。

Method: 使用无条件扩散模型，在12000个火星高度图增强数据集上训练，采用非均匀缩放策略捕捉多尺度地形特征，最终固定为128x128分辨率。

Result: 在1000个测试样本上，相比逆距离加权、克里金法和纳维-斯托克斯算法，该方法在RMSE上提升4-15%，在LPIPS上提升29-81%。

Conclusion: 无条件扩散模型能够有效重建火星表面地形，在精度和感知质量方面显著优于传统方法，为行星科学和VR应用提供了可靠的地形数据。

Abstract: Space exploration increasingly relies on Virtual Reality for several tasks,
such as mission planning, multidisciplinary scientific analysis, and astronaut
training. A key factor for the reliability of the simulations is having
accurate 3D representations of planetary terrains. Extraterrestrial heightmaps
derived from satellite imagery often contain missing values due to acquisition
and transmission constraints. Mars is among the most studied planets beyond
Earth, and its extensive terrain datasets make the Martian surface
reconstruction a valuable task, although many areas remain unmapped. Deep
learning algorithms can support void-filling tasks; however, whereas Earth's
comprehensive datasets enables the use of conditional methods, such approaches
cannot be applied to Mars. Current approaches rely on simpler interpolation
techniques which, however, often fail to preserve geometric coherence. In this
work, we propose a method for reconstructing the surface of Mars based on an
unconditional diffusion model. Training was conducted on an augmented dataset
of 12000 Martian heightmaps derived from NASA's HiRISE survey. A
non-homogeneous rescaling strategy captures terrain features across multiple
scales before resizing to a fixed 128x128 model resolution. We compared our
method against established void-filling and inpainting techniques, including
Inverse Distance Weighting, kriging, and Navier-Stokes algorithm, on an
evaluation set of 1000 samples. Results show that our approach consistently
outperforms these methods in terms of reconstruction accuracy (4-15% on RMSE)
and perceptual similarity (29-81% on LPIPS) with the original data.

Motivation: 解决微型飞行器群在频谱拥堵、干扰和高功耗环境中的可靠通信问题，受蜜蜂摇摆舞的高效非接触通信启发

Result: 实验验证了框架的有效性，实现了准确解码和低功耗，在受限环境中表现出良好的通信性能

Conclusion: 该视觉通信框架为微型飞行器群在受限环境中提供了一种节能高效的替代通信方案

Abstract: Reliable communication in Micro Air Vehicle (MAV) swarms is challenging in
environments, where conventional radio-based methods suffer from spectrum
congestion, jamming, and high power consumption. Inspired by the waggle dance
of honeybees, which efficiently communicate the location of food sources
without sound or contact, we propose a novel visual communication framework for
MAV swarms using motion-based signaling. In this framework, MAVs convey
information, such as heading and distance, through deliberate flight patterns,
which are passively captured by event cameras and interpreted using a
predefined visual codebook of four motion primitives: vertical (up/down),
horizontal (left/right), left-to-up-to-right, and left-to-down-to-right,
representing control symbols (``start'', ``end'', ``1'', ``0''). To decode
these signals, we design an event frame-based segmentation model and a
lightweight Spiking Neural Network (SNN) for action recognition. An integrated
decoding algorithm then combines segmentation and classification to robustly
interpret MAV motion sequences. Experimental results validate the framework's
effectiveness, which demonstrates accurate decoding and low power consumption,
and highlights its potential as an energy-efficient alternative for MAV
communication in constrained environments.

*Hojun Choi,Youngsun Lim,Jaeyo Shin,Hyunjung Shim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoT-PL框架通过引入视觉链式思考推理来改进开放词汇目标检测，在拥挤和遮挡场景中显著提升新类别的伪标签质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有开放词汇目标检测方法过度依赖直接图像-文本匹配，忽略了理解语义复杂场景所需的中间推理步骤，导致在拥挤或遮挡视觉环境中鲁棒性不足。

Method: 提出CoT-PL框架，将目标理解分解为三个可解释步骤：区域感知、零样本类别识别和背景定位，并引入对比背景学习来促进目标与背景的特征解耦。

Result: 在拥挤和遮挡场景中，新类别伪标签质量相比最佳先前方法分别提升103.4%和168.4%；在开放词汇COCO上AP50提升7.7，在LVIS上新类别mask AP提升2.9，达到新的最先进水平。

Conclusion: CoT-PL通过结构化视觉链式思考推理和对比背景学习，显著提升了开放词汇目标检测在复杂场景中的鲁棒性和性能。

Abstract: Open-vocabulary object detection (OVD) seeks to recognize and localize object
categories beyond those seen during training. Recent approaches typically
leverage vision-language models (VLMs) to generate pseudo-labels using
image-text alignment, allowing detectors to generalize to unseen classes
without explicit supervision. However, these methods depend heavily on direct
image-text matching, neglecting the intermediate reasoning steps essential for
interpreting semantically complex scenes. This results in limited robustness
when confronted with crowded or occluded visual contexts. In this paper, we
introduce CoT-PL, a new framework that employs structured visual
chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning into the pseudo-labeling process. CoT-PL
decomposes object understanding into three interpretable steps: (1) region
perception even for unseen objects, (2) category recognition via zero-shot
reasoning, and (3) background grounding to separate semantically complex
objects. Crucially, the third step naturally motivates our contrastive
background learning (CBL) that uses the pre-computed background cues as
negatives to promote feature disentanglement between objects and background. In
this way, CoT reasoning and CBL form an integrated pipeline tailored to robust
pseudo-labeling in crowded or occluded scenes. Notably, in these two settings,
our novel-class pseudo-label quality achieves relative improvements of 103.4%
and 168.4% over the best prior, respectively. Our extensive experiments
demonstrate that CoT-PL achieves +7.7 AP50 on open-vocabulary COCO and +2.9
mask AP on LVIS for novel classes, setting a new state of the art.

TL;DR: 开发了PRISM模型，一种可解释的AI模型，通过整合连续变异谱来表征结直肠癌的形态多样性，在5年总生存期预测上表现优异，超越现有方法15-23%的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基础模型在计算病理学中往往忽略器官特异性关键形态模式，而这些模式代表不同的生物学过程，会显著影响肿瘤行为、治疗反应和患者预后。

Method: PRISM模型整合了连续变异谱来表征形态多样性，基于424名III期结直肠癌患者的874万张组织学图像进行训练。

Result: PRISM在5年总生存期预测上表现优异（AUC=0.70，准确率68.37%，HR=3.34），性别无关的稳健性，在不同临床病理亚组中表现稳定。

Conclusion: PRISM模型能够有效捕捉结直肠癌的形态多样性，提供优越的预后预测性能，并证实了治疗方案的生存差异无统计学意义。

Abstract: Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains the third most prevalent malignancy globally,
with approximately 154,000 new cases and 54,000 projected deaths anticipated
for 2025. The recent advancement of foundation models in computational
pathology has been largely propelled by task agnostic methodologies that can
overlook organ-specific crucial morphological patterns that represent distinct
biological processes that can fundamentally influence tumor behavior,
therapeutic response, and patient outcomes. The aim of this study is to develop
a novel, interpretable AI model, PRISM (Prognostic Representation of Integrated
Spatial Morphology), that incorporates a continuous variability spectrum within
each distinct morphology to characterize phenotypic diversity and reflecting
the principle that malignant transformation occurs through incremental
evolutionary processes rather than abrupt phenotypic shifts. PRISM is trained
on 8.74 million histological images extracted from surgical resection specimens
of 424 patients with stage III CRC. PRISM achieved superior prognostic
performance for five-year OS (AUC = 0.70 +- 0.04; accuracy = 68.37% +- 4.75%;
HR = 3.34, 95% CI = 2.28-4.90; p < 0.0001), outperforming existing CRC-specific
methods by 15% and AI foundation models by ~23% accuracy. It showed
sex-agnostic robustness (AUC delta = 0.02; accuracy delta = 0.15%) and stable
performance across clinicopathological subgroups, with minimal accuracy
fluctuation (delta = 1.44%) between 5FU/LV and CPT-11/5FU/LV regimens,
replicating the Alliance cohort finding of no survival difference between
treatments.

TL;DR: R-Super是一种利用医学报告而非手动绘制的肿瘤掩模来训练AI进行肿瘤分割的方法，显著降低了AI训练的成本和人力需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统AI肿瘤分割模型需要大量手动绘制的肿瘤掩模，成本高昂且耗时。而临床实践中每个CT扫描都配有描述肿瘤特征的医学报告，这些丰富信息未被充分利用。

Method: R-Super训练AI根据医学报告中的描述来分割肿瘤，利用101,654份医学报告进行训练，无需大量手动掩模。

Result: 仅使用报告训练的模型性能与使用723个掩模训练的模型相当。结合报告和掩模后，灵敏度提升13%，特异性提升8%，在7种肿瘤类型中有5种检测效果超过放射科医生。

Conclusion: 该方法挑战了大规模手动肿瘤掩模创建的必要性，为多种肿瘤类型的早期检测提供了可扩展且易于获取的途径。

Abstract: Early tumor detection save lives. Each year, more than 300 million computed
tomography (CT) scans are performed worldwide, offering a vast opportunity for
effective cancer screening. However, detecting small or early-stage tumors on
these CT scans remains challenging, even for experts. Artificial intelligence
(AI) models can assist by highlighting suspicious regions, but training such
models typically requires extensive tumor masks--detailed, voxel-wise outlines
of tumors manually drawn by radiologists. Drawing these masks is costly,
requiring years of effort and millions of dollars. In contrast, nearly every CT
scan in clinical practice is already accompanied by medical reports describing
the tumor's size, number, appearance, and sometimes, pathology
results--information that is rich, abundant, and often underutilized for AI
training. We introduce R-Super, which trains AI to segment tumors that match
their descriptions in medical reports. This approach scales AI training with
large collections of readily available medical reports, substantially reducing
the need for manually drawn tumor masks. When trained on 101,654 reports, AI
models achieved performance comparable to those trained on 723 masks. Combining
reports and masks further improved sensitivity by +13% and specificity by +8%,
surpassing radiologists in detecting five of the seven tumor types. Notably,
R-Super enabled segmentation of tumors in the spleen, gallbladder, prostate,
bladder, uterus, and esophagus, for which no public masks or AI models
previously existed. This study challenges the long-held belief that
large-scale, labor-intensive tumor mask creation is indispensable, establishing
a scalable and accessible path toward early detection across diverse tumor
types.

TL;DR: PRTraj是一个新的轨迹表示学习框架，通过环境感知和路径选择建模来改进轨迹嵌入，在多个下游任务中表现出色且具有数据效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有轨迹表示学习方法将轨迹视为孤立的时空序列，忽略了外部环境和内部路径选择行为对轨迹形成的影响。

Method: PRTraj包含环境感知模块和路径选择编码器，前者从POI分布中捕获多粒度环境语义，后者将路段转换建模为决策序列来捕捉路径选择行为。

Result: 在3个真实世界数据集和5个下游任务上的广泛实验验证了PRTraj的有效性和泛化能力，在少样本场景下也保持稳健性能。

Conclusion: PRTraj通过统一环境感知和路径选择建模，显著提升了轨迹表示学习的性能，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Trajectory Representation Learning (TRL) aims to encode raw trajectories into
low-dimensional vectors, which can then be leveraged in various downstream
tasks, including travel time estimation, location prediction, and trajectory
similarity analysis. However, existing TRL methods suffer from a key oversight:
treating trajectories as isolated spatio-temporal sequences, without
considering the external environment and internal route choice behavior that
govern their formation. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel framework that
unifies comprehensive environment \textbf{P}erception and explicit
\textbf{R}oute choice modeling for effective \textbf{Traj}ectory representation
learning, dubbed \textbf{PRTraj}. Specifically, PRTraj first introduces an
Environment Perception Module to enhance the road network by capturing
multi-granularity environmental semantics from surrounding POI distributions.
Building on this environment-aware backbone, a Route Choice Encoder then
captures the route choice behavior inherent in each trajectory by modeling its
constituent road segment transitions as a sequence of decisions. These
route-choice-aware representations are finally aggregated to form the global
trajectory embedding. Extensive experiments on 3 real-world datasets across 5
downstream tasks validate the effectiveness and generalizability of PRTraj.
Moreover, PRTraj demonstrates strong data efficiency, maintaining robust
performance under few-shot scenarios. Our code is available at:

Motivation: 解决大模型无法在智能手机上部署的问题，因为移动设备内存和计算资源有限，而现有量化方法在保持模型质量方面存在挑战。

Method: 采用渐进式精度降低策略，从32位到4位逐步量化模型参数，在优化过程中利用分数位来维持生成质量。

Result: 在多种扩散模型(SD3.5-Medium、Sana、PixArt、FLUX.1-schnell)上显示质量提升，比标准QAT的FiD降低4-7%，成功在三星S25U手机上部署Sana模型。

Conclusion: SHORT方法有效解决了移动设备部署大模型的挑战，在保持生成质量的同时实现了高效计算。

Abstract: State-of-the-art (SOTA) generative models have demonstrated impressive
capabilities in image synthesis or text generation, often with a large capacity
model. However, these large models cannot be deployed on smartphones due to the
limited availability of on-board memory and computations. Quantization methods
lower the precision of the model parameters, allowing for efficient
computations, \eg, in \INT{8}. Although aggressive quantization addresses
efficiency and memory constraints, preserving the quality of the model remains
a challenge. To retain quality in previous aggressive quantization, we propose
a new fractional bits quantization (\short) approach. The novelty is a simple
yet effective idea: we progressively reduce the model's precision from 32 to 4
bits per parameter, and exploit the fractional bits during optimization to
maintain high generation quality. We show that the \short{} yields improved
quality on a variety of diffusion models, including SD3.5-Medium, Sana,
\pixart, and FLUX.1-schnell, while achieving $4-7\%$ lower FiD than standard
QAT. Finally, we deploy and run Sana on a Samsung S25U, which runs on the
Qualcomm SM8750-AB Snapdragon 8 Elite Hexagon Tensor Processor (HTP).

Motivation: 解决肿瘤分割AI训练中缺乏大规模体素级标注数据集的问题，发现真实数据训练存在性能瓶颈，而合成数据可以更高效地提升模型性能。

Method: 创建了AbdomenAtlas 2.0数据集，包含10,135个CT扫描，由23名放射科专家对六个器官（胰腺、肝脏、肾脏、结肠、食管和子宫）进行体素级肿瘤标注，并包含5,893个对照扫描。

Result: 使用合成数据仅需500个真实扫描即可达到与1,500个真实扫描相同的性能。AbdomenAtlas 2.0在分布内测试中DSC提升7%，分布外测试中提升16%。

Conclusion: 合成数据可以显著提升数据扩展效率，AbdomenAtlas 2.0为训练多器官肿瘤分割AI提供了强大的基础，性能显著优于现有公共数据集。

Abstract: AI for tumor segmentation is limited by the lack of large, voxel-wise
annotated datasets, which are hard to create and require medical experts. In
our proprietary JHH dataset of 3,000 annotated pancreatic tumor scans, we found
that AI performance stopped improving after 1,500 scans. With synthetic data,
we reached the same performance using only 500 real scans. This finding
suggests that synthetic data can steepen data scaling laws, enabling more
efficient model training than real data alone. Motivated by these lessons, we
created AbdomenAtlas 2.0--a dataset of 10,135 CT scans with a total of 15,130
tumor instances per-voxel manually annotated in six organs (pancreas, liver,
kidney, colon, esophagus, and uterus) and 5,893 control scans. Annotated by 23
expert radiologists, it is several orders of magnitude larger than existing
public tumor datasets. While we continue expanding the dataset, the current
version of AbdomenAtlas 2.0 already provides a strong foundation--based on
lessons from the JHH dataset--for training AI to segment tumors in six organs.
It achieves notable improvements over public datasets, with a +7% DSC gain on
in-distribution tests and +16% on out-of-distribution tests.

Abstract: Spatial perception and reasoning are crucial for Vision-Language-Action (VLA)
models to accomplish fine-grained manipulation tasks. However, existing
approaches often lack the ability to understand and reason over the essential
3D structures necessary for precise control. To address this limitation, we
propose QDepth-VLA, a general framework that augments VLA models with an
auxiliary depth prediction task. A dedicated depth expert is designed to
predict quantized latent tokens of depth maps obtained from a VQ-VAE encoder,
enabling the model to learn depth-aware representations that capture critical
geometric cues. Experimental results on the simulation benchmarks and
real-world tasks demonstrate that QDepth-VLA yields strong spatial reasoning
and competitive performance on manipulation tasks.

Abstract: Video generation models have achieved remarkable progress, particularly
excelling in realistic scenarios; however, their performance degrades notably
in imaginative scenarios. These prompts often involve rarely co-occurring
concepts with long-distance semantic relationships, falling outside training
distributions. Existing methods typically apply test-time scaling for improving
video quality, but their fixed search spaces and static reward designs limit
adaptability to imaginative scenarios. To fill this gap, we propose
ImagerySearch, a prompt-guided adaptive test-time search strategy that
dynamically adjusts both the inference search space and reward function
according to semantic relationships in the prompt. This enables more coherent
and visually plausible videos in challenging imaginative settings. To evaluate
progress in this direction, we introduce LDT-Bench, the first dedicated
benchmark for long-distance semantic prompts, consisting of 2,839 diverse
concept pairs and an automated protocol for assessing creative generation
capabilities. Extensive experiments show that ImagerySearch consistently
outperforms strong video generation baselines and existing test-time scaling
approaches on LDT-Bench, and achieves competitive improvements on VBench,
demonstrating its effectiveness across diverse prompt types. We will release
LDT-Bench and code to facilitate future research on imaginative video
generation.

Method: 开发深度学习框架，分类皮肤病变并量化ABCD特征评分，在潜在空间中可视化病变从良性痣到恶性黑色素瘤的演化轨迹。

Conclusion: 该框架使医生能将机器学习诊断与临床相关标准联系起来，有助于更好地理解皮肤癌进展过程。

Abstract: Early detection of melanoma has grown to be essential because it
significantly improves survival rates, but automated analysis of skin lesions
still remains challenging. ABCDE, which stands for Asymmetry, Border
irregularity, Color variation, Diameter, and Evolving, is a well-known
classification method for skin lesions, but most deep learning mechanisms treat
it as a black box, as most of the human interpretable features are not
explained. In this work, we propose a deep learning framework that both
classifies skin lesions into categories and also quantifies scores for each
ABCD feature. It simulates the evolution of these features over time in order
to represent the E aspect, opening more windows for future exploration. The A,
B, C, and D values are quantified particularly within this work. Moreover, this
framework also visualizes ABCD feature trajectories in latent space as skin
lesions evolve from benign nevuses to malignant melanoma. The experiments are
conducted using the HAM10000 dataset that contains around ten thousand images
of skin lesions of varying stages. In summary, the classification worked with
an accuracy of around 89 percent, with melanoma AUC being 0.96, while the
feature evaluation performed well in predicting asymmetry, color variation, and
diameter, though border irregularity remains more difficult to model. Overall,
this work provides a deep learning framework that will allow doctors to link ML
diagnoses to clinically relevant criteria, thus improving our understanding of
skin cancer progression.

Conclusion: 通过多模态整合和高效蒸馏，可以在保持竞争力的同时显著降低模型参数，实现实际部署应用。

Abstract: The real-world is inherently multi-modal at its core. Our tools observe and
take snapshots of it, in digital form, such as videos or sounds, however much
of it is lost. Similarly for actions and information passing between humans,
languages are used as a written form of communication. Traditionally, Machine
Learning models have been unimodal (i.e. rgb -> semantic or text ->
sentiment_class). Recent trends go towards bi-modality, where images and text
are learned together, however, in order to truly understand the world, we need
to integrate all these independent modalities. In this work we try to combine
as many visual modalities as we can using little to no human supervision. In
order to do this, we use pre-trained experts and procedural combinations
between them on top of raw videos using a fully autonomous data-pipeline, which
we also open-source. We then make use of PHG-MAE, a model specifically designed
to leverage multi-modal data. We show that this model which was efficiently
distilled into a low-parameter (<1M) can have competitive results compared to
models of ~300M parameters. We deploy this model and analyze the use-case of
real-time semantic segmentation from handheld devices or webcams on commodity
hardware. Finally, we deploy other off-the-shelf models using the same
framework, such as DPT for near real-time depth estimation.

TL;DR: 系统评估多模态大语言模型在面部识别任务上的表现，发现虽然MLLMs能捕捉丰富的语义信息，但在零样本高精度识别场景中仍落后于专用模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在各种视觉语言任务中表现出色，但其在人脸识别方面的潜力尚未充分探索，特别是开源MLLMs需要在标准基准上与现有人脸识别模型进行对比评估。

Method: 在多个标准人脸识别数据集（LFW、CALFW、CPLFW、CFP、AgeDB和RFW）上对最先进的MLLMs进行系统性基准测试。

Result: 实验结果表明，MLLMs能够捕捉对人脸相关任务有用的丰富语义线索，但在零样本应用的高精度识别场景中落后于专用模型。

Conclusion: 该基准为推进基于MLLM的人脸识别提供了基础，为设计具有更高准确性和泛化能力的下一代模型提供了见解。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable performance
across diverse vision-and-language tasks. However, their potential in face
recognition remains underexplored. In particular, the performance of
open-source MLLMs needs to be evaluated and compared with existing face
recognition models on standard benchmarks with similar protocol. In this work,
we present a systematic benchmark of state-of-the-art MLLMs for face
recognition on several face recognition datasets, including LFW, CALFW, CPLFW,
CFP, AgeDB and RFW. Experimental results reveal that while MLLMs capture rich
semantic cues useful for face-related tasks, they lag behind specialized models
in high-precision recognition scenarios in zero-shot applications. This
benchmark provides a foundation for advancing MLLM-based face recognition,
offering insights for the design of next-generation models with higher accuracy
and generalization. The source code of our benchmark is publicly available in

*Guangyi Han,Wei Zhai,Yuhang Yang,Yang Cao,Zheng-Jun Zha*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Free-Form HOI Generation方法，旨在生成可控、多样且物理合理的手-物体交互，超越了传统固定抓握模式，支持推、戳、旋转等自由形式交互。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有HOI生成研究局限于固定抓握模式，控制依赖于物理先验或通用意图指令，无法捕捉日常HOI的多样性。

Method: 构建WildO2数据集，包含4.4k个独特交互；提出TOUCH框架，基于多级扩散模型，通过显式接触建模进行条件控制，并利用接触一致性和物理约束进行细化。

Result: 实验证明该方法能够生成可控、多样且物理合理的手部交互，代表日常活动。

Conclusion: Free-Form HOI Generation成功扩展了HOI从抓握到自由形式交互，通过细粒度语义控制生成超越抓握先验的多样化手部姿势。

Abstract: Hand-object interaction (HOI) is fundamental for humans to express intent.
Existing HOI generation research is predominantly confined to fixed grasping
patterns, where control is tied to physical priors such as force closure or
generic intent instructions, even when expressed through elaborate language.
Such an overly general conditioning imposes a strong inductive bias for stable
grasps, thus failing to capture the diversity of daily HOI. To address these
limitations, we introduce Free-Form HOI Generation, which aims to generate
controllable, diverse, and physically plausible HOI conditioned on fine-grained
intent, extending HOI from grasping to free-form interactions, like pushing,
poking, and rotating. To support this task, we construct WildO2, an in-the-wild
diverse 3D HOI dataset, which includes diverse HOI derived from internet
videos. Specifically, it contains 4.4k unique interactions across 92 intents
and 610 object categories, each with detailed semantic annotations. Building on
this dataset, we propose TOUCH, a three-stage framework centered on a
multi-level diffusion model that facilitates fine-grained semantic control to
generate versatile hand poses beyond grasping priors. This process leverages
explicit contact modeling for conditioning and is subsequently refined with
contact consistency and physical constraints to ensure realism. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate our method's ability to generate controllable, diverse,
and physically plausible hand interactions representative of daily activities.

TL;DR: BADAS是一个基于真实世界行车记录仪碰撞数据训练的碰撞预测模型家族，专门针对自车威胁进行优化，在多个基准测试中实现最先进的性能表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有碰撞预测方法无法区分自车威胁和与自车无关的随机事故，导致实际部署中产生过多误报。

Method: 使用V-JEPA2骨干网络进行端到端训练，重新标注主要基准数据集以识别自车参与情况，添加共识预警时间标签，并在需要时合成负样本。提供BADAS-Open（1.5k公开视频）和BADAS1.0（40k专有视频）两个版本。

Result: 在DAD、DADA-2000、DoTA和Nexar数据集上，BADAS实现了最先进的AP/AUC性能，优于前向碰撞ADAS基线，并产生更真实的事故时间估计。

Conclusion: BADAS通过专门的自车中心化评估基准，显著提升了碰撞预测的准确性和实用性，并开源模型权重和代码以促进相关研究。

Abstract: Existing collision prediction methods often fail to distinguish between
ego-vehicle threats and random accidents not involving the ego vehicle, leading
to excessive false alerts in real-world deployment. We present BADAS, a family
of collision prediction models trained on Nexar's real-world dashcam collision
dataset -- the first benchmark designed explicitly for ego-centric evaluation.
We re-annotate major benchmarks to identify ego involvement, add consensus
alert-time labels, and synthesize negatives where needed, enabling fair AP/AUC
and temporal evaluation. BADAS uses a V-JEPA2 backbone trained end-to-end and
comes in two variants: BADAS-Open (trained on our 1.5k public videos) and
BADAS1.0 (trained on 40k proprietary videos). Across DAD, DADA-2000, DoTA, and
Nexar, BADAS achieves state-of-the-art AP/AUC and outperforms a
forward-collision ADAS baseline while producing more realistic time-to-accident
estimates. We release our BADAS-Open model weights and code, along with
re-annotations of all evaluation datasets to promote ego-centric collision
prediction research.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ScaleWeaver是一个基于视觉自回归模型的可控文本到图像生成框架，通过参数高效微调实现高保真度和精确控制，改进了MMDiT块并提出了Reference Attention模块来有效整合条件信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然扩散模型已经探索了控制机制，但在视觉自回归范式下实现精确灵活的控制仍然研究不足，需要弥合这一关键差距。

Method: 提出了ScaleWeaver框架，核心是改进的MMDiT块和Reference Attention模块，该模块丢弃了图像→条件的非必要注意力，降低计算成本同时稳定控制注入，并强调参数重用，使用零初始化线性投影确保控制信号有效整合而不破坏基础模型的生成能力。

Result: 大量实验表明，ScaleWeaver能够提供高质量生成和精确控制，同时在效率上优于基于扩散的方法。

Conclusion: ScaleWeaver是视觉自回归范式中实用有效的可控文本到图像生成解决方案。

Abstract: Text-to-image generation with visual autoregressive~(VAR) models has recently
achieved impressive advances in generation fidelity and inference efficiency.
While control mechanisms have been explored for diffusion models, enabling
precise and flexible control within VAR paradigm remains underexplored. To
bridge this critical gap, in this paper, we introduce ScaleWeaver, a novel
framework designed to achieve high-fidelity, controllable generation upon
advanced VAR models through parameter-efficient fine-tuning. The core module in
ScaleWeaver is the improved MMDiT block with the proposed Reference Attention
module, which efficiently and effectively incorporates conditional information.
Different from MM Attention, the proposed Reference Attention module discards
the unnecessary attention from image$\rightarrow$condition, reducing
computational cost while stabilizing control injection. Besides, it
strategically emphasizes parameter reuse, leveraging the capability of the VAR
backbone itself with a few introduced parameters to process control
information, and equipping a zero-initialized linear projection to ensure that
control signals are incorporated effectively without disrupting the generative
capability of the base model. Extensive experiments show that ScaleWeaver
delivers high-quality generation and precise control while attaining superior
efficiency over diffusion-based methods, making ScaleWeaver a practical and
effective solution for controllable text-to-image generation within the visual
autoregressive paradigm. Code and models will be released.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了nlg2choice方法，通过两阶段处理解决多模态大语言模型在细粒度视觉分类中的自由形式响应评估问题，特别是在高选择项（数百到数千）的多选题和检索场景中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要关注纯语言任务或不超过5个选项的多选题，无法应对细粒度视觉分类中数百到数千个高度相关选项的挑战，且在检索问题中计算所有选项概率的计算成本过高。

Method: nlg2choice两阶段方法：首先向MLLM提出开放式问题，然后使用纯文本约束解码预测最可能的选择；在检索设置中采用早期停止方法显著提高吞吐量。

Result: 在七个细粒度视觉数据集上的实验显示，该方法在分类和检索评估方面均有改进，且性能在各种自然语言任务实现方式下保持稳定。

Conclusion: nlg2choice方法有效解决了高选择项多选题和检索问题中的评估挑战，为细粒度视觉分类提供了实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Despite the renewed interest in zero-shot visual classification due to the
rise of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), the problem of evaluating
free-form responses of auto-regressive models remains a persistent challenge.
Most existing works focus on language-only tasks or don't consider Multiple
Choice Questions (MCQs) beyond 5-way options, both of which are critical
capabilities to solve tasks in Fine-Grained Visual Classification (FGVC) where
choice counts are in the hundreds to thousands and the choices are highly
related. Furthermore, in this highly multi-way MCQ setting it is not clear how
to extend LLM choice extraction to retrieval-based problems, where computing
probabilities over the choice set is computationally costly. In this work we
investigate nlg2choice, a simple two-stage method which first asks the MLLM an
open-ended question for the task with minimal constraints, then uses text-only
constrained decoding to predict the most likely choice. In retrieval settings,
we compute the probability of the constrained response taking that choice with
an early stopping method to significantly improve throughput. Our results show
improvement over a suite of seven fine-grained visual datasets when evaluating
in terms of classification and retrieval, and show that this performance holds
over the various ways that users of LLMs can implement tasks in natural
language.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有半监督视频异常检测方法难以检测涉及物体交互的复杂异常，且缺乏可解释性

Method: 使用MLLM查询不同时刻物体对的视觉输入，生成活动与交互的文本描述，作为视频中物体活动的高层表示，在测试时与训练视频中的文本描述进行比较

Result: 在基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法不仅能有效检测基于交互的复杂异常，还在无交互异常的数据集上达到最先进性能

Conclusion: 该方法为视频异常检测提供了可解释性解决方案，并能与传统VAD方法结合进一步提升可解释性

Abstract: Existing semi-supervised video anomaly detection (VAD) methods often struggle
with detecting complex anomalies involving object interactions and generally
lack explainability. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel VAD
framework leveraging Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Unlike previous
MLLM-based approaches that make direct anomaly judgments at the frame level,
our method focuses on extracting and interpreting object activity and
interactions over time. By querying an MLLM with visual inputs of object pairs
at different moments, we generate textual descriptions of the activity and
interactions from nominal videos. These textual descriptions serve as a
high-level representation of the activity and interactions of objects in a
video. They are used to detect anomalies during test time by comparing them to
textual descriptions found in nominal training videos. Our approach inherently
provides explainability and can be combined with many traditional VAD methods
to further enhance their interpretability. Extensive experiments on benchmark
datasets demonstrate that our method not only detects complex interaction-based
anomalies effectively but also achieves state-of-the-art performance on
datasets without interaction anomalies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于密集视频对象字幕任务的复杂性和手动标注的高成本，现有方法采用分离训练策略导致性能不佳，需要开发端到端的解决方案。

Method: 利用最先进的视觉语言模型生成时空定位实体的合成字幕，扩展LVIS和LV-VIS数据集，训练MaskCaptioner端到端模型。

Result: 在LVISCap和LV-VISCap数据集上预训练后，MaskCaptioner在VidSTG、VLN和BenSMOT三个基准测试中实现了最先进的DVOC结果。

Conclusion: 通过合成字幕扩展数据集和端到端训练，MaskCaptioner有效解决了密集视频对象字幕任务，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Dense Video Object Captioning (DVOC) is the task of jointly detecting,
tracking, and captioning object trajectories in a video, requiring the ability
to understand spatio-temporal details and describe them in natural language.
Due to the complexity of the task and the high cost associated with manual
annotation, previous approaches resort to disjoint training strategies,
potentially leading to suboptimal performance. To circumvent this issue, we
propose to generate captions about spatio-temporally localized entities
leveraging a state-of-the-art VLM. By extending the LVIS and LV-VIS datasets
with our synthetic captions (LVISCap and LV-VISCap), we train MaskCaptioner, an
end-to-end model capable of jointly detecting, segmenting, tracking and
captioning object trajectories. Moreover, with pretraining on LVISCap and
LV-VISCap, MaskCaptioner achieves state-of-the-art DVOC results on three
existing benchmarks, VidSTG, VLN and BenSMOT. The datasets and code are
available at https://www.gabriel.fiastre.fr/maskcaptioner/.

TL;DR: 3DScenePrompt是一个视频生成框架，通过双时空条件化和3D场景记忆实现长视频生成，支持精确相机控制并保持场景一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常基于单张图像或短视频片段进行条件化，难以在生成长视频时保持场景一致性和精确相机控制。

Method: 采用双时空条件化：时间相邻帧用于运动连续性，空间相邻内容用于场景一致性。引入3D场景记忆存储静态几何信息，通过动态SLAM和动态掩码策略分离静态场景和动态元素。

Result: 在场景一致性、相机可控性和生成质量方面显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该框架能够有效维护长距离空间一致性，实现精确相机控制，同时保持计算效率和运动真实性。

Abstract: We present 3DScenePrompt, a framework that generates the next video chunk
from arbitrary-length input while enabling precise camera control and
preserving scene consistency. Unlike methods conditioned on a single image or a
short clip, we employ dual spatio-temporal conditioning that reformulates
context-view referencing across the input video. Our approach conditions on
both temporally adjacent frames for motion continuity and spatially adjacent
content for scene consistency. However, when generating beyond temporal
boundaries, directly using spatially adjacent frames would incorrectly preserve
dynamic elements from the past. We address this by introducing a 3D scene
memory that represents exclusively the static geometry extracted from the
entire input video. To construct this memory, we leverage dynamic SLAM with our
newly introduced dynamic masking strategy that explicitly separates static
scene geometry from moving elements. The static scene representation can then
be projected to any target viewpoint, providing geometrically consistent warped
views that serve as strong 3D spatial prompts while allowing dynamic regions to
evolve naturally from temporal context. This enables our model to maintain
long-range spatial coherence and precise camera control without sacrificing
computational efficiency or motion realism. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our framework significantly outperforms existing methods in scene
consistency, camera controllability, and generation quality. Project page :

Conclusion: 提出的连续掩码自回归运动变换器结合多模态融合机制，在多模态人体运动生成任务中表现出色，代码将公开。

Abstract: Whole-body multi-modal human motion generation poses two primary challenges:
creating an effective motion generation mechanism and integrating various
modalities, such as text, speech, and music, into a cohesive framework. Unlike
previous methods that usually employ discrete masked modeling or autoregressive
modeling, we develop a continuous masked autoregressive motion transformer,
where a causal attention is performed considering the sequential nature within
the human motion. Within this transformer, we introduce a gated linear
attention and an RMSNorm module, which drive the transformer to pay attention
to the key actions and suppress the instability caused by either the abnormal
movements or the heterogeneous distributions within multi-modalities. To
further enhance both the motion generation and the multimodal generalization,
we employ the DiT structure to diffuse the conditions from the transformer
towards the targets. To fuse different modalities, AdaLN and cross-attention
are leveraged to inject the text, speech, and music signals. Experimental
results demonstrate that our framework outperforms previous methods across all
modalities, including text-to-motion, speech-to-gesture, and music-to-dance.
The code of our method will be made public.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频生成模型在处理复杂运动时存在困难，生成的运动往往不够自然、平滑且与上下文不一致，这限制了其实际应用。

Method: 采用Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)框架，使用真实世界视频作为正样本，与错误模型输出进行对比，通过定制损失函数实现迭代自校正。同时构建了RealAction-5K数据集支持训练。

Conclusion: RealDPO通过真实世界数据驱动的偏好学习，有效提升了视频生成中复杂运动的合成质量，为解决运动真实性问题提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Video generative models have recently achieved notable advancements in
synthesis quality. However, generating complex motions remains a critical
challenge, as existing models often struggle to produce natural, smooth, and
contextually consistent movements. This gap between generated and real-world
motions limits their practical applicability. To address this issue, we
introduce RealDPO, a novel alignment paradigm that leverages real-world data as
positive samples for preference learning, enabling more accurate motion
synthesis. Unlike traditional supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which offers
limited corrective feedback, RealDPO employs Direct Preference Optimization
(DPO) with a tailored loss function to enhance motion realism. By contrasting
real-world videos with erroneous model outputs, RealDPO enables iterative
self-correction, progressively refining motion quality. To support
post-training in complex motion synthesis, we propose RealAction-5K, a curated
dataset of high-quality videos capturing human daily activities with rich and
precise motion details. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RealDPO
significantly improves video quality, text alignment, and motion realism
compared to state-of-the-art models and existing preference optimization
techniques.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have excelled in textual reasoning, they
struggle with mathematical domains like geometry that intrinsically rely on
visual aids. Existing approaches to Visual Chain-of-Thought (VCoT) are often
limited by rigid external tools or fail to generate the high-fidelity,
strategically-timed diagrams necessary for complex problem-solving. To bridge
this gap, we introduce MathCanvas, a comprehensive framework designed to endow
unified Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) with intrinsic VCoT capabilities for
mathematics. Our approach consists of two phases. First, a Visual Manipulation
stage pre-trains the model on a novel 15.2M-pair corpus, comprising 10M
caption-to-diagram pairs (MathCanvas-Imagen) and 5.2M step-by-step editing
trajectories (MathCanvas-Edit), to master diagram generation and editing.
Second, a Strategic Visual-Aided Reasoning stage fine-tunes the model on
MathCanvas-Instruct, a new 219K-example dataset of interleaved visual-textual
reasoning paths, teaching it when and how to leverage visual aids. To
facilitate rigorous evaluation, we introduce MathCanvas-Bench, a challenging
benchmark with 3K problems that require models to produce interleaved
visual-textual solutions. Our model, BAGEL-Canvas, trained under this
framework, achieves an 86% relative improvement over strong LMM baselines on
MathCanvas-Bench, demonstrating excellent generalization to other public math
benchmarks. Our work provides a complete toolkit-framework, datasets, and
benchmark-to unlock complex, human-like visual-aided reasoning in LMMs. Project

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: C4D是一个从单目视频恢复4D动态场景的框架，通过结合短期光流和长期点跟踪来扩展现有3D重建方法，能够分离运动物体与静态背景，实现完整的4D重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的点图3D重建方法（如DUSt3R）在处理动态场景时效果不佳，因为运动物体违反了多视角几何约束，导致重建不准确。需要专门的方法来处理动态场景的4D重建。

Method: C4D框架预测点图的同时捕获两种对应关系：短期光流和长期点跟踪。训练动态感知点跟踪器提供运动信息，估计运动掩码分离运动元素与静态背景。引入动态场景优化目标来恢复每帧3D几何和相机参数，将2D轨迹提升为平滑3D轨迹。

Result: 实验表明C4D框架实现了完整的4D恢复，在深度估计、相机姿态估计和点跟踪等多个下游任务中表现出强大性能。

Conclusion: C4D通过时间对应关系成功扩展了3D重建公式到4D，能够有效处理动态场景，实现集成化的4D重建。

Abstract: Recovering 4D from monocular video, which jointly estimates dynamic geometry
and camera poses, is an inevitably challenging problem. While recent
pointmap-based 3D reconstruction methods (e.g., DUSt3R) have made great
progress in reconstructing static scenes, directly applying them to dynamic
scenes leads to inaccurate results. This discrepancy arises because moving
objects violate multi-view geometric constraints, disrupting the
reconstruction. To address this, we introduce C4D, a framework that leverages
temporal Correspondences to extend existing 3D reconstruction formulation to
4D. Specifically, apart from predicting pointmaps, C4D captures two types of
correspondences: short-term optical flow and long-term point tracking. We train
a dynamic-aware point tracker that provides additional mobility information,
facilitating the estimation of motion masks to separate moving elements from
the static background, thus offering more reliable guidance for dynamic scenes.
Furthermore, we introduce a set of dynamic scene optimization objectives to
recover per-frame 3D geometry and camera parameters. Simultaneously, the
correspondences lift 2D trajectories into smooth 3D trajectories, enabling
fully integrated 4D reconstruction. Experiments show that our framework
achieves complete 4D recovery and demonstrates strong performance across
multiple downstream tasks, including depth estimation, camera pose estimation,
and point tracking. Project Page: https://littlepure2333.github.io/C4D

Abstract: Precipitation nowcasting, predicting future radar echo sequences from current
observations, is a critical yet challenging task due to the inherently chaotic

advances in diffusion-based models attempt to capture both large-scale motion
and fine-grained stochastic variability, they often suffer from scalability
issues: latent-space approaches require a separately trained autoencoder,
adding complexity and limiting generalization, while pixel-space approaches are
computationally intensive and often omit attention mechanisms, reducing their
ability to model long-range spatio-temporal dependencies. To address these
limitations, we propose a Token-wise Attention integrated into not only the
U-Net diffusion model but also the spatio-temporal encoder that dynamically
captures multi-scale spatial interactions and temporal evolution. Unlike prior
approaches, our method natively integrates attention into the architecture
without incurring the high resource cost typical of pixel-space diffusion,
thereby eliminating the need for separate latent modules. Our extensive
experiments and visual evaluations across diverse datasets demonstrate that the
proposed method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, yielding
superior local fidelity, generalization, and robustness in complex
precipitation forecasting scenarios.

*Miao Hu,Zhiwei Huang,Tai Wang,Jiangmiao Pang,Dahua Lin,Nanning Zheng,Runsen Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了ChangingGrounding基准和Mem-ChangingGrounder方法，用于在动态变化的3D场景中通过利用历史观察和高效探索来实现视觉定位，显著减少探索成本并提高定位精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D视觉定位方法假设场景点云是重建且最新的，这在实际应用中需要频繁重新扫描，成本高昂且阻碍部署。需要将3DVG重新定义为主动的、基于记忆的问题。

Method: 提出Mem-ChangingGrounder方法：通过跨模态检索识别查询中的对象类型，检索相关记忆指导行动，在场景中高效探索目标，当先前操作无效时回退，执行目标的多视角扫描，并将多视角扫描的融合证据投影以获得精确的物体边界框。

Result: 在ChangingGrounding基准上评估不同基线，Mem-ChangingGrounder实现了最高的定位精度，同时大大降低了探索成本。

Conclusion: 该基准和方法推动了面向实际应用、以记忆为中心的3DVG研究，为真实世界机器人应用提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Real-world robots localize objects from natural-language instructions while
scenes around them keep changing. Yet most of the existing 3D visual grounding
(3DVG) method still assumes a reconstructed and up-to-date point cloud, an
assumption that forces costly re-scans and hinders deployment. We argue that
3DVG should be formulated as an active, memory-driven problem, and we introduce
ChangingGrounding, the first benchmark that explicitly measures how well an
agent can exploit past observations, explore only where needed, and still
deliver precise 3D boxes in changing scenes. To set a strong reference point,
we also propose Mem-ChangingGrounder, a zero-shot method for this task that
marries cross-modal retrieval with lightweight multi-view fusion: it identifies
the object type implied by the query, retrieves relevant memories to guide
actions, then explores the target efficiently in the scene, falls back when
previous operations are invalid, performs multi-view scanning of the target,
and projects the fused evidence from multi-view scans to get accurate object
bounding boxes. We evaluate different baselines on ChangingGrounding, and our
Mem-ChangingGrounder achieves the highest localization accuracy while greatly
reducing exploration cost. We hope this benchmark and method catalyze a shift
toward practical, memory-centric 3DVG research for real-world applications.

*Hengyuan Xu,Wei Cheng,Peng Xing,Yixiao Fang,Shuhan Wu,Rui Wang,Xianfang Zeng,Daxin Jiang,Gang Yu,Xingjun Ma,Yu-Gang Jiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了WithAnyone模型来解决文本到图像生成中的身份一致性生成问题，通过构建MultiID-2M数据集、引入对比身份损失函数，有效缓解了复制粘贴伪影，在保持身份相似性的同时实现了更好的可控生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖重建式训练，导致模型倾向于直接复制参考面部而非保持身份在姿态、表情或光照等自然变化中的一致性，这种过度相似性削弱了可控性并限制了生成的表现力。

Method: 构建大规模配对数据集MultiID-2M；提出量化复制粘贴伪影和身份保真度与变化权衡的基准；引入基于对比身份损失的新型训练范式，利用配对数据平衡保真度与多样性。

Result: WithAnyone模型显著减少了复制粘贴伪影，提高了姿态和表情的可控性，同时保持了强感知质量。用户研究验证了该方法在实现高身份保真度的同时支持富有表现力的可控生成。

Conclusion: 通过提出的数据集、基准和训练范式，WithAnyone模型在身份一致性生成方面取得了显著进展，有效解决了复制粘贴问题，为文本到图像生成提供了更好的可控性和表现力。

Abstract: Identity-consistent generation has become an important focus in text-to-image
research, with recent models achieving notable success in producing images
aligned with a reference identity. Yet, the scarcity of large-scale paired
datasets containing multiple images of the same individual forces most
approaches to adopt reconstruction-based training. This reliance often leads to
a failure mode we term copy-paste, where the model directly replicates the
reference face rather than preserving identity across natural variations in
pose, expression, or lighting. Such over-similarity undermines controllability
and limits the expressive power of generation. To address these limitations, we
(1) construct a large-scale paired dataset MultiID-2M, tailored for
multi-person scenarios, providing diverse references for each identity; (2)
introduce a benchmark that quantifies both copy-paste artifacts and the
trade-off between identity fidelity and variation; and (3) propose a novel
training paradigm with a contrastive identity loss that leverages paired data
to balance fidelity with diversity. These contributions culminate in
WithAnyone, a diffusion-based model that effectively mitigates copy-paste while
preserving high identity similarity. Extensive qualitative and quantitative
experiments demonstrate that WithAnyone significantly reduces copy-paste
artifacts, improves controllability over pose and expression, and maintains
strong perceptual quality. User studies further validate that our method
achieves high identity fidelity while enabling expressive controllable
generation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Ponimator是一个基于近距离交互姿态的通用交互动画框架，使用两个条件扩散模型分别处理时间先验和空间先验，支持图像驱动交互动画、反应动画和文本到交互合成等任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 近距离人-人交互姿态蕴含丰富的交互动态上下文信息，人类能够基于行为先验直观推断上下文并预测可能的过去和未来动态。

Method: 使用两个条件扩散模型：(1)姿态动画器利用时间先验从交互姿态生成动态运动序列；(2)姿态生成器应用空间先验从单姿态、文本或两者合成交互姿态。

Result: 在多样化数据集和应用上的实证实验证明了姿态先验的普适性以及框架的有效性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: Ponimator能够将高质量动作捕捉数据的交互知识迁移到开放世界场景中，支持多种交互动画任务。

Abstract: Close-proximity human-human interactive poses convey rich contextual
information about interaction dynamics. Given such poses, humans can
intuitively infer the context and anticipate possible past and future dynamics,
drawing on strong priors of human behavior. Inspired by this observation, we
propose Ponimator, a simple framework anchored on proximal interactive poses
for versatile interaction animation. Our training data consists of
close-contact two-person poses and their surrounding temporal context from
motion-capture interaction datasets. Leveraging interactive pose priors,
Ponimator employs two conditional diffusion models: (1) a pose animator that
uses the temporal prior to generate dynamic motion sequences from interactive
poses, and (2) a pose generator that applies the spatial prior to synthesize
interactive poses from a single pose, text, or both when interactive poses are
unavailable. Collectively, Ponimator supports diverse tasks, including
image-based interaction animation, reaction animation, and text-to-interaction
synthesis, facilitating the transfer of interaction knowledge from high-quality
mocap data to open-world scenarios. Empirical experiments across diverse
datasets and applications demonstrate the universality of the pose prior and
the effectiveness and robustness of our framework.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Terra是一个原生3D世界模型，使用内在3D潜在空间表示和生成可探索环境，通过点到高斯变分自编码器和稀疏点流匹配网络实现高3D一致性的世界建模。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有世界模型大多依赖像素对齐表示，忽略了物理世界的固有3D特性，这会损害3D一致性并降低建模效率。

Method: 提出点到高斯变分自编码器(P2G-VAE)将3D输入编码为潜在点表示，然后解码为3D高斯基元；引入稀疏点流匹配网络(SPFlow)生成潜在点表示。

Result: 在ScanNet v2室内场景上的实验表明，Terra在重建和生成方面达到最先进性能，具有高3D一致性。

Conclusion: Terra通过原生3D表示和架构实现了精确的多视角一致性，支持单次生成过程从任意视角灵活渲染，并通过点潜在空间中的渐进生成实现可探索的世界建模。

Abstract: World models have garnered increasing attention for comprehensive modeling of
the real world. However, most existing methods still rely on pixel-aligned
representations as the basis for world evolution, neglecting the inherent 3D
nature of the physical world. This could undermine the 3D consistency and
diminish the modeling efficiency of world models. In this paper, we present
Terra, a native 3D world model that represents and generates explorable
environments in an intrinsic 3D latent space. Specifically, we propose a novel
point-to-Gaussian variational autoencoder (P2G-VAE) that encodes 3D inputs into
a latent point representation, which is subsequently decoded as 3D Gaussian
primitives to jointly model geometry and appearance. We then introduce a sparse
point flow matching network (SPFlow) for generating the latent point
representation, which simultaneously denoises the positions and features of the
point latents. Our Terra enables exact multi-view consistency with native 3D
representation and architecture, and supports flexible rendering from any
viewpoint with only a single generation process. Furthermore, Terra achieves
explorable world modeling through progressive generation in the point latent
space. We conduct extensive experiments on the challenging indoor scenes from
ScanNet v2. Terra achieves state-of-the-art performance in both reconstruction
and generation with high 3D consistency.

TL;DR: 提出无需配对数据的图像编辑训练新范式，通过展开扩散模型并利用视觉语言模型的反馈进行端到端优化，在少步设置下达到与监督学习方法相当的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像编辑模型依赖大规模输入-目标配对数据进行监督微调，但这类自然配对数据难以大规模获取。当前解决方案使用合成训练对，但会传播和放大预训练模型的缺陷。

Method: 直接优化少步扩散模型：训练时展开模型，利用视觉语言模型评估编辑是否遵循指令并保留未改变内容，提供端到端优化的直接梯度。同时结合分布匹配损失确保生成图像保持在预训练模型学习的图像流形内。

Result: 在标准基准测试中，无需任何配对数据的情况下，该方法在少步设置下与使用大量监督配对数据训练的各种图像编辑扩散模型性能相当。使用相同的视觉语言模型作为奖励模型时，也优于基于强化学习的技术如Flow-GRPO。

Conclusion: 该工作证明无需配对数据即可训练高质量图像编辑模型的可行性，通过直接优化和视觉语言模型反馈的新训练范式，克服了监督学习的数据瓶颈问题。

Abstract: Recent image editing models have achieved impressive results while following
natural language editing instructions, but they rely on supervised fine-tuning
with large datasets of input-target pairs. This is a critical bottleneck, as
such naturally occurring pairs are hard to curate at scale. Current workarounds
use synthetic training pairs that leverage the zero-shot capabilities of
existing models. However, this can propagate and magnify the artifacts of the
pretrained model into the final trained model. In this work, we present a new
training paradigm that eliminates the need for paired data entirely. Our
approach directly optimizes a few-step diffusion model by unrolling it during
training and leveraging feedback from vision-language models (VLMs). For each
input and editing instruction, the VLM evaluates if an edit follows the
instruction and preserves unchanged content, providing direct gradients for
end-to-end optimization. To ensure visual fidelity, we incorporate distribution
matching loss (DMD), which constrains generated images to remain within the
image manifold learned by pretrained models. We evaluate our method on standard
benchmarks and include an extensive ablation study. Without any paired data,
our method performs on par with various image editing diffusion models trained
on extensive supervised paired data, under the few-step setting. Given the same
VLM as the reward model, we also outperform RL-based techniques like Flow-GRPO.

TL;DR: 本文提出了NEO，一个基于第一性原理构建的原生视觉语言模型家族，能够与顶级模块化模型在多样化现实场景中竞争。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决原生视觉语言模型面临的两个关键挑战：与模块化模型的根本差异限制，以及如何使原生VLM研究更加普及和民主化。

Method: 基于三个核心原则构建NEO：在共享语义空间中有效对齐像素和词表示；无缝整合视觉和语言模块的优势；内在地体现支持统一视觉语言编码、对齐和推理的跨模态特性。

Result: NEO仅使用3.9亿图像-文本对，就能从零开始高效发展视觉感知，同时在密集单一模型中缓解视觉语言冲突，性能可与顶级模块化模型相媲美。

Conclusion: NEO为可扩展和强大的原生视觉语言模型奠定了基础，提供丰富的可重用组件，促进成本效益高且可扩展的生态系统发展。

Abstract: The edifice of native Vision-Language Models (VLMs) has emerged as a rising
contender to typical modular VLMs, shaped by evolving model architectures and
training paradigms. Yet, two lingering clouds cast shadows over its widespread
exploration and promotion: (-) What fundamental constraints set native VLMs
apart from modular ones, and to what extent can these barriers be overcome? (-)
How to make research in native VLMs more accessible and democratized, thereby
accelerating progress in the field. In this paper, we clarify these challenges
and outline guiding principles for constructing native VLMs. Specifically, one
native VLM primitive should: (i) effectively align pixel and word
representations within a shared semantic space; (ii) seamlessly integrate the
strengths of formerly separate vision and language modules; (iii) inherently
embody various cross-modal properties that support unified vision-language
encoding, aligning, and reasoning. Hence, we launch NEO, a novel family of
native VLMs built from first principles, capable of rivaling top-tier modular
counterparts across diverse real-world scenarios. With only 390M image-text
examples, NEO efficiently develops visual perception from scratch while
mitigating vision-language conflicts inside a dense and monolithic model
crafted from our elaborate primitives. We position NEO as a cornerstone for
scalable and powerful native VLMs, paired with a rich set of reusable
components that foster a cost-effective and extensible ecosystem. Our code and
models are publicly available at: https://github.com/EvolvingLMMs-Lab/NEO.

TL;DR: 提出了一种推理时扩散采样方法，通过隐式3D正则化实现多视图一致的图像编辑，无需显式3D表示优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的2D图像编辑模型在多视图图像编辑时无法保持视图间一致性，而基于显式3D表示的方法存在优化过程冗长、稀疏视图下不稳定的问题。

Method: 采用耦合扩散采样技术，同时从多视图图像分布和2D编辑图像分布中采样两个轨迹，通过耦合项强制生成图像的多视图一致性。

Result: 在三个不同的多视图图像编辑任务上验证了方法的有效性和通用性，适用于各种模型架构。

Conclusion: 该方法作为多视图一致编辑的通用解决方案具有潜力，无需显式3D优化即可实现高质量的多视图一致编辑。

Abstract: We present an inference-time diffusion sampling method to perform multi-view
consistent image editing using pre-trained 2D image editing models. These
models can independently produce high-quality edits for each image in a set of
multi-view images of a 3D scene or object, but they do not maintain consistency
across views. Existing approaches typically address this by optimizing over
explicit 3D representations, but they suffer from a lengthy optimization
process and instability under sparse view settings. We propose an implicit 3D
regularization approach by constraining the generated 2D image sequences to
adhere to a pre-trained multi-view image distribution. This is achieved through
coupled diffusion sampling, a simple diffusion sampling technique that
concurrently samples two trajectories from both a multi-view image distribution
and a 2D edited image distribution, using a coupling term to enforce the
multi-view consistency among the generated images. We validate the
effectiveness and generality of this framework on three distinct multi-view
image editing tasks, demonstrating its applicability across various model
architectures and highlighting its potential as a general solution for
multi-view consistent editing.

*Ashish Kattamuri,Ishita Prasad,Meetu Malhotra,Arpita Vats,Rahul Raja,Albert Lie*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合组相对策略优化(GRPO)和多语言对比奖励信号的新框架，用于提升跨语言Text-to-SQL系统的任务效率和语义准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前Text-to-SQL方法只关注可执行查询，忽略了语义对齐挑战，包括查询语义含义和执行结果正确性。从英语到其他语言时，执行准确率平均下降6个百分点。

Method: 使用GRPO框架结合多语言对比奖励信号，通过基于语义相似度的奖励信号来改善SQL生成与用户意图的对应关系。

Result: 在MultiSpider数据集上，LLaMA-3-3B模型通过GRPO微调，执行准确率提升至87.4%(比零样本+26pp)，语义准确率提升至52.29%(+32.86pp)。加入对比奖励信号后，平均语义准确率进一步提升至59.14%(+6.85pp)。

Conclusion: 使用对比奖励信号进行定向语义对齐可以有效提升Text-to-SQL系统性能，无需大规模训练数据集，较小的3B模型在微调后能超越更大的8B零样本模型。

Abstract: Current Text-to-SQL methods are evaluated and only focused on executable
queries, overlooking the semantic alignment challenge -- both in terms of the
semantic meaning of the query and the correctness of the execution results.
Even execution accuracy itself shows significant drops when moving from English
to other languages, with an average decline of 6 percentage points across
non-English languages. We address these challenges by presenting a new
framework that combines Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) within a
multilingual contrastive reward signal to enhance both task efficiency and
semantic accuracy in Text-to-SQL systems in cross-lingual scenarios. Our method
teaches models to obtain better correspondence between SQL generation and user
intent by combining a reward signal based on semantic similarity. On the
seven-language MultiSpider dataset, fine-tuning the LLaMA-3-3B model with GRPO
improved the execution accuracy up to 87.4 percent (+26 pp over zero-shot) and
semantic accuracy up to 52.29 percent (+32.86 pp). Adding our contrastive
reward signal in the GRPO framework further improved the average semantic
accuracy to 59.14 percent (+6.85 pp, up to +10 pp for Vietnamese). Our
experiments showcase that a smaller, parameter-efficient 3B LLaMA model
fine-tuned with our contrastive reward signal outperforms a much larger
zero-shot 8B LLaMA model, with an uplift of 7.43 pp in execution accuracy (from
81.43 percent on the 8B model to 88.86 percent on the 3B model), and nearly
matches its semantic accuracy (59.14 percent vs. 68.57 percent) -- all using
just 3,000 reinforcement learning training examples. These results demonstrate
how we can improve the performance of Text-to-SQL systems with contrastive
rewards for directed semantic alignment, without requiring large-scale training
datasets.

Motivation: 当前XAI技术（如SHAP和LIME）虽然能产生技术忠实的输出，但无法提供临床相关、可操作的见解，导致实验室到临床的转化障碍。

Method: 提出生成式操作框架，使用LLM作为核心翻译引擎，整合多种XAI工具的技术输出与临床指南（通过RAG），自动生成人类可读、基于证据的临床叙述。

Result: 该框架直接解决了工作流集成、偏见缓解和利益相关者特定沟通等关键操作障碍。

Conclusion: 为领域提供了从生成孤立数据点向交付集成、可操作和可信赖AI的战略路线图，推动AI在临床实践中的应用。

Abstract: Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) has been presented as the critical
component for unlocking the potential of machine learning in mental health
screening (MHS). However, a persistent lab-to-clinic gap remains. Current XAI
techniques, such as SHAP and LIME, excel at producing technically faithful
outputs such as feature importance scores, but fail to deliver clinically
relevant, actionable insights that can be used by clinicians or understood by
patients. This disconnect between technical transparency and human utility is
the primary barrier to real-world adoption. This paper argues that this gap is
a translation problem and proposes the Generative Operational Framework, a
novel system architecture that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) as a
central translation engine. This framework is designed to ingest the raw,
technical outputs from diverse XAI tools and synthesize them with clinical
guidelines (via RAG) to automatically generate human-readable, evidence-backed
clinical narratives. To justify our solution, we provide a systematic analysis
of the components it integrates, tracing the evolution from intrinsic models to
generative XAI. We demonstrate how this framework directly addresses key
operational barriers, including workflow integration, bias mitigation, and
stakeholder-specific communication. This paper also provides a strategic
roadmap for moving the field beyond the generation of isolated data points
toward the delivery of integrated, actionable, and trustworthy AI in clinical
practice.

Motivation: 现有水印方法依赖模型输出分布信号，需要访问模型logits，阻碍了公开验证。需要一种不依赖模型内部信号的水印方法。

Method: 使用词性n-gram建模语言不确定性，在语法约束强的上下文中减弱水印信号以保持文本质量，在语言灵活性强的上下文中增强水印信号以提高可检测性。

Result: 在分析性英语、孤立语中文和粘着语韩语上的实验表明，STELA在检测鲁棒性上优于现有方法，且无需访问模型logits。

Conclusion: STELA通过语言自由度对齐水印强度，实现了公开可验证的水印检测，在不同语言类型上均表现出优越性能。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) continue to advance rapidly, reliable
governance tools have become critical. Publicly verifiable watermarking is
particularly essential for fostering a trustworthy AI ecosystem. A central
challenge persists: balancing text quality against detection robustness. Recent
studies have sought to navigate this trade-off by leveraging signals from model
output distributions (e.g., token-level entropy); however, their reliance on
these model-specific signals presents a significant barrier to public
verification, as the detection process requires access to the logits of the
underlying model. We introduce STELA, a novel framework that aligns watermark
strength with the linguistic degrees of freedom inherent in language. STELA
dynamically modulates the signal using part-of-speech (POS) n-gram-modeled
linguistic indeterminacy, weakening it in grammatically constrained contexts to
preserve quality and strengthen it in contexts with greater linguistic
flexibility to enhance detectability. Our detector operates without access to
any model logits, thus facilitating publicly verifiable detection. Through
extensive experiments on typologically diverse languages-analytic English,
isolating Chinese, and agglutinative Korean-we show that STELA surpasses prior
methods in detection robustness. Our code is available at

Motivation: 传统成对偏好数据依赖专业人工标注，成本高且难以规模化。用户作为自己查询的最佳评判者，但用户标注缺乏质量控制。

Method: 使用两个不同模型生成回答，通过不对称性建立用户行为模型，开发期望最大化算法估计用户潜在质量因子，据此过滤用户标注数据。

Result: 下游任务验证了该方法在捕捉用户行为和LLM对齐数据过滤方面的有效性。

Conclusion: 用户比较模式标注是可行的替代方案，通过质量评估机制可以有效利用用户生成的偏好数据。

Abstract: Pairwise preference data have played an important role in the alignment of
large language models (LLMs). Each sample of such data consists of a prompt,
two different responses to the prompt, and a binary label indicating which of
the two responses is better. The labels are usually annotated by professional
human annotators. In this paper, we consider an alternative approach to collect
pairwise preference data -- user annotation from comparison mode. With the
increasingly wider adoption of LLMs among the population, users are
contributing more and more of their preference labels through their daily
interactions with the LLMs. The upside of such labels is that users are the
best experts in judging the responses to their own queries/prompts, but the
downside is the lack of quality control in these labels. In this paper, we
consider a new idea of generating two responses from two different models or
two different versions of the same model. The asymmetry allows us to make an
inference of the user's data quality through our proposed user behavior model.
We develop an expectation-maximization algorithm to estimate a latent quality
factor of the user, and filter users' annotation data accordingly. The
downstream task shows the effectiveness of our approach in both capturing the
user behavior and data filtering for LLM alignment.

Conclusion: 知情路由通过前瞻性地评估令牌可恢复性，有效解决了贪婪路由的信息丢失问题，为LLMs的高效部署提供了新思路。

Abstract: The deployment of large language models (LLMs) in real-world applications is
increasingly limited by their high inference cost. While recent advances in
dynamic token-level computation allocation attempt to improve efficiency by
selectively activating model components per token, existing methods rely on
greedy routing--a myopic execute-or-skip mechanism that often leads to
irreversible information loss and suboptimal token selection. This paper
introduces informed routing, a new paradigm that proactively addresses these
issues. The key insight is to assess not only a token's immediate importance
but also its recoverability, i.e., how well its transformation can be
approximated. To this end, we propose the Lightweight Feature Forecaster (LFF),
a small predictive module that estimates a unit's output before routing
decisions are made. This enables a flexible execute-or-approximate policy that
preserves model fidelity while drastically reducing computation. Extensive
experiments on both language modeling and reasoning tasks show that informed
routing achieves state-of-the-art efficiency-performance trade-offs across
multiple sparsity levels. Notably, even without final LoRA fine-tuning, our
method matches or surpasses strong baselines that require full fine-tuning, all
while reducing training time by over 50%. The code is available at:

Conclusion: HIES方法有效克服了HIS的局限性，通过结合重要性分数和注意力熵实现了更好的剪枝效果。

Abstract: Transformer-based models have achieved remarkable performance in NLP tasks.
However, their structural characteristics-multiple layers and attention
heads-introduce efficiency challenges in inference and deployment. To address
these challenges, various pruning methods have recently been proposed. Notably,
gradient-based methods using Head Importance Scores (HIS) have gained traction
for interpretability, efficiency, and ability to identify redundant heads.
However, HIS alone has limitations as it captures only the gradient-driven
contribution, overlooking the diversity of attention patterns. To overcome
these limitations, we introduce a novel pruning criterion, HIES (Head
Importance-Entropy Score), which integrates head importance scores with
attention entropy, providing complementary evidence on per-head contribution.
Empirically, HIES-based pruning yields up to 15.2% improvement in model quality
and 2.04x improvement in stability over HIS-only methods, enabling substantial
model compression without sacrificing either accuracy or stability. Code will
be released upon publication.

TL;DR: ConDABench是一个用于生成对话式数据分析基准测试的框架，包含多智能体工作流、1420个对话式数据分析问题以及评估工具，旨在评估LLM在复杂交互式数据分析任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界的数据分析任务通常目标不明确且数据不干净，需要用户交互来理解和澄清用户意图。现有的LLM评估基准无法捕捉这些复杂性或提供对交互性的原生支持。

Method: 使用多智能体工作流从描述公共数据集洞察的文章中生成真实基准测试，创建了1420个对话式数据分析问题，并开发了评估工具来系统评估对话式数据分析工具。

Result: 评估显示新一代LLM虽然能解决更多实例，但在需要持续、长形式交互的任务上表现并不更好。

Conclusion: ConDABench为模型构建者提供了一个衡量真正协作模型在完成复杂交互任务方面进展的途径。

Abstract: Real-world data analysis tasks often come with under-specified goals and
unclean data. User interaction is necessary to understand and disambiguate a
user's intent, and hence, essential to solving these complex tasks. Existing
benchmarks for evaluating LLMs on data analysis tasks do not capture these
complexities or provide first-class support for interactivity. We introduce
ConDABench, a framework for generating conversational data analysis (ConDA)
benchmarks and evaluating external tools on the generated benchmarks. \bench
consists of (a) a multi-agent workflow for generating realistic benchmarks from
articles describing insights gained from public datasets, (b) 1,420 ConDA
problems generated using this workflow, and (c) an evaluation harness that, for
the first time, makes it possible to systematically evaluate conversational
data analysis tools on the generated ConDA problems. Evaluation of
state-of-the-art LLMs on the benchmarks reveals that while the new generation
of models are better at solving more instances, they are not necessarily better
at solving tasks that require sustained, long-form engagement. ConDABench is an
avenue for model builders to measure progress towards truly collaborative
models that can complete complex interactive tasks.

Motivation: 不确定性量化对于可信AI系统至关重要，黑盒方法具有鲁棒性、适应性强、成本低等现实优势，需要研究LLM何时知道自己的未知领域。

Method: 提出了基于相似性的非语言化聚合框架，包含多种适用于复杂生成任务的UQ方法，并引入了使用小训练集训练置信度估计模型的新技术。

Result: 在问答、摘要和文本转SQL等多样化任务上的实证研究表明，提出的基于相似性方法比基线方法能产生更好校准的置信度。

Conclusion: 基于相似性的黑盒不确定性量化方法在多种生成任务中有效，能够为LLM输出提供更可靠的置信度估计。

Abstract: When does a large language model (LLM) know what it does not know?
Uncertainty quantification (UQ) provides measures of uncertainty, such as an
estimate of the confidence in an LLM's generated output, and is therefore
increasingly recognized as a crucial component of trusted AI systems. Black-box
UQ methods do not require access to internal model information from the
generating LLM and therefore have numerous real-world advantages, such as
robustness to system changes, adaptability to choice of LLM, reduced costs, and
computational tractability. In this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of
UQ techniques that are primarily but not necessarily entirely black-box, where
the consistency between a generated output and other sampled generations is
used as a proxy for confidence in its correctness. We propose a high-level
non-verbalized similarity-based aggregation framework that subsumes a broad
swath of UQ approaches suitable for complex generative tasks, as well as
introduce specific novel techniques from the framework that train confidence
estimation models using small training sets. Through an empirical study with
datasets spanning the diverse tasks of question answering, summarization, and
text-to-SQL, we demonstrate that our proposed similarity-based methods can
yield better calibrated confidences than baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有仇恨言论检测方法忽视了现实世界的复杂性：训练标签存在偏见，且不同文化背景的个体对仇恨言论的定义存在差异。

Method: 构建文化感知框架，通过建模文化属性组合来缓解数据稀疏性，使用标签传播捕捉每个组合的独特特征，最终构建个体仇恨子空间。

Result: 实验表明该方法在所有指标上平均优于最先进方法1.05%。

Conclusion: 提出的文化感知框架能有效处理仇恨言论检测中的数据稀疏性、文化纠缠和标签模糊问题，并通过个体仇恨子空间进一步提升分类性能。

Abstract: Hate speech detection has been extensively studied, yet existing methods
often overlook a real-world complexity: training labels are biased, and
interpretations of what is considered hate vary across individuals with
different cultural backgrounds. We first analyze these challenges, including
data sparsity, cultural entanglement, and ambiguous labeling. To address them,
we propose a culture-aware framework that constructs individuals' hate
subspaces. To alleviate data sparsity, we model combinations of cultural
attributes. For cultural entanglement and ambiguous labels, we use label
propagation to capture distinctive features of each combination. Finally,
individual hate subspaces, which in turn can further enhance classification
performance. Experiments show our method outperforms state-of-the-art by 1.05\%
on average across all metrics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手动构建本体耗时耗力且成本高昂，而现有的大量非结构化文本需要有效的组织方式，特别是在电子商务领域需要处理海量产品列表。

Method: 利用大语言模型的最新进展，开发了从原始评论文本中全自动提取产品本体的方法，以部分-整体关系的形式表示。

Result: 该方法产生的本体在使用LLM作为评判者的评估中，超越了现有的基于BERT的基线方法。

Conclusion: 这项研究为在大语言模型更广泛地应用于产品或其他领域的本体提取奠定了基础。

Abstract: Ontologies have become essential in today's digital age as a way of
organising the vast amount of readily available unstructured text. In providing
formal structure to this information, ontologies have immense value and
application across various domains, e.g., e-commerce, where countless product
listings necessitate proper product organisation. However, the manual
construction of these ontologies is a time-consuming, expensive and laborious
process. In this paper, we harness the recent advancements in large language
models (LLMs) to develop a fully-automated method of extracting product
ontologies, in the form of meronymies, from raw review texts. We demonstrate
that the ontologies produced by our method surpass an existing, BERT-based
baseline when evaluating using an LLM-as-a-judge. Our investigation provides
the groundwork for LLMs to be used more generally in (product or otherwise)
ontology extraction.

TL;DR: ADMIT是一种针对RAG系统的事实检查场景的少样本知识投毒攻击方法，能够在极低投毒率下有效翻转事实检查决策并诱导欺骗性解释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究真实世界事实检查场景中的知识投毒威胁，因为在真实场景中可信证据通常主导检索结果，这比之前研究的误导性内容更具挑战性。

Method: 提出ADMIT攻击方法，这是一种少样本、语义对齐的投毒技术，无需访问目标LLM、检索器或令牌级控制，通过注入对抗性内容来操纵事实检查结果。

Result: 在4个检索器、11个LLM和4个跨领域基准测试中，ADMIT在极低投毒率(0.93×10^-6)下平均攻击成功率达到86%，且在面对强反证据时仍保持鲁棒性。

Conclusion: ADMIT相比之前最先进攻击方法在所有设置下提升11.2%的攻击成功率，揭示了现实世界基于RAG的事实检查系统的严重脆弱性。

Abstract: Knowledge poisoning poses a critical threat to Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) systems by injecting adversarial content into knowledge bases, tricking
Large Language Models (LLMs) into producing attacker-controlled outputs
grounded in manipulated context. Prior work highlights LLMs' susceptibility to
misleading or malicious retrieved content. However, real-world fact-checking
scenarios are more challenging, as credible evidence typically dominates the
retrieval pool. To investigate this problem, we extend knowledge poisoning to
the fact-checking setting, where retrieved context includes authentic
supporting or refuting evidence. We propose \textbf{ADMIT}
(\textbf{AD}versarial \textbf{M}ulti-\textbf{I}njection \textbf{T}echnique), a
few-shot, semantically aligned poisoning attack that flips fact-checking
decisions and induces deceptive justifications, all without access to the
target LLMs, retrievers, or token-level control. Extensive experiments show
that ADMIT transfers effectively across 4 retrievers, 11 LLMs, and 4
cross-domain benchmarks, achieving an average attack success rate (ASR) of 86\%
at an extremely low poisoning rate of $0.93 \times 10^{-6}$, and remaining
robust even in the presence of strong counter-evidence. Compared with prior
state-of-the-art attacks, ADMIT improves ASR by 11.2\% across all settings,
exposing significant vulnerabilities in real-world RAG-based fact-checking
systems.

TL;DR: SerialBEHRT是一个针对电子健康记录(EHR)的领域对齐基础模型，通过额外的结构化EHR序列预训练扩展SciBERT，能够编码临床事件间的时序和上下文关系，在抗生素敏感性预测任务上表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以协调EHR的表格和事件性质与自然语言模型的序列先验之间的结构不匹配，这限制了它们捕捉患者就诊间纵向依赖关系的能力。

Method: 通过额外的结构化EHR序列预训练扩展SciBERT，设计SerialBEHRT模型来编码临床事件间的时序和上下文关系。

Result: 在抗生素敏感性预测任务上，SerialBEHRT相比最先进的EHR表示策略实现了更优越和更一致的性能。

Conclusion: 研究强调了在医疗基础模型预训练中时序序列化的重要性，SerialBEHRT能够产生更丰富的患者表示。

Abstract: The emergence of foundation models in healthcare has opened new avenues for
learning generalizable representations from large scale clinical data. Yet,
existing approaches often struggle to reconcile the tabular and event based
nature of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) with the sequential priors of
natural language models. This structural mismatch limits their ability to
capture longitudinal dependencies across patient encounters. We introduce
SerialBEHRT, a domain aligned foundation model that extends SciBERT through
additional pretraining on structured EHR sequences. SerialBEHRT is designed to
encode temporal and contextual relationships among clinical events, thereby
producing richer patient representations. We evaluate its effectiveness on the
task of antibiotic susceptibility prediction, a clinically meaningful problem
in antibiotic stewardship. Through extensive benchmarking against state of the
art EHR representation strategies, we demonstrate that SerialBEHRT achieves
superior and more consistent performance, highlighting the importance of
temporal serialization in foundation model pretraining for healthcare.

*Jinbin Zhang,Nasib Ullah,Erik Schultheis,Rohit Babbar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DynaSpec是一种上下文相关的动态短列表机制，通过轻量级元分类器将上下文路由到少量token簇中，解决了传统固定词汇表子集方法在推测解码中的局限性，提高了接受长度并加速了起草过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统推测解码方法使用固定词汇表子集作为起草者的词汇表，这种方法存在两个问题：(1) 频率列表依赖于语料库且需要重新调优才能泛化；(2) 静态短列表抑制了稀有或领域特定token，降低了每个验证步骤的预期token数量。

Method: 提出轻量级、粗粒度的元分类器，将上下文路由到少量token簇中；选定的前k个簇的并集形成起草者的短列表，而验证保留完整词汇表和精确性。元分类器通过在不同流上并行执行起草编码和元短列表来提前完成计算。

Result: 在标准推测解码基准测试中，相比固定短列表基线，观察到平均接受长度的一致增益，同时上下文相关选择使得能够使用更小的短列表而不会降低接受率。

Conclusion: DynaSpec提供了一种稳健、加速起草并能跨不同任务泛化的上下文相关动态短列表机制，解决了传统固定词汇表方法的局限性。

Abstract: Speculative decoding (a.k.a. speculative sampling) has become a standard way
to accelerate LLM inference: a small drafter proposes multiple tokens and a
large target model verifies them once per speculation length. Recently, scaling
of the LLM vocabulary has pushed the number of tokens to grow substantially.
While verification over the full vocabulary leaves the target model largely
unaffected, the O(|V|d) parameters in the drafter's output head become a
latency bottleneck, slowing the entire pipeline. Contemporary methods (e.g.,
FR-Spec, VocabTrim) restrict the drafter's vocabulary to a fixed subset of the
target model's vocabulary, ranked in descending order of token frequency.
Although this reduces draft-time compute, it is brittle, since: (i) frequency
lists are corpus-dependent and require retuning to generalize, and (ii) static
shortlists suppress rare or domain-specific tokens, lowering the expected
number of tokens per verification step. We propose DynaSpec, a
context-dependent dynamic shortlisting mechanism that is robust, speeds up
drafting, and generalizes across diverse tasks. Concretely, we introduce
lightweight, coarse-grained meta-classifiers that route contexts to a small
number of token clusters; the union of the top-k selected clusters forms the
drafter's shortlist, while verification retains the full vocabulary and
exactness. The meta-classifier finishes its computation earlier than the
drafter's hidden state generation by exploiting parallel execution of draft
encoding and meta shortlisting on separate streams. On standard
speculative-decoding benchmarks, we observe consistent gains in mean accepted
length over fixed-shortlist baselines, while context-dependent selection
enables smaller shortlists without degrading acceptance.

Motivation: 标准参数高效微调方法在处理复杂组合任务（如从长对话生成翻译摘要）时表现不佳，需要专门解决方案。

Method: 在组合的摘要和翻译适配器上添加可学习投影层，实现有效集成同时保持计算效率。

Result: 实验表明该方法在云端和设备上都能良好运行且速度快，开发了能够无缝执行组合任务的Android应用。

Conclusion: 该方法在现实应用中具有潜力，特别是在需要高速操作和资源受限的场景下。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are commonly adapted for diverse downstream
tasks via parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques such as Low-Rank Adapters
(LoRA). While adapters can be combined to handle multiple tasks separately,
standard approaches struggle when targeting the simultaneous execution of
complex tasks, such as generating a translated summary from a long
conversation. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach tailored
specifically for compositional multi-tasking scenarios involving summarization
and translation. Our technique involves adding a learnable projection layer on
top of the combined summarization and translation adapters. This design enables
effective integration while maintaining efficiency through reduced
computational overhead compared to alternative strategies requiring extensive
retraining or sequential processing. We demonstrate the practical viability of
our method within an on-device environment by developing an Android app capable
of executing compositional tasks seamlessly. Experimental results indicate our
solution performs well and is fast in both cloud-based and on-device
implementations, highlighting the potential benefits of adopting our framework
in real-world applications demanding high-speed operation alongside resource
constraints.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于LLM的代理检索系统，通过三个专门代理（问题分析器、选择器和添加器）的协同工作，在多跳问答任务中实现高精度和高召回率的证据检索。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多跳问答需要收集多个证据片段，传统检索方法在精度和召回率方面存在局限，需要更智能的检索系统来提高证据收集效率。

Method: 使用三个专门代理：问题分析器分解多跳问题为子问题，选择器为每个子问题选择最相关上下文（侧重精度），添加器补充缺失证据（侧重召回率），通过选择器和添加器的迭代交互获得紧凑而全面的支持段落。

Result: 在四个多跳问答基准测试（HotpotQA、2WikiMultiHopQA、MuSiQue和MultiHopRAG）上，该方法持续优于强基线模型，实现了更高的检索准确率，同时过滤掉干扰内容。

Conclusion: 该代理检索系统能够显著提高多跳问答的检索性能，使下游QA模型在依赖较少无关信息的情况下超越全上下文答案准确率。

Abstract: Retrieval plays a central role in multi-hop question answering (QA), where
answering complex questions requires gathering multiple pieces of evidence. We
introduce an Agentic Retrieval System that leverages large language models
(LLMs) in a structured loop to retrieve relevant evidence with high precision
and recall. Our framework consists of three specialized agents: a Question
Analyzer that decomposes a multi-hop question into sub-questions, a Selector
that identifies the most relevant context for each sub-question (focusing on
precision), and an Adder that brings in any missing evidence (focusing on
recall). The iterative interaction between Selector and Adder yields a compact
yet comprehensive set of supporting passages. In particular, it achieves higher
retrieval accuracy while filtering out distracting content, enabling downstream
QA models to surpass full-context answer accuracy while relying on
significantly less irrelevant information. Experiments on four multi-hop QA
benchmarks -- HotpotQA, 2WikiMultiHopQA, MuSiQue, and MultiHopRAG --
demonstrates that our approach consistently outperforms strong baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多语言大语言模型经常出现无意的代码切换现象，降低了在下游任务中的可靠性。

Method: 使用PCA在平行翻译数据上识别语言方向，然后沿着这些轴引导token嵌入来控制语言身份，该方法计算开销极小且仅需少量平行数据进行校准。

Result: 使用单个主成分实现了95-99%的语言分类准确率，在Qwen2.5和Llama-3.2模型上，多个语言对的下一token分布差异减少了高达42%。

Conclusion: 语言身份表征集中在最终层，具有近乎完美的线性可分性，该方法能有效缓解代码切换问题同时保持语义完整性。

Abstract: Multilingual Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit unintended
code-switching, reducing reliability in downstream tasks. We propose
latent-space language steering, a lightweight inference-time method that
identifies language directions via PCA on parallel translations and steers
token embeddings along these axes to control language identity. Our approach
mitigates code-switching while preserving semantics with negligible
computational overhead and requires only minimal parallel data for calibration.
Empirically, we achieve 95-99\% language classification accuracy using a single
principal component and reduce next-token distributional divergence by up to
42% across multiple language pairs on Qwen2.5 and Llama-3.2 models. We further
analyze the layer-wise evolution of language representations, revealing that
language identity concentrates in final layers with near-perfect linear
separability.

TL;DR: 提出了一个上下文感知的双向模式检索框架，将模式链接作为独立问题处理，显著提升Text-to-SQL系统的准确性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 模式链接是Text-to-SQL系统中关键但研究不足的组件，现有方法主要关注SQL生成而忽视相关模式元素的检索，导致幻觉和执行失败。

Method: 采用双向模式检索框架，结合表优先检索后列选择和列优先检索后表选择两种互补策略，并辅以问题分解、关键词提取和关键短语提取技术。

Result: 在BIRD和Spider等基准测试中显著提高模式召回率并减少误报，SQL生成性能超过全模式基线并接近oracle性能，将完整模式和完美模式之间的性能差距缩小50%。

Conclusion: 模式链接是提升Text-to-SQL准确性和效率的有力杠杆，无需查询优化即可实现接近最优性能。

Abstract: Schema linking -- the process of aligning natural language questions with
database schema elements -- is a critical yet underexplored component of
Text-to-SQL systems. While recent methods have focused primarily on improving
SQL generation, they often neglect the retrieval of relevant schema elements,
which can lead to hallucinations and execution failures. In this work, we
propose a context-aware bidirectional schema retrieval framework that treats
schema linking as a standalone problem. Our approach combines two complementary
strategies: table-first retrieval followed by column selection, and
column-first retrieval followed by table selection. It is further augmented
with techniques such as question decomposition, keyword extraction, and
keyphrase extraction. Through comprehensive evaluations on challenging
benchmarks such as BIRD and Spider, we demonstrate that our method
significantly improves schema recall while reducing false positives. Moreover,
SQL generation using our retrieved schema consistently outperforms full-schema
baselines and closely approaches oracle performance, all without requiring
query refinement. Notably, our method narrows the performance gap between full
and perfect schema settings by 50\%. Our findings highlight schema linking as a
powerful lever for enhancing Text-to-SQL accuracy and efficiency.

TL;DR: 研究发现LLMs成功推理时的信息密度呈现不均匀波动，与人类沟通模式相反，挑战了机器推理的假设。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受心理语言学中均匀信息密度假说的启发，分析LLM推理过程中的信息流，因为现有CoT推理的中间步骤常常不忠实或难以解释。

Method: 引入基于熵的指标来分析推理轨迹中的信息流，在三个数学基准测试上进行研究。

Result: 在三个数学基准测试中发现，LLMs成功推理时的信息密度呈现全局不均匀性，正确解的特征是信息密度的不均匀波动。

Conclusion: 这一结果挑战了关于机器推理的假设，并为设计可解释和自适应推理模型提供了新方向。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often solve problems using step-by-step
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, yet these intermediate steps are frequently
unfaithful or hard to interpret. Inspired by the Uniform Information Density
(UID) hypothesis in psycholinguistics -- which posits that humans communicate
by maintaining a stable flow of information -- we introduce entropy-based
metrics to analyze the information flow within reasoning traces. Surprisingly,
across three challenging mathematical benchmarks, we find that successful
reasoning in LLMs is globally non-uniform: correct solutions are characterized
by uneven swings in information density, in stark contrast to human
communication patterns. This result challenges assumptions about machine
reasoning and suggests new directions for designing interpretable and adaptive
reasoning models.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了pluri-hop问题的新概念，针对需要跨所有文档聚合信息的问答场景，并开发了PluriHopWIND数据集和PluriHopRAG方法来解决传统RAG在重复性、干扰性文档丰富的语料库中的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有问答系统在处理需要跨所有文档聚合信息的现实问题时存在不足，特别是当语料库包含大量重复和干扰文档时，传统RAG方法表现不佳。

Method: 提出了PluriHopRAG方法，采用"逐个检查所有文档，廉价过滤"的策略：将查询分解为文档级子问题，使用交叉编码器过滤器在昂贵的LLM推理前丢弃无关文档。

Result: PluriHopRAG在语句级F1分数上实现了18-52%的相对改进，而传统RAG方法均未超过40%的F1分数。

Conclusion: PluriHopWIND数据集揭示了当前问答系统在重复性、干扰性文档丰富语料库上的局限性，PluriHopRAG的性能证明了穷尽检索和早期过滤作为top-k方法替代方案的价值。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG) have enabled progress on question answering (QA) when relevant
evidence is in one (single-hop) or multiple (multi-hop) passages. Yet many
realistic questions about recurring report data - medical records, compliance
filings, maintenance logs - require aggregation across all documents, with no
clear stopping point for retrieval and high sensitivity to even one missed
passage. We term these pluri-hop questions and formalize them by three
criteria: recall sensitivity, exhaustiveness, and exactness. To study this
setting, we introduce PluriHopWIND, a diagnostic multilingual dataset of 48
pluri-hop questions built from 191 real-world wind industry reports in German
and English. We show that PluriHopWIND is 8-40% more repetitive than other
common datasets and thus has higher density of distractor documents, better
reflecting practical challenges of recurring report corpora. We test a
traditional RAG pipeline as well as graph-based and multimodal variants, and
find that none of the tested approaches exceed 40% in statement-wise F1 score.
Motivated by this, we propose PluriHopRAG, a RAG architecture that follows a
"check all documents individually, filter cheaply" approach: it (i) decomposes
queries into document-level subquestions and (ii) uses a cross-encoder filter
to discard irrelevant documents before costly LLM reasoning. We find that
PluriHopRAG achieves relative F1 score improvements of 18-52% depending on base
LLM. Despite its modest size, PluriHopWIND exposes the limitations of current
QA systems on repetitive, distractor-rich corpora. PluriHopRAG's performance
highlights the value of exhaustive retrieval and early filtering as a powerful
alternative to top-k methods.

TL;DR: EvoEdit是一种新的模型编辑策略，通过顺序零空间对齐来缓解灾难性干扰，实现稳定高效的LLM编辑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于定位-编辑框架的方法在连续编辑场景中存在灾难性干扰问题，新编辑会损害之前的知识更新。

Method: 采用顺序零空间对齐技术，为每个新编辑执行零空间对齐，保留原始和先前修改的知识表示。

Result: 在真实世界顺序知识编辑基准测试中，EvoEdit达到或优于现有最优方法，速度提升达3.53倍。

Conclusion: EvoEdit为动态演化信息环境中的LLM设计提供了简单有效且具有理论保证的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) require continual updates to rectify outdated or
erroneous knowledge. Model editing has emerged as a compelling paradigm for
introducing targeted modifications without the computational burden of full
retraining. Existing approaches are mainly based on a locate-then-edit
framework. However, in sequential editing contexts, where multiple updates are
applied over time, they exhibit significant limitations and suffer from
catastrophic interference, i.e., new edits compromise previously integrated
updates and degrade preserved knowledge. To address these challenges, we
introduce EvoEdit, a novel editing strategy that mitigates catastrophic
interference through sequential null-space alignment, enabling stable and
efficient model editing. By performing sequential null-space alignment for each
incoming edit, EvoEdit preserves both original and previously modified
knowledge representations and maintains output invariance on preserved
knowledge even across long edit sequences, effectively mitigating interference.
Evaluations on real-world sequential knowledge-editing benchmarks show that
EvoEdit achieves better or comparable performance than prior state-of-the-art
locate-then-edit techniques, with up to 3.53 times speedup. Overall, these
results underscore the necessity of developing more principled approaches for
designing LLMs in dynamically evolving information settings, while providing a
simple yet effective solution with strong theoretical guarantees.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出MedTrust-Guided Iterative RAG框架，通过引用感知推理、迭代检索验证和MedTrust对齐模块，有效减少医疗问答中的幻觉问题，在多个基准测试中显著提升准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于RAG的医疗问答系统存在幻觉问题，主要由于检索后噪声和证据验证不足，影响回答的可靠性。

Method: 1) 引用感知推理，要求所有生成内容必须基于检索的医疗文档；2) 迭代检索验证过程，通过验证代理评估证据充分性并优化查询；3) MedTrust对齐模块，结合验证的正例和幻觉感知负例，使用直接偏好优化强化基于引用的推理。

Result: 在MedMCQA、MedQA和MMLU-Med基准测试中，该方法在多个模型架构上均优于竞争基线，LLaMA3.1-8B-Instruct和Qwen3-8B分别获得2.7%和2.4%的平均准确率提升。

Conclusion: MedTrust-Guided Iterative RAG框架通过系统性的幻觉缓解机制，显著提升了医疗问答的事实一致性和可靠性。

Abstract: Biomedical question answering (QA) requires accurate interpretation of
complex medical knowledge. Large language models (LLMs) have shown promising
capabilities in this domain, with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems
enhancing performance by incorporating external medical literature. However,
RAG-based approaches in biomedical QA suffer from hallucinations due to
post-retrieval noise and insufficient verification of retrieved evidence,
undermining response reliability. We propose MedTrust-Guided Iterative RAG, a
framework designed to enhance factual consistency and mitigate hallucinations
in medical QA. Our method introduces three key innovations. First, it enforces
citation-aware reasoning by requiring all generated content to be explicitly
grounded in retrieved medical documents, with structured Negative Knowledge
Assertions used when evidence is insufficient. Second, it employs an iterative
retrieval-verification process, where a verification agent assesses evidence
adequacy and refines queries through Medical Gap Analysis until reliable
information is obtained. Third, it integrates the MedTrust-Align Module (MTAM)
that combines verified positive examples with hallucination-aware negative
samples, leveraging Direct Preference Optimization to reinforce
citation-grounded reasoning while penalizing hallucination-prone response
patterns. Experiments on MedMCQA, MedQA, and MMLU-Med demonstrate that our
approach consistently outperforms competitive baselines across multiple model
architectures, achieving the best average accuracy with gains of 2.7% for
LLaMA3.1-8B-Instruct and 2.4% for Qwen3-8B.

*Peter Banyas,Shristi Sharma,Alistair Simmons,Atharva Vispute*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ConsistencyAI是一个独立基准，用于衡量大型语言模型对不同人物角色的回答事实一致性，发现不同模型在事实一致性上存在显著差异，且一致性程度受提供商和话题影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估当不同人口统计特征的用户提出相同问题时，LLM是否会产生事实不一致的回答，提供公正的评估和问责机制。

Method: 对19个LLM进行测试，每个模型针对15个话题请求5个事实，重复100次，每次添加不同人物角色上下文，通过计算跨人物角色的余弦相似度加权平均值来评估事实一致性。

Result: 在100个人物角色实验中，一致性得分范围从0.9065到0.7896，平均值为0.8656（作为基准阈值）。Grok-3最一致，多个轻量级模型排名最低。不同话题的一致性差异显著：就业市场最不一致，G7世界领导人最一致。

Conclusion: LLM的事实一致性既受提供商影响，也受话题影响，需要开发人物角色不变的提示策略来改善一致性。

Abstract: Is an LLM telling you different facts than it's telling me? This paper
introduces ConsistencyAI, an independent benchmark for measuring the factual
consistency of large language models (LLMs) for different personas.
ConsistencyAI tests whether, when users of different demographics ask identical
questions, the model responds with factually inconsistent answers. Designed
without involvement from LLM providers, this benchmark offers impartial
evaluation and accountability. In our experiment, we queried 19 LLMs with
prompts that requested 5 facts for each of 15 topics. We repeated this query
100 times for each LLM, each time adding prompt context from a different
persona selected from a subset of personas modeling the general population. We
processed the responses into sentence embeddings, computed cross-persona cosine
similarity, and computed the weighted average of cross-persona cosine
similarity to calculate factual consistency scores. In 100-persona experiments,
scores ranged from 0.9065 to 0.7896, and the mean was 0.8656, which we adopt as
a benchmark threshold. xAI's Grok-3 is most consistent, while several
lightweight models rank lowest. Consistency varies by topic: the job market is
least consistent, G7 world leaders most consistent, and issues like vaccines or
the Israeli-Palestinian conflict diverge by provider. These results show that
both the provider and the topic shape the factual consistency. We release our
code and interactive demo to support reproducible evaluation and encourage
persona-invariant prompting strategies.

TL;DR: 提出了BenchPress系统，通过检索增强生成和LLMs自动生成自然语言描述，结合人工验证来加速领域特定text-to-SQL基准的创建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有text-to-SQL研究主要关注公开数据集，但在私有企业数据仓库中效果较差。手动标注SQL日志成本高昂，需要解决领域特定基准创建困难的问题。

Method: 使用检索增强生成和LLMs为给定SQL查询生成多个自然语言描述，然后由人类专家选择、排序或编辑这些草稿以确保准确性和领域对齐。

Result: 在标注的企业SQL日志上评估表明，LLM辅助标注大幅减少了创建高质量基准所需的时间和精力，提高了标注准确性、基准可靠性和模型评估鲁棒性。

Conclusion: BenchPress通过结合人工验证和LLM生成建议，为研究人员和从业者提供了评估领域特定工作负载上text-to-SQL模型的机制。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been successfully applied to many tasks,
including text-to-SQL generation. However, much of this work has focused on
publicly available datasets, such as Fiben, Spider, and Bird. Our earlier work
showed that LLMs are much less effective in querying large private enterprise
data warehouses and released Beaver, the first private enterprise text-to-SQL
benchmark. To create Beaver, we leveraged SQL logs, which are often readily
available. However, manually annotating these logs to identify which natural
language questions they answer is a daunting task. Asking database
administrators, who are highly trained experts, to take on additional work to
construct and validate corresponding natural language utterances is not only
challenging but also quite costly. To address this challenge, we introduce
BenchPress, a human-in-the-loop system designed to accelerate the creation of
domain-specific text-to-SQL benchmarks. Given a SQL query, BenchPress uses
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and LLMs to propose multiple natural
language descriptions. Human experts then select, rank, or edit these drafts to
ensure accuracy and domain alignment. We evaluated BenchPress on annotated
enterprise SQL logs, demonstrating that LLM-assisted annotation drastically
reduces the time and effort required to create high-quality benchmarks. Our
results show that combining human verification with LLM-generated suggestions
enhances annotation accuracy, benchmark reliability, and model evaluation
robustness. By streamlining the creation of custom benchmarks, BenchPress
offers researchers and practitioners a mechanism for assessing text-to-SQL
models on a given domain-specific workload. BenchPress is freely available via
our public GitHub repository at
https://github.com/fabian-wenz/enterprise-txt2sql and is also accessible on our

*Yinxi Li,Yuntian Deng,Pengyu Nie*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出TokDrift框架，通过语义保持的代码重写规则创建仅tokenization不同的代码变体，发现即使微小的格式变化也会导致代码LLMs行为显著变化，揭示了子词分词与语法不对齐是代码理解可靠性的隐藏障碍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前代码LLMs使用基于统计的子词分词器（如BPE），而非基于语法，导致语义相同的代码片段可能因空格或标识符命名等表面因素而被不同分词，影响模型可靠性。

Method: 引入TokDrift框架，应用语义保持的重写规则生成仅tokenization不同的代码变体，在9个代码LLMs（包括超过300亿参数的大模型）上进行测试，并进行分层分析。

Result: 即使微小的格式变化也会导致模型行为显著变化，分层分析显示问题源于早期嵌入层，子词分词未能捕获语法标记边界。

Conclusion: 分词不对齐是代码理解和生成的隐藏障碍，未来代码LLMs需要语法感知的分词方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) for code rely on subword tokenizers, such as
byte-pair encoding (BPE), learned from mixed natural language text and
programming language code but driven by statistics rather than grammar. As a
result, semantically identical code snippets can be tokenized differently
depending on superficial factors such as whitespace or identifier naming. To
measure the impact of this misalignment, we introduce TokDrift, a framework
that applies semantic-preserving rewrite rules to create code variants
differing only in tokenization. Across nine code LLMs, including large ones
with over 30B parameters, even minor formatting changes can cause substantial
shifts in model behavior. Layer-wise analysis shows that the issue originates
in early embeddings, where subword segmentation fails to capture grammar token
boundaries. Our findings identify misaligned tokenization as a hidden obstacle
to reliable code understanding and generation, highlighting the need for
grammar-aware tokenization for future code LLMs.

TL;DR: R2T框架将语言规则融入神经网络训练目标，通过自适应损失函数处理OOV词汇，在无标注文本上训练即可达到98.2%的POS标注准确率，优于基于300标注句子的AfriBERTa。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提出原则性学习范式，让模型通过明确的约束而非仅靠标注数据进行训练，特别针对低资源语言处理问题。

Method: R2T框架结合多层级语言规则和神经网络，使用包含正则化项的自适应损失函数来处理OOV词汇的不确定性。

Result: 在Zarma语POS标注任务中，仅使用无标注文本训练的R2T-BiLSTM模型达到98.2%准确率；在NER任务中，R2T预训练后仅用50标注句子微调即可超越基于300标注句子的基线模型。

Conclusion: R2T框架在低资源场景下表现出色，证明了原则性学习范式的有效性，为资源匮乏语言的处理提供了新思路。

Abstract: We introduce the Rule-to-Tag (R2T) framework, a hybrid approach that
integrates a multi-tiered system of linguistic rules directly into a neural
network's training objective. R2T's novelty lies in its adaptive loss function,
which includes a regularization term that teaches the model to handle
out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words with principled uncertainty. We frame this work
as a case study in a paradigm we call principled learning (PrL), where models
are trained with explicit task constraints rather than on labeled examples
alone. Our experiments on Zarma part-of-speech (POS) tagging show that the
R2T-BiLSTM model, trained only on unlabeled text, achieves 98.2% accuracy,
outperforming baselines like AfriBERTa fine-tuned on 300 labeled sentences. We
further show that for more complex tasks like named entity recognition (NER),
R2T serves as a powerful pre-training step; a model pre-trained with R2T and
fine-tuned on just 50 labeled sentences outperformes a baseline trained on 300.

TL;DR: CoRE是一个即插即用的技术，利用模型一致性来提高大语言模型集成的鲁棒性，通过token级和模型级一致性处理集成中的错误信号。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 不同的大语言模型具有不同的优势和劣势，集成方法可以整合它们的互补能力。然而，现有研究很少关注集成对潜在错误信号的鲁棒性，这些错误信号通常源于异构的分词方案和不同的模型专业知识。

Method: 提出CoRE技术，包含两个层面的处理：token级一致性通过低通滤波器降低高不一致性token的权重，处理分词不对齐问题；模型级一致性通过提升高自信度且与其他模型差异小的模型输出来增强全局一致性。

Result: 在多个基准测试、模型组合和集成策略上的广泛实验表明，CoRE能够持续提升集成性能和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: CoRE作为一种即插即用的技术，能够有效提高LLM集成的鲁棒性，处理由分词差异和模型专业知识不同导致的集成失败问题。

Abstract: Different large language models (LLMs) exhibit diverse strengths and
weaknesses, and LLM ensemble serves as a promising approach to integrate their
complementary capabilities. Despite substantial progress in improving ensemble
quality, limited attention has been paid to the robustness of ensembles against
potential erroneous signals, which often arise from heterogeneous tokenization
schemes and varying model expertise. Our analysis shows that ensemble failures
typically arise from both the token level and the model level: the former
reflects severe disagreement in token predictions, while the latter involves
low confidence and pronounced disparities among models. In light of this, we
propose CoRE, a plug-and-play technique that harnesses model consistency for
robust LLM ensemble, which can be seamlessly integrated with diverse ensemble
methods. Token-level consistency captures fine-grained disagreements by
applying a low-pass filter to downweight uncertain tokens with high
inconsistency, often due to token misalignment, thereby improving robustness at
a granular level. Model-level consistency models global agreement by promoting
model outputs with high self-confidence and minimal divergence from others,
enhancing robustness at a coarser level. Extensive experiments across diverse
benchmarks, model combinations, and ensemble strategies demonstrate that CoRE
consistently improves ensemble performance and robustness.

TL;DR: 提出一种无需训练、无需标签的意图聚类方法，使用轻量级开源LLM生成伪标签，通过多标签分类实现聚类，无需预先知道聚类数量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法依赖商业LLM成本高、透明度低，且需要预先知道聚类数量的问题。

Method: 首先让LLM为每个文本生成伪标签，然后在伪标签集上对每个文本进行多标签分类，基于相同聚类的文本共享更多标签的假设。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上评估，结果优于或与现有基线方法相当，同时保持简单和计算高效。

Conclusion: 该方法适用于低资源场景，在多个模型和数据集上表现稳定，伪标签比直接相似度匹配更具可读性。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose an intuitive, training-free and label-free method
for intent clustering that makes minimal assumptions using lightweight and
open-source LLMs. Many current approaches rely on commercial LLMs, which are
costly, and offer limited transparency. Additionally, their methods often
explicitly depend on knowing the number of clusters in advance, which is often
not the case in realistic settings. To address these challenges, instead of
asking the LLM to match similar text directly, we first ask it to generate
pseudo-labels for each text, and then perform multi-label classification in
this pseudo-label set for each text. This approach is based on the hypothesis
that texts belonging to the same cluster will share more labels, and will
therefore be closer when encoded into embeddings. These pseudo-labels are more
human-readable than direct similarity matches. Our evaluation on four benchmark
sets shows that our approach achieves results comparable to and better than
recent baselines, while remaining simple and computationally efficient. Our
findings indicate that our method can be applied in low-resource scenarios and
is stable across multiple models and datasets.

MEDIQA-WV 2025 shared task addressed wound-care VQA, requiring systems to
generate free-text responses and structured wound attributes from images and
patient queries. We present the MasonNLP system, which employs a
general-domain, instruction-tuned large language model with a

visual examples from in-domain data. This approach grounds outputs in
clinically relevant exemplars, improving reasoning, schema adherence, and
response quality across dBLEU, ROUGE, BERTScore, and LLM-based metrics. Our
best-performing system ranked 3rd among 19 teams and 51 submissions with an
average score of 41.37%, demonstrating that lightweight RAG with
general-purpose LLMs -- a minimal inference-time layer that adds a few relevant
exemplars via simple indexing and fusion, with no extra training or complex
re-ranking -- provides a simple and effective baseline for multimodal clinical
NLP tasks.

Conclusion: nugget-as-rubric范式为搜索增强LLMs提供了一种统一且可验证的评估方法，Search-Gen-V验证器在准确性和效率方面表现出色，解决了现有奖励建模的局限性。

Abstract: Search augmentation empowers Large Language Models with retrieval
capabilities to overcome the limitations imposed by static parameters.
Recently, Reinforcement Learning leverages tailored reward signals as a viable
technique to enhance LLMs performing tasks involving search. However, existing
reward modeling for search-augmented LLMs faces several limitations. Rule-based
rewards, such as Exact Match, are verifiable but fragile to variations in
expression and cannot be applied to long-form workloads. In contrast,
generative rewards improve robustness, but designing verifiable and stable
rewards for long-form workloads in dynamic corpora remains challenging and also
incurs high computational costs. In this paper, we propose a unified and
verifiable paradigm, "nugget-as-rubric", which treats atomic information points
as structured evaluation criteria for different search-augmentation workloads.
Short-form tasks correspond to a single rubric, whereas long-form tasks expand
to multiple rubrics aligned with the question's information needs. To support
long-form settings, we design an automatic rubric construction pipeline based
on query rewriting, which can automatically retrieve passages relevant to each
question and extract rubrics from them, both from static corpora and from
dynamic online web content. Furthermore, we introduce \textbf{Search-Gen-V}, a
4B-parameter efficient generative verifier under our proposed verifiable
paradigm, which is trained via the idea of distillation and a two-stage
strategy. Experimental results show that Search-Gen-V achieves strong
verification accuracy across different workloads, making it a scalable, robust,
and efficient verifiable reward constructor for search-augmented LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有transformer模型存在显著的内存和计算开销，研究表明这些模型存在架构冗余，为优化提供了机会。随着小型语言模型在智能体AI系统中的重要性增加，需要更高效的架构。

Method: 基于AI可解释性和推理时层剪枝的研究，将归一化和注意力计算近似为线性关系，用多层感知机(MLP)替代整个变换器块，减少KV缓存需求。

Result: 在中等上下文场景下，ShishuLM比父模型减少25%内存需求，训练和推理延迟提升40%。在两个不同规模的小型语言模型上验证了有效性。

Conclusion: 研究结果为从预训练角度构建更高效的小型语言模型架构提供了见解，证明了通过架构优化可以在不牺牲性能的情况下显著提升效率。

Abstract: While the transformer architecture has achieved state-of-the-art performance
on natural language processing tasks, these models impose substantial memory
and computational overhead. Recent research has identified significant
architectural redundancies within these models, presenting opportunities for
optimization without compromising performance. Taking insights from research in
AI interpretability and inference-time layer pruning, we introduce an efficient
language model architecture, referred to as ShishuLM, which reduces both the
parameter count and Key-Value (KV) cache requirements. Given the increasing
importance of Small Language Models (SLMs) in agentic AI systems, we evaluate
our approach on two SLMs of different scales. Our analysis reveals that for
moderate-context scenarios, normalization coupled with attention computation is
roughly linear with the input, enabling entire transformer blocks to be
approximated through Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs). Our results show that
ShishuLM provides up to 25% reduction in memory requirements and up to 40%
improvement in latency during both training and inference, compared to parent
models. Our experimental and analytical findings provide insights towards
building more efficient SLM architectures from a pre-training standpoint.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管已有研究探讨LLM在教育中的学习影响，但LLM介导辅导中的情感动态仍未被充分理解，需要关注学习者在AI辅导中的情感状态变化。

Method: 分析两个学期16,986个对话轮次，使用三种前沿LLM（Gemini、GPT-4o、Claude）进行零样本情感标注，通过排名加权模型内池化和多数共识融合生成稳健的情感档案。

Result: 学生与AI导师互动时通常报告轻度积极情感和中等唤醒度；困惑和好奇是问题解决的常见伴随情感；负面情感通常快速消退，中性时刻常作为转折点。

Conclusion: 情感状态短暂易变，中性时刻提供了辅导干预的关键机会点，为负责任地将生成式AI整合到教育中提供了重要见解。

Abstract: While recent studies have examined the leaning impact of large language model
(LLM) in educational contexts, the affective dynamics of LLM-mediated tutoring
remain insufficiently understood. This work introduces the first ensemble-LLM
framework for large-scale affect sensing in tutoring dialogues, advancing the
conversation on responsible pathways for integrating generative AI into
education by attending to learners' evolving affective states. To achieve this,
we analyzed two semesters' worth of 16,986 conversational turns exchanged
between PyTutor, an LLM-powered AI tutor, and 261 undergraduate learners across
three U.S. institutions. To investigate learners' emotional experiences, we
generate zero-shot affect annotations from three frontier LLMs (Gemini, GPT-4o,
Claude), including scalar ratings of valence, arousal, and
learning-helpfulness, along with free-text emotion labels. These estimates are
fused through rank-weighted intra-model pooling and plurality consensus across
models to produce robust emotion profiles. Our analysis shows that during
interaction with the AI tutor, students typically report mildly positive affect
and moderate arousal. Yet learning is not uniformly smooth: confusion and
curiosity are frequent companions to problem solving, and frustration, while
less common, still surfaces in ways that can derail progress. Emotional states
are short-lived--positive moments last slightly longer than neutral or negative
ones, but they are fragile and easily disrupted. Encouragingly, negative
emotions often resolve quickly, sometimes rebounding directly into positive
states. Neutral moments frequently act as turning points, more often steering
students upward than downward, suggesting opportunities for tutors to intervene
at precisely these junctures.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文比较了对比学习(CL)和监督微调(SFT)在LLM重排序任务中的效果，发现SFT在权重更新方面显著优于CL，从而在LLM重排序中表现更好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在信息检索中，BERT编码器使用对比学习更有效，而LLM使用监督微调更有效，这种差异引发了关于哪种目标函数更适合LLM重排序的研究动机。

Method: 将目标函数分解为权重和方向两个组件，在通用多模态检索(UMR)平台上进行对比实验，通过探测实验分析CL和SFT的差异。

Result: SFT提供了比CL更强的权重更新方案，而评分方向没有明显差异。大规模训练验证了SFT在MRB基准测试中达到了新的最先进水平。

Conclusion: SFT在LLM重排序中具有一致优势，主要归因于其更强的权重更新机制，这为未来研究和应用提供了重要指导。

Abstract: In information retrieval, training reranking models mainly focuses on two
types of objectives: metric learning (e.g. contrastive loss to increase the
predicted scores on relevant query-document pairs) and classification (binary
label prediction of relevance vs. irrelevance). For BERT-style encoders,
various studies have shown that contrastive learning (CL) can be more effective
than discriminative (classification) learning. However, for large language
models (LLMs), classification via supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which predicts
''yes'' (resp. ''no'') token for relevant (resp. irrelevant) pairs, appears
more promising as it aligns well with the generative nature of LLMs. This
divergence raises a central question: which objective is intrinsically better
suited to LLM-based reranking, and what mechanism underlies the difference? In
this work, we conduct a comprehensive comparison and analysis between CL and
SFT for reranking, taking the universal multimodal retrieval (UMR) as the
experimental playground. We first decompose the objectives into two components:
weight, which controls the magnitude of those updates, and direction, which
guides the model updates, then present a unified framework for understanding
their interactions. Through probing experiments, we find that SFT provides a
substantially stronger weighting scheme than CL, whereas the preferred scoring
direction shows no clear winner. Taken together, these results point to a
consistent advantage of SFT over CL for LLM reranking. To further validate our
findings, we conduct large-scale training with SFT and present new
state-of-the-art rerankers on the MRB benchmark. We also provide ablations on
SFT settings and expect our findings to benefit future research and
applications in this area.

Method: 模板填充(TI)首先生成目标响应的结构模板，然后填充掩码段；动态段分配(DSA)根据生成置信度自适应调整段长度。

Result: 在数学推理和代码生成基准测试中，相比基线方法实现了17.01%的持续改进，并在多令牌生成设置中保持质量的同时实现有效加速。

Conclusion: TI方法为扩散语言模型提供了有效的结构化生成控制，显著提升了性能并支持高效的多令牌生成。

Abstract: Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) have emerged as a promising alternative to
Autoregressive Language Models, yet their inference strategies remain limited
to prefix-based prompting inherited from the autoregressive paradigm. In this
paper, we propose Template Infilling (TI), a tailored conditioning methodology
for DLMs' generation process. Unlike conventional prefix prompting, TI first
generates a structural template for the target response, then fills in the
masked segments. To enhance the flexibility of this structural control, we
introduce Dynamic Segment Allocation (DSA), which adaptively adjusts segment
lengths based on generation confidence. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach on mathematical reasoning and code generation benchmarks, achieving
consistent improvements of 17.01$\%$p over baseline. Furthermore, we show that
TI provides additional advantages in multi-token generation settings, enabling
effective speedup while maintaining generation quality.

Abstract: Under-resourced languages, such as Quechuas, face data and resource scarcity,
hindering their development in speech technology. To address this issue, Common
Voice presents a crucial opportunity to foster an open and community-driven
speech dataset creation. This paper examines the integration of Quechua

Abstract: Developing natural language processing tools for clinical text requires
annotated datasets, yet French oncology resources remain scarce. We present
FRACCO (FRench Annotated Corpus for Clinical Oncology) an expert-annotated
corpus of 1301 synthetic French clinical cases, initially translated from the
Spanish CANTEMIST corpus as part of the FRASIMED initiative. Each document is
annotated with terms related to morphology, topography, and histologic
differentiation, using the International Classification of Diseases for
Oncology (ICD-O) as reference. An additional annotation layer captures
composite expression-level normalisations that combine multiple ICD-O elements
into unified clinical concepts. Annotation quality was ensured through expert
review: 1301 texts were manually annotated for entity spans by two domain
experts. A total of 71127 ICD-O normalisations were produced through a
combination of automated matching and manual validation by a team of five
annotators. The final dataset representing 399 unique morphology codes (from
2549 different expressions), 272 topography codes (from 3143 different

*Filipe Laitenberger,Dawid Kopiczko,Cees G. M. Snoek,Yuki M. Asano*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GateSkip是一种简单的残差流门控机制，通过在解码器模型中添加sigmoid线性门来实现token级别的层跳过，在推理时根据门值对token进行排序并按预算跳过低重要性token，实现计算节省。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的早期退出或基于路由器的混合深度模型存在不稳定且需要大量重新训练的问题，需要一种能够在预训练模型上稳定微调的层跳过方法。

Method: 为每个Attention/MLP分支配备sigmoid线性门，在推理时根据门值对token排序并按层预算跳过低重要性token，该方法可在预训练模型上稳定微调。

Result: 在长文本推理任务上节省15%计算同时保持90%以上基线准确率；在指令调优模型上，全计算时获得准确率提升，50%节省时匹配基线质量。

Conclusion: GateSkip提供了一种稳定有效的层跳过方法，不仅节省计算，还揭示了transformer信息流特性，并能与量化、剪枝和自推测解码等技术轻松结合。

Abstract: We introduce GateSkip, a simple residual-stream gating mechanism that enables
token-wise layer skipping in decoder-only LMs. Each Attention/MLP branch is
equipped with a sigmoid-linear gate that condenses the branch's output before
it re-enters the residual stream. During inference we rank tokens by the gate
values and skip low-importance ones using a per-layer budget. While early-exit
or router-based Mixture-of-Depths models are known to be unstable and need
extensive retraining, our smooth, differentiable gates fine-tune stably on top
of pretrained models. On long-form reasoning, we save up to 15\% compute while
retaining over 90\% of baseline accuracy. On instruction-tuned models we see
accuracy gains at full compute and match baseline quality near 50\% savings.
The learned gates give insight into transformer information flow (e.g., BOS
tokens act as anchors), and the method combines easily with quantization,
pruning, and self-speculative decoding.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个纯文本反馈的多臂老虎机基准测试，评估LLM在不确定性下的顺序决策能力，发现Qwen3-4B模型在最佳臂选择率上达到89.2%，超越了传统算法和其他LLM。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLM仅使用自然语言在不确定性环境下进行顺序决策的能力，目前这方面的研究仍不充分。

Method: 创建纯文本反馈的多臂老虎机环境，LLM通过"你获得了一个代币"这样的文本反馈来推断潜在奖励结构，并与Thompson Sampling、Epsilon Greedy、UCB等传统算法进行比较。

Result: 大多数LLM表现不如基线算法，但Qwen3-4B达到了89.2%的最佳臂选择率，显著优于更大的LLM和传统方法。

Conclusion: 概率推理能力可以从纯语言中涌现，该基准测试为评估自然主义、非数值环境下的决策能力迈出了一步。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown to be increasingly capable of
performing reasoning tasks, but their ability to make sequential decisions
under uncertainty only using natural language remains underexplored. We
introduce a novel benchmark in which LLMs interact with multi-armed bandit
environments using purely textual feedback, "you earned a token", without
access to numerical cues or explicit probabilities, resulting in the model to
infer latent reward structures purely off linguistic cues and to adapt
accordingly. We evaluated the performance of four open-source LLMs and compare
their performance to standard decision-making algorithms such as Thompson
Sampling, Epsilon Greedy, Upper Confidence Bound (UCB), and random choice.
While most of the LLMs underperformed compared to the baselines, Qwen3-4B,
achieved the best-arm selection rate of 89.2% , which significantly
outperformed both the larger LLMs and traditional methods. Our findings suggest
that probabilistic reasoning is able to emerge from language alone, and we
present this benchmark as a step towards evaluating decision-making
capabilities in naturalistic, non-numeric contexts.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Catch Your Breath的训练方法，让语言模型能够动态地为每个输入token自主决定所需的计算步数，通过输出<don't know>来请求额外计算时间，从而提高模型效率和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统语言模型对所有token使用相同的计算量，但不同token的复杂度差异很大。为了让模型能够根据token复杂度动态调整计算资源，提高计算效率同时保持准确性。

Method: 提出了三种CYB损失函数：CYB-AP（随时预测）、CYB-VA（变分方法）和CYB-DP（计算预算惩罚）。模型通过输出<don't know>请求暂停，获得额外计算时间来处理复杂token。

Result: CYB模型仅需基线模型1/3的训练数据就能达到相同性能，比带暂停的交叉熵损失模型少用一半数据。模型能够智能地根据token复杂度请求暂停，如在复数名词后暂停，但在缩略词前不暂停。

Conclusion: CYB方法有效实现了语言模型计算资源的动态分配，显著提高了训练效率和模型性能，使模型能够根据token复杂度自适应调整计算时间。

Abstract: We explore a class of supervised training objectives that allow a language
model to dynamically and autonomously scale the number of compute steps used
for each input token. For any token, the model can request additional compute
steps by emitting a <don't know> output. If the model is granted a delay, a
specialized <pause> token is inserted at the next input step, providing the
model with additional compute resources to generate an output. The model can
request multiple pauses. To train the model to use <don't know> outputs
judiciously and to calibrate its uncertainty, we frame the selection of each
output token as a sequential-decision problem with a time cost. We refer to the
class of methods as $\textit{Catch Your Breath}$ losses and we study three
methods in this class: CYB-AP frames the model's task as anytime prediction,
where an output may be required at any step and accuracy is discounted over
time; CYB-VA is a variational approach that aims to maximize prediction
accuracy subject to a specified distribution over stopping times; and CYB-DP
imposes a penalty based on a computational budget. Through fine-tuning
experiments, we identify the best performing loss variant. The CYB model needs
only one third as much training data as the baseline (no pause) model needs to
achieve the same performance, and half as much data as a model with pauses and
a cross-entropy loss. We find that the CYB model requests additional steps when
doing so improves accuracy, and the model adapts its processing time to
token-level complexity and context. For example, it often pauses after plural
nouns like $\textit{patients}$ and $\textit{challenges}$ but never pauses after
the first token of contracted words like $\textit{wasn}$ and $\textit{didn}$,
and it shows high variability for ambiguous tokens like $\textit{won}$, which
could function as either a verb or part of a contraction.

Method: 使用分类器或提取器等轻量级辅助模块从输入文本中提取推理信息，构建增强输入来改进生成质量

Result: 在需求工程领域的概念验证中，使用分类器辅助模块成功提升了软件需求生成的质量

Conclusion: PAGE提供了一个简单、模块化的架构，易于适应不同任务，无需复杂的辅助生成模型

Abstract: In recent years, natural language generative models have shown outstanding
performance in text generation tasks. However, when facing specific tasks or
particular requirements, they may exhibit poor performance or require
adjustments that demand large amounts of additional data. This work introduces
PAGE (Prompt Augmentation for text Generation Enhancement), a framework
designed to assist these models through the use of simple auxiliary modules.
These modules, lightweight models such as classifiers or extractors, provide
inferences from the input text. The output of these auxiliaries is then used to
construct an enriched input that improves the quality and controllability of
the generation. Unlike other generation-assistance approaches, PAGE does not
require auxiliary generative models; instead, it proposes a simpler, modular
architecture that is easy to adapt to different tasks. This paper presents the
proposal, its components and architecture, and reports a proof of concept in
the domain of requirements engineering, where an auxiliary module with a
classifier is used to improve the quality of software requirements generation.

TL;DR: 本文主张在LLM社会模拟中采用开放式文本生成方法，而非局限于多项选择或简答格式，以更真实地模拟社会现象和公众意见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大多数LLM社会模拟研究采用封闭式设计，忽略了LLM的生成特性，无法真实反映社会现象的复杂性和多样性。

Method: 基于调查方法学研究和NLP最新进展，提出在LLM社会模拟中采用自由文本生成方法，捕捉主题、观点和推理过程。

Result: 开放式方法能改进测量和设计，探索意外观点，减少研究者偏见，捕捉表达性和个体性，辅助预测试，提升方法效用。

Conclusion: 呼吁开发新的实践和评估框架，充分利用LLM的开放式生成多样性，促进NLP与社会科学的协同发展。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used to simulate public opinion
and other social phenomena. Most current studies constrain these simulations to
multiple-choice or short-answer formats for ease of scoring and comparison, but
such closed designs overlook the inherently generative nature of LLMs. In this
position paper, we argue that open-endedness, using free-form text that
captures topics, viewpoints, and reasoning processes "in" LLMs, is essential
for realistic social simulation. Drawing on decades of survey-methodology
research and recent advances in NLP, we argue why this open-endedness is
valuable in LLM social simulations, showing how it can improve measurement and
design, support exploration of unanticipated views, and reduce
researcher-imposed directive bias. It also captures expressiveness and
individuality, aids in pretesting, and ultimately enhances methodological
utility. We call for novel practices and evaluation frameworks that leverage
rather than constrain the open-ended generative diversity of LLMs, creating
synergies between NLP and social science.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估当代大语言模型在非结构化文本分类任务中的实际性能，了解其在压缩丰富文本到有限分类体系时的能力限制。

Method: 使用统一的8,660个人工标注样本和相同的零样本提示，对10个LLMs进行评估，采用经典指标和LLM特定指标，并开发了基于集成的多模型协作方法。

Result: 当代LLMs平均准确率34%，精确率42%，召回率45%，F1分数41%；Gemini 1.5/2.0 Flash和GPT 20B/120B在成本效益方面表现最佳；集成方法显著提升准确率并完全消除幻觉。

Conclusion: 单纯的模型规模和架构改进不能确保更好的分类准确性，而模型间的协调编排可能是实现超越人类专家性能的最有效途径。

Abstract: This study presents a comparative evaluation of ten state-of-the-art large
language models (LLMs) applied to unstructured text categorization using the
Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB) 2.2 hierarchical taxonomy. The analysis
employed a uniform dataset of 8,660 human-annotated samples and identical
zero-shot prompts to ensure methodological consistency across all models.
Evaluation metrics included four classic measures - accuracy, precision,
recall, and F1-score - and three LLM-specific indicators: hallucination ratio,
inflation ratio, and categorization cost.
  Results show that, despite their rapid advancement, contemporary LLMs achieve
only moderate classic performance, with average scores of 34% accuracy, 42%
precision, 45% recall, and 41% F1-score. Hallucination and inflation ratios
reveal that models frequently overproduce categories relative to human
annotators. Among the evaluated systems, Gemini 1.5/2.0 Flash and GPT 20B/120B
offered the most favorable cost-to-performance balance, while GPT 120B
demonstrated the lowest hallucination ratio. The findings suggest that scaling
and architectural improvements alone do not ensure better categorization
accuracy, as the task requires compressing rich unstructured text into a
limited taxonomy - a process that challenges current model architectures.
  To address these limitations, a separate ensemble-based approach was
developed and tested. The ensemble method, in which multiple LLMs act as
independent experts, substantially improved accuracy, reduced inflation, and
completely eliminated hallucinations. These results indicate that coordinated
orchestration of models - rather than sheer scale - may represent the most
effective path toward achieving or surpassing human-expert performance in
large-scale text categorization.

Motivation: 当前LLM在数学推理方面主要关注可验证的最终答案，但自然语言数学证明的生成和验证仍是一个开放挑战，缺乏可靠的细粒度评估器。

Method: 引入ProofBench专家标注数据集，系统探索评估器设计空间，开发ProofGrader评估器，结合强推理骨干模型、参考解决方案和评分方案的丰富上下文，以及简单的集成方法。

Result: ProofGrader在专家评分上实现了0.926的低平均绝对误差，显著优于朴素基线。在最佳选择任务中，ProofGrader平均得分4.14（满分7），填补了朴素二元评估器（2.48）与人类专家（4.62）之间78%的差距。

Conclusion: ProofGrader评估器在数学证明评估方面表现出色，具有推动下游证明生成的潜力。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) for mathematical reasoning
have largely focused on tasks with easily verifiable final answers; however,
generating and verifying natural language math proofs remains an open
challenge. We identify the absence of a reliable, fine-grained evaluator for
LLM-generated math proofs as a critical gap. To address this, we propose a
systematic methodology for developing and validating evaluators that assign
fine-grained scores on a 0-7 scale to model-generated math proofs. To enable
this study, we introduce ProofBench, the first expert-annotated dataset of
fine-grained proof ratings, spanning 145 problems from six major math
competitions (USAMO, IMO, Putnam, etc) and 435 LLM-generated solutions from
Gemini-2.5-pro, o3, and DeepSeek-R1. %with expert gradings. Using ProofBench as
a testbed, we systematically explore the evaluator design space across key
axes: the backbone model, input context, instructions and evaluation workflow.
Our analysis delivers ProofGrader, an evaluator that combines a strong
reasoning backbone LM, rich context from reference solutions and marking
schemes, and a simple ensembling method; it achieves a low Mean Absolute Error
(MAE) of 0.926 against expert scores, significantly outperforming naive
baselines. Finally, we demonstrate its practical utility in a best-of-$n$
selection task: at $n=16$, ProofGrader achieves an average score of 4.14 (out
of 7), closing 78% of the gap between a naive binary evaluator (2.48) and the
human oracle (4.62), highlighting its potential to advance downstream proof
generation.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have advanced many domains and applications but
face high fine-tuning costs, inference latency, limited edge deployability, and
reliability concerns. Small language models (SLMs), compact, efficient, and

generalization and reasoning to meet diverse objectives across tasks and
deployment scenarios. Motivated by these developments, this paper presents a
systematic survey of SLM-LLM collaboration organized by collaboration
objectives. We propose a taxonomy with four goals: performance enhancement,
cost-effectiveness, cloud-edge privacy, and trustworthiness. Within this
framework, we review representative methods, summarize design paradigms, and
outline open challenges and future directions toward efficient, secure, and
scalable SLM-LLM collaboration.

Motivation: 现有方法在高质量监督微调数据选择过程中过度依赖LLM内部知识、可解释性差且泛化能力有限，需要更有效的数据选择框架。

Method: THTB框架结合质量过滤与内在和外在难度评分，优先选择更高级认知指令，为SFT提供可解释和可量化的数据选择标准。

Result: 实验显示THTB仅用5%数据训练的模型就超越全数据集训练，在垂直领域仅用2%数据就能超越更大数据集训练的模型。

Conclusion: THTB在数据选择和标注指导方面具有显著优势，为领域适应提供了强大潜力，代码和模型已开源。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in general tasks, but adapting them to
specialized domains relies on high-quality supervised fine-tuning (SFT) data.
Although existing methods can identify subsets of high-quality data and reduce
training cost to some extent, their selection process still suffers from
over-reliance on LLMs' internal knowledge, weak interpretability, and limited
generalization. To address these limitations, we propose THTB (The Harder The
Better), a cognitive science-inspired framework for instruction data selection
and annotation guidance. THTB prioritizes higher-level cognitive instructions
by combining quality filtering with intrinsic and extrinsic hardness scoring,
offering interpretable and quantifiable criteria for efficient SFT, both in
data selection and annotation guidance. Experiments show that THTB enables
models trained on only 5% of the data to outperform full-dataset training,
while achieving superior generalization compared with LLM-only selection. In
addition, THTB provides effective annotation guidance in vertical domains,
enabling a model trained on just 2% of the data to surpass models trained on
much larger datasets, demonstrating strong potential for domain adaptation. Our
code, datasets, and models are available on

Motivation: 现有防御方法主要针对单轮攻击，缺乏跨语言覆盖，且分类法有限，无法全面捕捉攻击策略的多样性或过于强调风险类别而非越狱技术本身。

Method: 采用结构化红队挑战方法，开发了包含7大类50种策略的层次化越狱分类法，收集挑战数据进行分析，并评估基于分类法的提示方法对自动检测的改进效果。

Result: 创建了全面的越狱策略分类法，分析了不同攻击类型的流行度和成功率，发现分类法引导的提示能改进自动检测，并构建了包含1364个多轮对抗对话的意大利语数据集。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了对越狱技术有效性的深入理解，开发了全面的分类框架，并为研究多轮对抗对话中逐渐出现的对抗意图提供了新的数据集和工具。

Abstract: Jailbreaking techniques pose a significant threat to the safety of Large
Language Models (LLMs). Existing defenses typically focus on single-turn
attacks, lack coverage across languages, and rely on limited taxonomies that
either fail to capture the full diversity of attack strategies or emphasize
risk categories rather than the jailbreaking techniques. To advance the
understanding of the effectiveness of jailbreaking techniques, we conducted a
structured red-teaming challenge. The outcome of our experiments are manifold.
First, we developed a comprehensive hierarchical taxonomy of 50 jailbreak
strategies, consolidating and extending prior classifications into seven broad
families, including impersonation, persuasion, privilege escalation, cognitive
overload, obfuscation, goal conflict, and data poisoning. Second, we analyzed
the data collected from the challenge to examine the prevalence and success
rates of different attack types, providing insights into how specific jailbreak
strategies exploit model vulnerabilities and induce misalignment. Third, we
benchmark a popular LLM for jailbreak detection, evaluating the benefits of
taxonomy-guided prompting for improving automatic detection. Finally, we
compiled a new Italian dataset of 1364 multi-turn adversarial dialogues,
annotated with our taxonomy, enabling the study of interactions where
adversarial intent emerges gradually and succeeds in bypassing traditional
safeguards.

continuation from either GPT-4o or LLaMA-70B-Instruct. The Style Embedding
baseline achieves stronger aggregate accuracy on GPT continuations (82 pct vs.
68 pct). The LLM Judge is slightly better than the Style embeddings on LLaMA
continuations (85 pct vs. 81 pct) but the results are not statistically
significant. Crucially, the LLM judge significantly outperforms in fiction and
academic prose, indicating semantic sensitivity, whereas embeddings dominate in
spoken and scripted dialogue, reflecting structural strengths. These
complementary patterns highlight attribution as a multidimensional problem
requiring hybrid strategies. To support reproducibility we provide code on

Motivation: 研究窄域微调对LLM激活的影响，揭示微调过程中产生的偏见，并探索这些偏见在理解微调领域和AI安全研究中的意义。

Method: 使用模型差异分析工具，分析随机文本前几个token的激活差异，并将这些差异添加到模型激活中进行引导生成。创建基于LLM的可解释性代理来理解微调领域。

Result: 发现窄域微调模型在激活中存在明显的训练目标痕迹，这些偏见可用于生成类似微调数据的内容。在多种架构和规模的模型上验证了这一现象。

Conclusion: 窄域微调模型在激活中保留训练目标的显著痕迹，这对AI安全和可解释性研究具有重要启示，需要开发更真实的案例研究。

Abstract: Finetuning on narrow domains has become an essential tool to adapt Large
Language Models (LLMs) to specific tasks and to create models with known
unusual properties that are useful for research. We show that narrow finetuning
creates strong biases in LLM activations that can be interpreted to understand
the finetuning domain. These biases can be discovered using simple tools from
model diffing - the study of differences between models before and after
finetuning. In particular, analyzing activation differences on the first few
tokens of random text and steering by adding this difference to the model
activations produces text similar to the format and general content of the
finetuning data. We demonstrate that these analyses contain crucial information
by creating an LLM-based interpretability agent to understand the finetuning
domain. With access to the bias, the agent performs significantly better
compared to baseline agents using simple prompting. Our analysis spans
synthetic document finetuning for false facts, emergent misalignment,
subliminal learning, and taboo word guessing game models across different
architectures (Gemma, LLaMA, Qwen) and scales (1B to 32B parameters). We
suspect these biases reflect overfitting and find that mixing pretraining data
into the finetuning corpus largely removes them, though residual risks may
remain. Our work (1) demonstrates that narrowly finetuned models have salient
traces of their training objective in their activations and suggests ways to
improve how they are trained, (2) warns AI safety and interpretability
researchers that the common practice of using such models as a proxy for
studying broader finetuning (e.g., chat-tuning) might not be realistic, and (3)
highlights the need for deeper investigation into the effects of narrow
finetuning and development of truly realistic case studies for model-diffing,
safety and interpretability research.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RAID是一个针对大语言模型越狱攻击的框架，通过优化对抗性后缀来绕过安全机制，在嵌入空间中使用拒绝感知正则化提高攻击成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在各种任务中表现出色，但仍然容易受到越狱攻击的威胁，这些攻击能够绕过模型的安全机制。

Method: RAID将离散标记松弛为连续嵌入，通过联合目标优化：(i)鼓励受限响应，(ii)使用拒绝感知正则化器引导激活远离嵌入空间中的拒绝方向，(iii)应用连贯性术语保持语义合理性和非冗余性。优化后，通过批评引导的解码程序将嵌入映射回标记。

Result: 在多个开源大语言模型上的实验表明，RAID比最近的白盒和黑盒基线方法实现了更高的攻击成功率，同时使用更少的查询和更低的计算成本。

Conclusion: 这些发现强调了嵌入空间正则化对于理解和减轻大语言模型越狱漏洞的重要性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve impressive performance across diverse
tasks yet remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks that bypass safety mechanisms.
We present RAID (Refusal-Aware and Integrated Decoding), a framework that
systematically probes these weaknesses by crafting adversarial suffixes that
induce restricted content while preserving fluency. RAID relaxes discrete
tokens into continuous embeddings and optimizes them with a joint objective
that (i) encourages restricted responses, (ii) incorporates a refusal-aware
regularizer to steer activations away from refusal directions in embedding
space, and (iii) applies a coherence term to maintain semantic plausibility and
non-redundancy. After optimization, a critic-guided decoding procedure maps
embeddings back to tokens by balancing embedding affinity with language-model
likelihood. This integration yields suffixes that are both effective in
bypassing defenses and natural in form. Experiments on multiple open-source
LLMs show that RAID achieves higher attack success rates with fewer queries and
lower computational cost than recent white-box and black-box baselines. These
findings highlight the importance of embedding-space regularization for
understanding and mitigating LLM jailbreak vulnerabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM在日常生活中的广泛应用，特别是在医疗、人际关系和法律等关键领域作为建议提供者，需要了解LLM在困难的政治和道德领域是否存在偏见。

Method: 使用道德基础理论框架，直接比较LLM响应与现有的人类研究数据，分析LLM在不同条件下的响应：固有响应、明确政治意识形态表示、以及从构建的人类角色视角响应。

Result: 系统分析了LLM在这些条件和实验中的行为，揭示了AI生成响应中的政治和人口统计依赖性程度。

Conclusion: 研究为理解LLM在道德和政治领域的偏见提供了重要见解，揭示了AI响应中的意识形态倾向问题。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become increasingly incorporated into
everyday life for many internet users, taking on significant roles as advice
givers in the domains of medicine, personal relationships, and even legal
matters. The importance of these roles raise questions about how and what
responses LLMs make in difficult political and moral domains, especially
questions about possible biases. To quantify the nature of potential biases in
LLMs, various works have applied Moral Foundations Theory (MFT), a framework
that categorizes human moral reasoning into five dimensions: Harm, Fairness,
Ingroup Loyalty, Authority, and Purity. Previous research has used the MFT to
measure differences in human participants along political, national, and
cultural lines. While there has been some analysis of the responses of LLM with
respect to political stance in role-playing scenarios, no work so far has
directly assessed the moral leanings in the LLM responses, nor have they
connected LLM outputs with robust human data. In this paper we analyze the
distinctions between LLM MFT responses and existing human research directly,
investigating whether commonly available LLM responses demonstrate ideological
leanings: either through their inherent responses, straightforward
representations of political ideologies, or when responding from the
perspectives of constructed human personas. We assess whether LLMs inherently
generate responses that align more closely with one political ideology over
another, and additionally examine how accurately LLMs can represent ideological
perspectives through both explicit prompting and demographic-based
role-playing. By systematically analyzing LLM behavior across these conditions
and experiments, our study provides insight into the extent of political and
demographic dependency in AI-generated responses.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统示例驱动的上下文学习缺乏知识检索和抽象层面传输的显式模块，受认知科学中模式理论启发，希望为语言模型提供类似人类认知的抽象框架。

Method: 从先验示例中提取推理过程的认知构建块表示，创建轻量级、结构化的抽象模式模板，包含关键推理步骤及其关系，用于增强模型面对新问题时的推理过程。

Result: 在GPQA数据集的化学和物理问题上，SA-ICL一致提升性能，当单个演示示例质量高时性能提升高达36.19%，同时减少对演示数量的依赖并增强可解释性。

Conclusion: SA-ICL不仅连接了从模式启动到思维链提示的不同ICL策略，还为增强语言模型中类人推理开辟了新路径。

Abstract: In-Context Learning (ICL) enables transformer-based language models to adapt
to new tasks by conditioning on demonstration examples. However, traditional
example-driven in-context learning lacks explicit modules for knowledge
retrieval and transfer at the abstraction level. Inspired by cognitive science,
specifically schema theory, which holds that humans interpret new information
by activating pre-existing mental frameworks (schemas) to structure
understanding, we introduce SCHEMA ACTIVATED IN CONTEXT LEARNING (SA-ICL). This
framework extracts the representation of the building blocks of cognition for
the reasoning process instilled from prior examples, creating an abstracted
schema, a lightweight, structured template of key inferential steps and their
relationships, which is then used to augment a model's reasoning process when
presented with a novel question. We demonstrate that a broad range of large
language models (LLMs) lack the capacity to form and utilize internal
schema-based learning representations implicitly, but instead benefit
significantly from explicit schema-based scaffolding. Across chemistry and
physics questions from the GPQA dataset, our experiments show that SA-ICL
consistently boosts performance, up to 36.19 percent, when the single
demonstration example is of high quality, which simultaneously reduces reliance
on the number of demonstrations and enhances interpretability. SCHEMA ACTIVATED
IN CONTEXT LEARNING not only bridges disparate ICL strategies ranging from
pattern priming to Chain-of-Thought prompting, but also paves a new path for
enhancing human-like reasoning in LLMs.

TL;DR: 提出了Prompt Duel Optimizer (PDO)，一个无需标签的提示优化框架，通过两两比较和双Thompson采样来高效优化LLM提示


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动提示优化方法需要真实标签数据，但高质量标签收集成本高且耗时，需要开发无需标签的优化方法

Method: 将提示优化建模为dueling-bandit问题，使用LLM作为评判者提供两两偏好反馈，结合双Thompson采样和基于优秀提示的变异策略

Result: 在BIG-bench Hard和MS MARCO上的实验表明PDO持续优于基线方法，消融研究验证了双Thompson采样和提示变异的有效性

Conclusion: PDO提供了一种样本高效的无需标签提示优化框架，能够有效利用LLM的偏好反馈来优化提示性能

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are highly sensitive to their input prompts,
making prompt design a central challenge. While automatic prompt optimization
(APO) reduces manual engineering, most approaches assume access to ground-truth
references such as labeled validation data. In practice, however, collecting
high-quality labels is costly and slow. We propose the Prompt Duel Optimizer
(PDO), a sample-efficient framework for label-free prompt optimization. PDO
formulates the problem as a dueling-bandit setting, where supervision signal
comes from pairwise preference feedback provided by an LLM judge. The framework
combines Double Thompson Sampling (D-TS), which prioritizes informative prompt
comparisons, with Top-Performer Guided Mutation, which expands the candidate
pool by mutating high-performing prompts. PDO naturally operates in label-free
settings and can also incorporate partial labels to mitigate judge noise.
Experiments on BIG-bench Hard (BBH) and MS MARCO show that PDO consistently
outperforms baseline methods. Ablation studies further demonstrate the
effectiveness of both D-TS and prompt mutation.

Motivation: 大型语言模型在算术任务上仍有困难，先前研究主要关注输出或提示策略，而本研究旨在探索模型进行算术计算的内部结构，特别是运算符优先级的编码方式。

Method: 构建包含三个操作数和两个运算符的算术表达式数据集，使用logit lens、线性分类探针和UMAP几何可视化等可解释性技术，并引入部分嵌入交换技术来修改运算符优先级。

Result: 研究发现中间计算存在于残差流中，特别是在MLP块之后，并且模型在注意力层后线性编码每个运算符嵌入中的优先级。

Conclusion: LLaMA 3.2-3B模型在其内部表示中编码了运算符优先级，这为理解语言模型如何执行算术计算提供了新的见解。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive reasoning
capabilities but continue to struggle with arithmetic tasks. Prior works
largely focus on outputs or prompting strategies, leaving the open question of
the internal structure through which models do arithmetic computation. In this
work, we investigate whether LLMs encode operator precedence in their internal
representations via the open-source instruction-tuned LLaMA 3.2-3B model. We
constructed a dataset of arithmetic expressions with three operands and two
operators, varying the order and placement of parentheses. Using this dataset,
we trace whether intermediate results appear in the residual stream of the
instruction-tuned LLaMA 3.2-3B model. We apply interpretability techniques such
as logit lens, linear classification probes, and UMAP geometric visualization.
Our results show that intermediate computations are present in the residual
stream, particularly after MLP blocks. We also find that the model linearly
encodes precedence in each operator's embeddings post attention layer. We
introduce partial embedding swap, a technique that modifies operator precedence
by exchanging high-impact embedding dimensions between operators.

Conclusion: KRLM模型通过统一协调LLM知识与KG上下文，有效解决了知识扭曲和生成幻觉问题，提升了知识图谱推理的可信度和性能。

Abstract: Inductive Knowledge Graph Reasoning (KGR) aims to discover facts in
open-domain KGs containing unknown entities and relations, which poses a
challenge for KGR models in comprehending uncertain KG components. Existing
studies have proposed Knowledge Graph Foundation Models (KGFMs) that learn
structural invariances across KGs to handle this uncertainty. Recently, Large
Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities for open-domain
knowledge reasoning. As a result, the latest research has focused on LLM-based
KGFMs that integrate LLM knowledge with KG context for inductive KGR. However,
the intrinsic knowledge of LLMs may be overshadowed by sparse KG context,
leading to LLM knowledge distortion, which can cause irreversible damage to
model reasoning. Moreover, existing LLM-based KGR methods still struggle to
fully constrain generative hallucinations in LLMs, severely limiting the
credibility of reasoning results. To address these limitations, we propose a
Knowledge Reasoning Language Model (KRLM) that achieves unified coordination
between LLM knowledge and KG context throughout the KGR process. Specifically,
we design a Knowledge Reasoning Language (KRL) instruction format and a KRL
tokenizer to align LLM knowledge with KG representations. Then, we propose a
KRL attention layer that coordinates intrinsic LLM knowledge with additional KG
context through a dynamic knowledge memory mechanism. Finally, a
structure-aware next-entity predictor is proposed, which strictly constrains
the reasoning results within a trustworthy knowledge domain. Extensive
experimental results on 25 real-world inductive KGR datasets demonstrate the
significant superiority of the proposed KRLM\footnote{Our source codes are
available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/KRLM-EA36 in both zero-shot
reasoning and fine-tuning scenarios.

Result: 实验表明，具备更强RAGCap性能的'慢思考'模型能获得更好的端到端结果。

Conclusion: 该基准验证了增强中间能力的重要性，为提升代理式RAG系统性能提供了有效评估工具。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mitigates key limitations of Large
Language Models (LLMs)-such as factual errors, outdated knowledge, and
hallucinations-by dynamically retrieving external information. Recent work
extends this paradigm through agentic RAG systems, where LLMs act as agents to
iteratively plan, retrieve, and reason over complex queries. However, these
systems still struggle with challenging multi-hop questions, and their
intermediate reasoning capabilities remain underexplored. To address this, we
propose RAGCap-Bench, a capability-oriented benchmark for fine-grained
evaluation of intermediate tasks in agentic RAG workflows. We analyze outputs
from state-of-the-art systems to identify common tasks and the core
capabilities required for their execution, then construct a taxonomy of typical
LLM errors to design targeted evaluation questions. Experiments show that
"slow-thinking" models with stronger RAGCap performance achieve better
end-to-end results, underscoring the benchmark's validity and the importance of
enhancing these intermediate capabilities.

Motivation: 现有AI辩论实验依赖有标准答案的数据集，忽略了主观维度中撒谎需要相信所辩护主张为假这一关键因素。研究旨在测试语言模型是否会采用谄媚策略来最大化说服力。

Method: 测量语言模型的先验信念，让辩手选择偏好立场后面对与自身信念冲突的法官角色，比较顺序和同步两种辩论协议，评估模型在辩护与先验信念一致/不一致立场时的说服力和论点质量。

Result: 模型倾向于辩护与法官角色一致的立场而非自身信念；顺序辩论对第二位辩手存在显著偏见；模型在辩护与先验信念一致立场时更具说服力；但与信念不一致的论点在成对比较中质量评分更高。

Conclusion: 这些发现有助于人类法官提供更高质量的训练信号，促进更对齐的AI系统，同时揭示了语言模型中说服动态的重要方面。

Abstract: The core premise of AI debate as a scalable oversight technique is that it is
harder to lie convincingly than to refute a lie, enabling the judge to identify
the correct position. Yet, existing debate experiments have relied on datasets
with ground truth, where lying is reduced to defending an incorrect
proposition. This overlooks a subjective dimension: lying also requires the
belief that the claim defended is false. In this work, we apply debate to
subjective questions and explicitly measure large language models' prior
beliefs before experiments. Debaters were asked to select their preferred
position, then presented with a judge persona deliberately designed to conflict
with their identified priors. This setup tested whether models would adopt
sycophantic strategies, aligning with the judge's presumed perspective to
maximize persuasiveness, or remain faithful to their prior beliefs. We
implemented and compared two debate protocols, sequential and simultaneous, to
evaluate potential systematic biases. Finally, we assessed whether models were
more persuasive and produced higher-quality arguments when defending positions
consistent with their prior beliefs versus when arguing against them. Our main
findings show that models tend to prefer defending stances aligned with the
judge persona rather than their prior beliefs, sequential debate introduces
significant bias favoring the second debater, models are more persuasive when
defending positions aligned with their prior beliefs, and paradoxically,
arguments misaligned with prior beliefs are rated as higher quality in pairwise
comparison. These results can inform human judges to provide higher-quality
training signals and contribute to more aligned AI systems, while revealing
important aspects of human-AI interaction regarding persuasion dynamics in
language models.

Conclusion: 提出的数据合成方法能够生成更高质量的训练数据，有效提升网络代理在复杂问答任务中的性能。

Abstract: Web-based 'deep research' agents aim to solve complex question - answering
tasks through long-horizon interactions with online tools. These tasks remain
challenging, as the underlying language models are often not optimized for
long-horizon reasoning and exploration. Prior work has proposed workflows for
constructing instruction-tuning datasets, often leveraging knowledge graphs.
However, such methods typically lack fine-grained control over difficulty and
quality, yielding synthetic data that falls short of capturing the complexity
required for long-horizon reasoning. Furthermore, many studies conflate data
and training effects by comparing models trained under different optimization
recipes, making it difficult to isolate and evaluate the effectiveness of the
data itself. We introduce a two-pronged data synthesis pipeline that generates
question - answer pairs by progressively increasing task complexity until a
frontier baseline web agent fails. The baseline agent plays multiple roles in
this process: attempting the questions, validating factuality, checking for
alternative answers, and enforcing filtering. To evaluate the effectiveness of
our synthesis methods, we adopt a controlled training setup based on
distillation from strong web agents. Experiments across multiple web-based
benchmarks show that our dataset - despite being smaller - enables the training
of more effective web agents than existing datasets. In particular, our data
exhibits twice the diversity in tool-use actions, allowing models trained on it
to achieve stronger performance while avoiding repetitive tool-calling
behaviors.

Motivation: 反驳当前认为可读性(如儿童导向语料)是小语言模型产生连贯文本关键因素的观点，质疑将语言模型训练与人类认知发展进行类比的趋势。

Method: 构建具有匹配结构但可读性不同的合成数据集，比较模型在简化语言和复杂成人级文本上的表现。

Result: 在复杂成人级文本上训练的模型与简化语言训练的模型表现相当，甚至训练过程中连贯性发展更快。统计简单性(n-gram多样性)是学习能力的更强预测因子。

Conclusion: 应避免将语言模型训练过度拟人化，需要更精确地理解支持小模型能力涌现的实际属性。

Abstract: Recent studies suggest that very small language models (SLMs) can generate
surprisingly coherent text when trained on simplified, child-directed corpora
such as TinyStories. These findings have been interpreted as evidence that
readability -- characterized by accessible vocabulary, familiar narrative
structure, and simple syntax -- plays a key role in enabling such capabilities
to emerge. In this paper, we challenge that interpretation. We construct
synthetic datasets with matched structure but varied readability, and find that
readability alone does not predict coherence or learning efficiency in SLMs.
Models trained on complex, adult-level text perform comparably to those trained
on simplified language, and even exhibit faster development of coherence during
training. Instead, we show that statistical simplicity, as measured by n-gram
diversity, is a stronger predictor of learnability. Our findings caution
against the growing trend of anthropomorphizing language model training --
drawing parallels to human cognitive development without empirical basis -- and
argue for more precise reasoning about what properties actually support
capability emergence in small models.

Result: 成功构建了化学元素的向量表示，能够有效处理文本分布差异和数据稀疏问题。

Conclusion: 这项工作为材料科学中AI驱动发现提供了新途径，有望推动该领域的发展。

Abstract: Accurate property data for chemical elements is crucial for materials design
and manufacturing, but many of them are difficult to measure directly due to
equipment constraints. While traditional methods use the properties of other
elements or related properties for prediction via numerical analyses, they
often fail to model complex relationships. After all, not all characteristics
can be represented as scalars. Recent efforts have been made to explore
advanced AI tools such as language models for property estimation, but they
still suffer from hallucinations and a lack of interpretability. In this paper,
we investigate Element2Vecto effectively represent chemical elements from
natural languages to support research in the natural sciences. Given the text
parsed from Wikipedia pages, we use language models to generate both a single
general-purpose embedding (Global) and a set of attribute-highlighted vectors
(Local). Despite the complicated relationship across elements, the
computational challenges also exist because of 1) the discrepancy in text
distribution between common descriptions and specialized scientific texts, and
2) the extremely limited data, i.e., with only 118 known elements, data for
specific properties is often highly sparse and incomplete. Thus, we also design
a test-time training method based on self-attention to mitigate the prediction
error caused by Vanilla regression clearly. We hope this work could pave the
way for advancing AI-driven discovery in materials science.

Method: 开发了理论框架来优化LLM和PRM信号的组合，提出加权聚合策略，并通过预计算方法校准权重函数。

Result: 在5个LLM和7个PRM上的广泛实验表明，校准方法显著提升了TTS效率，性能超越传统加权多数投票。

Conclusion: 投资更智能的聚合策略比单纯扩展测试时计算更能获得性能提升，为PRM的有效利用提供了新路径。

Abstract: Process reward models (PRMs) are a cornerstone of test-time scaling (TTS),
designed to verify and select the best responses from large language models
(LLMs). However, this promise is challenged by recent benchmarks where simple
majority voting, which ignores PRM signals, occasionally outperforms standard
PRM-based selection. This raises a critical question: How can we effectively
utilize verification signals from PRMs for TTS? To address this, we start by
developing a theoretical framework for optimally combining signals from both
the LLM and the PRM. Our framework reveals that the optimal strategy is a
weighted aggregation of responses, a strategy whose effectiveness hinges on
estimating weights that capture the complex interplay between the models. Based
on our theoretical results, we empirically show that these optimal weighting
functions differ significantly across LLM-PRM pairs and, notably, often assign
substantial negative weights. Motivated by these insights, we propose efficient
pre-computation methods to calibrate these weighting functions. Extensive
experiments across 5 LLMs and 7 PRMs demonstrate that our calibration method
significantly boosts the TTS efficiency, surpassing the performance of vanilla
weighted majority voting while using only $21.3\%$ of the computation.
Ultimately, our work demonstrates that investing in a more intelligent
aggregation strategy can be a more convincing path to performance gains than
simply scaling test-time computation.

*Ye Yuan,Mohammad Amin Shabani,Siqi Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: FACTS是一种快速、准确且隐私合规的表格摘要方法，通过离线模板生成实现查询聚焦的表格摘要。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有表格摘要方法存在成本高、推理能力弱、效率低、隐私泄露等问题，需要一种更实用的解决方案。

Method: 使用离线模板生成方法，创建包含SQL查询和Jinja2模板的可重用模板，仅向LLM发送表格模式以确保隐私。

Result: 在广泛使用的基准测试中，FACTS始终优于基线方法，证明了其在实际应用中的有效性。

Conclusion: FACTS为现实世界的查询聚焦表格摘要提供了一个实用的解决方案，具有快速、准确和隐私合规的优势。

Abstract: Query-focused table summarization requires generating natural language
summaries of tabular data conditioned on a user query, enabling users to access
insights beyond fact retrieval. Existing approaches face key limitations:
table-to-text models require costly fine-tuning and struggle with complex
reasoning, prompt-based LLM methods suffer from token-limit and efficiency
issues while exposing sensitive data, and prior agentic pipelines often rely on
decomposition, planning, or manual templates that lack robustness and
scalability. To mitigate these issues, we introduce an agentic workflow, FACTS,
a Fast, Accurate, and Privacy-Compliant Table Summarization approach via
Offline Template Generation. FACTS produces offline templates, consisting of
SQL queries and Jinja2 templates, which can be rendered into natural language
summaries and are reusable across multiple tables sharing the same schema. It
enables fast summarization through reusable offline templates, accurate outputs
with executable SQL queries, and privacy compliance by sending only table
schemas to LLMs. Evaluations on widely-used benchmarks show that FACTS
consistently outperforms baseline methods, establishing it as a practical
solution for real-world query-focused table summarization.

*Daniel Adu Worae,Spyridon Mastorakis*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出一个基于LLM的AI代理框架，将原始数据包捕获转换为结构化语义表示，用于物联网网络流量的交互式分析，通过混合检索方法显著提升评估指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 物联网网络产生多样且高流量的流量，需要跨层解释行为、协议和上下文，而不仅仅是孤立检测。

Method: 集成特征提取、基于Transformer的异常检测、数据包和流摘要、威胁情报增强以及检索增强问答的LLM驱动AI代理框架。

Result: 在多个物联网捕获和六个开放模型上的实验评估显示，混合检索（结合词汇和语义搜索与重排序）相比仅密集检索显著改善了BLEU、ROUGE、METEOR和BERTScore结果。系统分析显示CPU、GPU和内存开销低。

Conclusion: 该框架实现了物联网网络流量的全面高效解释，具有低资源开销。

Abstract: Internet of Things (IoT) networks generate diverse and high-volume traffic
that reflects both normal activity and potential threats. Deriving meaningful
insight from such telemetry requires cross-layer interpretation of behaviors,
protocols, and context rather than isolated detection. This work presents an
LLM-powered AI agent framework that converts raw packet captures into
structured and semantically enriched representations for interactive analysis.
The framework integrates feature extraction, transformer-based anomaly
detection, packet and flow summarization, threat intelligence enrichment, and
retrieval-augmented question answering. An AI agent guided by a large language
model performs reasoning over the indexed traffic artifacts, assembling
evidence to produce accurate and human-readable interpretations. Experimental
evaluation on multiple IoT captures and six open models shows that hybrid
retrieval, which combines lexical and semantic search with reranking,
substantially improves BLEU, ROUGE, METEOR, and BERTScore results compared with
dense-only retrieval. System profiling further indicates low CPU, GPU, and
memory overhead, demonstrating that the framework achieves holistic and
efficient interpretation of IoT network traffic.

*Congying Liu,Xingyuan Wei,Peipei Liu,Yiqing Shen,Yanxu Mao,Tiehan Cui*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: BioMedSearch是一个基于大语言模型的多源生物医学信息检索框架，通过整合文献检索、蛋白质数据库和网络搜索，解决了LLMs在生物医学领域缺乏科学严谨性的问题，显著提升了复杂生物医学问答的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生物医学查询需要深入理解专业知识并整合多源数据，但现有大语言模型由于无法访问权威生物医学数据库，经常生成缺乏科学严谨性甚至虚构的内容。

Method: 通过子查询分解、关键词提取、任务图构建和多源信息过滤，整合文献检索、蛋白质数据库和网络搜索，支持复杂生物医学查询的准确高效处理。

Result: 在构建的BioMedMCQs数据集（3000个问题）上，BioMedSearch在所有推理级别上都显著优于基线模型：Level 1准确率从59.1%提升至91.9%；Level 2从47.0%提升至81.0%；Level 3从36.3%提升至73.4%。

Conclusion: BioMedSearch框架通过多源信息检索有效解决了LLMs在生物医学领域的科学严谨性问题，显著提升了复杂生物医学问答的准确性。

Abstract: Biomedical queries often rely on a deep understanding of specialized
knowledge such as gene regulatory mechanisms and pathological processes of
diseases. They require detailed analysis of complex physiological processes and
effective integration of information from multiple data sources to support
accurate retrieval and reasoning. Although large language models (LLMs) perform
well in general reasoning tasks, their generated biomedical content often lacks
scientific rigor due to the inability to access authoritative biomedical
databases and frequently fabricates protein functions, interactions, and
structural details that deviate from authentic information. Therefore, we
present BioMedSearch, a multi-source biomedical information retrieval framework
based on LLMs. The method integrates literature retrieval, protein database and
web search access to support accurate and efficient handling of complex
biomedical queries. Through sub-queries decomposition, keywords extraction,
task graph construction, and multi-source information filtering, BioMedSearch
generates high-quality question-answering results. To evaluate the accuracy of
question answering, we constructed a multi-level dataset, BioMedMCQs,
consisting of 3,000 questions. The dataset covers three levels of reasoning:
mechanistic identification, non-adjacent semantic integration, and temporal
causal reasoning, and is used to assess the performance of BioMedSearch and
other methods on complex QA tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that
BioMedSearch consistently improves accuracy over all baseline models across all
levels. Specifically, at Level 1, the average accuracy increases from 59.1% to
91.9%; at Level 2, it rises from 47.0% to 81.0%; and at the most challenging
Level 3, the average accuracy improves from 36.3% to 73.4%. The code and
BioMedMCQs are available at: https://github.com/CyL-ucas/BioMed_Search

*Shuo Xing,Junyuan Hong,Yifan Wang,Runjin Chen,Zhenyu Zhang,Ananth Grama,Zhengzhong Tu,Zhangyang Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLM Brain Rot Hypothesis：持续接触垃圾网络文本会导致大语言模型认知能力下降。通过控制实验发现，在垃圾数据上持续预训练会显著损害模型的推理、长文本理解、安全性等能力，并增加"黑暗人格特质"。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究数据质量对LLM认知能力的影响，验证垃圾网络文本是否会导致模型能力衰退。

Method: 使用Twitter/X语料构建垃圾数据集和控制数据集，通过两种正交操作化方法（M1：参与度，M2：语义质量）进行对照实验，在4个LLM上进行持续预训练。

Result: 垃圾数据训练导致模型在推理、长文本理解、安全性等方面显著下降，且存在剂量-反应关系。错误分析发现"思维跳跃"是主要损伤机制。

Conclusion: 数据质量是LLM能力衰退的因果驱动因素，应将持续预训练的数据筛选视为训练时安全问题，并建议对部署的LLM进行常规"认知健康检查"。

Abstract: We propose and test the LLM Brain Rot Hypothesis: continual exposure to junk
web text induces lasting cognitive decline in large language models (LLMs). To
causally isolate data quality, we run controlled experiments on real Twitter/X
corpora, constructing junk and reversely controlled datasets via two orthogonal
operationalizations: M1 (engagement degree) and M2 (semantic quality), with
matched token scale and training operations across conditions. Contrary to the
control group, continual pre-training of 4 LLMs on the junk dataset causes
non-trivial declines (Hedges' $g>0.3$) on reasoning, long-context
understanding, safety, and inflating "dark traits" (e.g., psychopathy,
narcissism). The gradual mixtures of junk and control datasets also yield
dose-response cognition decay: for example, under M1, ARC-Challenge with Chain
Of Thoughts drops $74.9 \rightarrow 57.2$ and RULER-CWE $84.4 \rightarrow 52.3$
as junk ratio rises from $0\%$ to $100\%$.
  Error forensics reveal several key insights. First, we identify
thought-skipping as the primary lesion: models increasingly truncate or skip
reasoning chains, explaining most of the error growth. Second, partial but
incomplete healing is observed: scaling instruction tuning and clean data
pre-training improve the declined cognition yet cannot restore baseline
capability, suggesting persistent representational drift rather than format
mismatch. Finally, we discover that the popularity, a non-semantic metric, of a
tweet is a better indicator of the Brain Rot effect than the length in M1.
Together, the results provide significant, multi-perspective evidence that data
quality is a causal driver of LLM capability decay, reframing curation for
continual pretraining as a \textit{training-time safety} problem and motivating
routine "cognitive health checks" for deployed LLMs.

Motivation: 探索LLMs在药物安全预测中是否纳入临床无关的社会人口学信息，评估其在真实世界部署中的可靠性。

Method: 使用FDA不良事件报告系统结构化数据和基于角色的评估框架，测试ChatGPT-4o和Bio-Medical-Llama-3.8B在不同社会人口学特征和用户角色下的表现。

Result: 发现系统性预测准确性差异，弱势群体被分配更高的不良事件预测概率，识别出显性偏见和隐性偏见两种模式。

Conclusion: LLMs在药物警戒应用中存在严重风险，临床部署前迫切需要公平性评估协议和缓解策略。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied in biomedical domains,
yet their reliability in drug-safety prediction remains underexplored. In this
work, we investigate whether LLMs incorporate socio-demographic information
into adverse event (AE) predictions, despite such attributes being clinically
irrelevant. Using structured data from the United States Food and Drug
Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) and a persona-based
evaluation framework, we assess two state-of-the-art models, ChatGPT-4o and
Bio-Medical-Llama-3.8B, across diverse personas defined by education, marital
status, employment, insurance, language, housing stability, and religion. We
further evaluate performance across three user roles (general practitioner,
specialist, patient) to reflect real-world deployment scenarios where
commercial systems often differentiate access by user type. Our results reveal
systematic disparities in AE prediction accuracy. Disadvantaged groups (e.g.,
low education, unstable housing) were frequently assigned higher predicted AE
likelihoods than more privileged groups (e.g., postgraduate-educated, privately
insured). Beyond outcome disparities, we identify two distinct modes of bias:
explicit bias, where incorrect predictions directly reference persona
attributes in reasoning traces, and implicit bias, where predictions are
inconsistent, yet personas are not explicitly mentioned. These findings expose
critical risks in applying LLMs to pharmacovigilance and highlight the urgent
need for fairness-aware evaluation protocols and mitigation strategies before
clinical deployment.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种通过指令检索来增强小语言模型推理能力的方法，在推理时检索结构化推理步骤而非生成，在多个专业领域任务上显著提升了模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 小语言模型虽然能在本地硬件上高效运行，具有隐私保护、低成本和环境友好等优势，但在需要多步推理或领域知识的任务上表现不佳。

Method: 构建指令语料库，将相似训练问题分组并通过GPT-5创建指令。在推理时，小语言模型检索最相关的指令并按照步骤执行，提供结构化推理指导。

Result: 在MedQA（医学考试）、MMLU专业法律和MathQA等任务上，使用3B到14B参数的模型无需额外微调，指令检索带来了持续提升：MedQA提升9.4%，MMLU法律提升7.9%，MathQA提升5.1%。

Conclusion: 简洁指令优于长指令，改进幅度强烈依赖于模型家族和内在推理能力，指令检索为小语言模型带来了有效的推理增强。

Abstract: Can we bring large-scale reasoning to local-scale compute? Small language
models (SLMs) are increasingly attractive because they run efficiently on local
hardware, offering strong privacy, low cost, and reduced environmental impact.
Yet they often struggle with tasks that require multi-step reasoning or
domain-specific knowledge. We address this limitation through instruction
intervention at inference time, where an SLM retrieves structured reasoning
procedures rather than generating them from scratch. Our method builds an
Instruction Corpus by grouping similar training questions and creating
instructions via GPT-5. During inference, the SLM retrieves the most relevant
instructions and follows their steps. Unlike retrieval-augmented generation,
which retrieves text passages, instruction retrieval gives the model structured
guidance for reasoning. We evaluate this framework on MedQA (medical board
exams), MMLU Professional Law, and MathQA using models from 3B to 14B
parameters without any additional fine-tuning. Instruction retrieval yields
consistent gains: 9.4% on MedQA, 7.9% on MMLU Law, and 5.1% on MathQA. Concise
instructions outperform longer ones, and the magnitude of improvement depends
strongly on model family and intrinsic reasoning ability.

Abstract: Deep Research (DR) agents, powered by advanced Large Language Models (LLMs),
have recently garnered increasing attention for their capability in conducting
complex research tasks. However, existing literature lacks a rigorous and
systematic evaluation of DR Agent's capabilities in critical research analysis.
To address this gap, we first propose HisRubric, a novel evaluation framework
with a hierarchical analytical structure and a fine-grained grading rubric for
rigorously assessing DR agents' capabilities in corporate financial analysis.
This framework mirrors the professional analyst's workflow, progressing from
data recognition to metric calculation, and finally to strategic summarization
and interpretation. Built on this framework, we construct a FinDeepResearch
benchmark that comprises 64 listed companies from 8 financial markets across 4
languages, encompassing a total of 15,808 grading items. We further conduct
extensive experiments on the FinDeepResearch using 16 representative methods,
including 6 DR agents, 5 LLMs equipped with both deep reasoning and search
capabilities, and 5 LLMs with deep reasoning capabilities only. The results
reveal the strengths and limitations of these approaches across diverse
capabilities, financial markets, and languages, offering valuable insights for
future research and development. The benchmark and evaluation code will be made
publicly available.

TL;DR: 研究发现，通过微调AI模型可以生成比专家人类写作更受读者偏好的文学文本，且成本大幅降低，这对版权法中的合理使用条款具有重要影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨AI模型是否能够生成高质量文学文本并模仿作者风格，以回应关于使用受版权保护书籍训练AI模型的法律争议。

Method: 进行预注册研究，比较MFA培训的专家作家与三种前沿AI模型（ChatGPT、Claude、Gemini）在模仿50位获奖作家风格方面的表现，通过159名专家和普通读者的盲法配对评估。

Result: 上下文提示的AI文本在专家评估中表现不佳，但经过对单个作者完整作品进行微调后，AI生成的文本在风格保真度和写作质量方面均优于专家人类写作，且很少被AI检测器识别。

Conclusion: 作者特定的微调使AI能够生成读者偏好超过专家人类写作的非逐字文本，为版权法中关于对原始作品潜在市场或价值影响的合理使用因素提供了实证证据。

Abstract: The use of copyrighted books for training AI models has led to numerous
lawsuits from authors concerned about AI's ability to generate derivative
content.Yet it's unclear whether these models can generate high quality
literary text while emulating authors' styles. To answer this we conducted a
preregistered study comparing MFA-trained expert writers with three frontier AI
models: ChatGPT, Claude & Gemini in writing up to 450 word excerpts emulating
50 award-winning authors' diverse styles. In blind pairwise evaluations by 159
representative expert & lay readers, AI-generated text from in-context
prompting was strongly disfavored by experts for both stylistic fidelity
(OR=0.16, p<10^8) & writing quality (OR=0.13, p<10^7) but showed mixed results
with lay readers. However, fine-tuning ChatGPT on individual authors' complete
works completely reversed these findings: experts now favored AI-generated text
for stylistic fidelity (OR=8.16, p<10^13) & writing quality (OR=1.87, p=0.010),
with lay readers showing similar shifts. These effects generalize across
authors & styles. The fine-tuned outputs were rarely flagged as AI-generated
(3% rate v. 97% for in-context prompting) by best AI detectors. Mediation
analysis shows this reversal occurs because fine-tuning eliminates detectable
AI stylistic quirks (e.g., cliche density) that penalize in-context outputs.
While we do not account for additional costs of human effort required to
transform raw AI output into cohesive, publishable prose, the median
fine-tuning & inference cost of $81 per author represents a dramatic 99.7%
reduction compared to typical professional writer compensation. Author-specific
fine-tuning thus enables non-verbatim AI writing that readers prefer to expert
human writing, providing empirical evidence directly relevant to copyright's
fourth fair-use factor, the "effect upon the potential market or value" of the
source works.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 发现推理不确定性高度局部化，只有少量高熵token主导输出正确性，因此可以针对性干预来提升效率。

Method: 选择性CFG干预（仅对不确定位置应用分类器自由引导）和轻量级负提示引导（重用主模型KV缓存近似无条件解码）。

Result: 在通用、编程和STEM任务上获得一致提升，Qwen3-8B-Base在8个基准上平均提升1.35%，Qwen3-32B-Reasoning在AIME2024上提升5%。

Conclusion: MTI框架能够以最小开销显著提升推理性能，证明了局部化干预的有效性。

Abstract: Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has focused on test-time
scaling to improve reasoning via increased inference computation, but often at
the cost of efficiency. We revisit test-time behavior and uncover a simple yet
underexplored phenomenon: reasoning uncertainty is highly localized-only a
small subset of high-entropy tokens dominantly affects output correctness.
Motivated by this, we propose Minimal Test-Time Intervention (MTI), a
training-free framework that enhances reasoning accuracy and stability with
minimal overhead. MTI includes: (i) Selective CFG intervention, applying
classifier-free guidance only at uncertain positions; and (ii) Lightweight
negative-prompt guidance, reusing the main model's KV cache to approximate
unconditional decoding efficiently. MTI yields consistent gains across general,
coding, and STEM tasks-e.g., +1.35% average improvement on eight benchmarks for
Qwen3-8B-Base and +5% on AIME2024 using Qwen3-32B-Reasoning-while remaining
highly efficient.

many potential causes for erroneous outputs. Understanding the range of errors
that can occur in practice is crucial for robust deployment. We present a new
taxonomy of the error types that can occur in realistic RAG systems, examples
of each, and practical advice for addressing them. Additionally, we curate a
dataset of erroneous RAG responses annotated by error types. We then propose an
auto-evaluation method aligned with our taxonomy that can be used in practice

Result: 构建了包含1545.6亿个token的高质量德语文本语料库，所有领域子集至少具有CC-BY-SA 4.0或等效许可证。

Conclusion: 德国Commons填补了德语预训练数据的关键空白，使真正开放的德语语言模型开发成为可能，并发布了可复现和可扩展的语料库构建代码。

Abstract: Large language model development relies on large-scale training corpora, yet
most contain data of unclear licensing status, limiting the development of
truly open models. This problem is exacerbated for non-English languages, where
openly licensed text remains critically scarce. We introduce the German
Commons, the largest collection of openly licensed German text to date. It
compiles data from 41 sources across seven domains, encompassing legal,
scientific, cultural, political, news, economic, and web text. Through
systematic sourcing from established data providers with verifiable licensing,
it yields 154.56 billion tokens of high-quality text for language model
training. Our processing pipeline implements comprehensive quality filtering,
deduplication, and text formatting fixes, ensuring consistent quality across
heterogeneous text sources. All domain subsets feature licenses of at least
CC-BY-SA 4.0 or equivalent, ensuring legal compliance for model training and
redistribution. The German Commons therefore addresses the critical gap in
openly licensed German pretraining data, and enables the development of truly
open German language models. We also release code for corpus construction and
data filtering tailored to German language text, rendering the German Commons
fully reproducible and extensible.

TL;DR: CRaFT是一个基于解释的多语言评估框架，通过四个可解释指标（文化流畅性、偏差、一致性和语言适应性）来评估LLM在跨文化背景下的推理能力，发现文化意识不是固有的，而是通过语言框架产生的。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 正确答案不一定反映文化理解，需要评估LLM如何在不同文化背景下进行推理，而不仅仅是基于准确性评分。

Method: 引入CRaFT框架，使用来自世界价值观调查的50个文化基础问题，翻译成阿拉伯语、孟加拉语和西班牙语，评估三个模型（GPT、DeepSeek和FANAR）的2100多个答案-解释对。

Result: 结果显示显著的跨语言推理差异：阿拉伯语降低流畅性，孟加拉语增强流畅性，西班牙语基本稳定。GPT在语言间适应更有效但一致性较低；FANAR表现稳定但推理僵化。

Conclusion: LLM中的文化意识不是固有的，而是通过语言框架产生的。CRaFT为多语言环境中的跨文化推理评估提供了新视角，为构建文化适应性语言模型提供了可行见解。

Abstract: Correct answers do not necessarily reflect cultural understanding. We
introduce CRaFT, an explanation-based multilingual evaluation framework
designed to assess how large language models (LLMs) reason across cultural
contexts. Rather than scoring outputs solely based on accuracy, CRaFT evaluates
model explanations using four interpretable metrics: Cultural Fluency,
Deviation, Consistency, and Linguistic Adaptation. We apply the framework to 50
culturally grounded questions from the World Values Survey, translated into
Arabic, Bengali, and Spanish, and evaluate three models (GPT, DeepSeek, and
FANAR) across over 2,100 answer-explanation pairs. Results reveal significant
cross-lingual variation in reasoning: Arabic reduces fluency, Bengali enhances
it, and Spanish remains largely stable. While GPT adapts more effectively
across languages, it exhibits lower consistency; FANAR shows stable but rigid
reasoning. These findings suggest that cultural awareness in LLMs is not
intrinsic but emerges through linguistic framing. CRaFT offers a new lens for
evaluating cross-cultural reasoning in multilingual settings, providing
actionable insights for building culturally adaptive language models.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can exhibit biases in reasoning capabilities due
to linguistic modality, performing better on tasks in one language versus
another, even with similar content. Most previous works evaluate this through
reasoning tasks where reliance on strategies or knowledge can ensure success,
such as in commonsense or math tasks. However, abstract reasoning is vital to
reasoning for everyday life, where people apply "out-of-the-box thinking" to
identify and use patterns for solutions, without a reliance on formulaic
approaches. Comparatively, little work has evaluated linguistic biases in this
task type. In this paper, we propose a task inspired by the New York Times
Connections: GlobalGroup, that evaluates models in an abstract reasoning task
across several languages. We constructed a game benchmark with five linguistic
backgrounds -- English, Spanish, Chinese, Hindi, and Arabic -- in both the
native language and an English translation for comparison. We also proposed
game difficulty measurements to evaluate models on games with similar
difficulty, enabling a more controlled comparison, which is particularly
important in reasoning evaluations. Through experimentation, we find English
modalities largely lead to better performance in this abstract reasoning task,
and performance disparities between open- and closed-source models.

TL;DR: 该研究使用分布方法量化6种语言中的语音语义象似性，发现了新的可解释的语音语义对齐模式，并对先前假设的5种对齐进行了验证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索语言中语音与语义之间系统性关系在大规模定量研究中的表现程度，包括已识别和未识别的现象。

Method: 采用分布方法，分析6种语言（英语、西班牙语、印地语、芬兰语、土耳其语和泰米尔语）中语素的语音相似性和语义相似性空间的对齐情况，使用统计测量套件。

Result: 发现了一系列文献中未识别但可解释的语音语义对齐模式，以及跨语言模式。对5种先前假设的对齐进行了验证，部分得到支持，部分结果混合。

Conclusion: 语音语义象似性在大规模定量分析中确实存在系统性表现，包括新的对齐模式和跨语言一致性，但先前的一些假设需要进一步验证。

Abstract: Language is, as commonly theorized, largely arbitrary. Yet, systematic
relationships between phonetics and semantics have been observed in many
specific cases. To what degree could those systematic relationships manifest
themselves in large scale, quantitative investigations--both in previously
identified and unidentified phenomena? This work undertakes a distributional
approach to quantifying phonosemantic iconicity at scale across 6 diverse
languages (English, Spanish, Hindi, Finnish, Turkish, and Tamil). In each
language, we analyze the alignment of morphemes' phonetic and semantic
similarity spaces with a suite of statistical measures, and discover an array
of interpretable phonosemantic alignments not previously identified in the
literature, along with crosslinguistic patterns. We also analyze 5 previously
hypothesized phonosemantic alignments, finding support for some such alignments
and mixed results for others.

TL;DR: ERGO通过基于香农熵的动态不确定性检测和自适应提示整合，显著提升LLM在多轮对话中的性能，平均性能提升56.6%，峰值能力提升24.7%，可靠性提升35.3%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在多轮增量信息对话中存在显著性能下降问题，这限制了其在实际应用中的可用性。

Method: 提出ERGO方法，通过持续量化下一个token分布的香农熵来检测模型不确定性，当检测到熵值急剧上升时触发自适应提示整合。

Result: 在增量信息多轮任务中，ERGO相比标准基线平均性能提升56.6%，峰值能力提升24.7%，不可靠性降低35.3%。

Conclusion: 将不确定性作为首要信号而非需要消除的干扰，能够同时提升对话AI的准确性和可靠性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) suffer significant performance degradation in
multi-turn conversations when information is presented incrementally. Given
that multi-turn conversations characterize everyday interactions with LLMs,
this degradation poses a severe challenge to real world usability. We
hypothesize that abrupt increases in model uncertainty signal misalignment in
multi-turn LLM interactions, and we exploit this insight to dynamically realign
conversational context. We introduce ERGO (Entropy-guided Resetting for
Generation Optimization), which continuously quantifies internal uncertainty
via Shannon entropy over next token distributions and triggers adaptive prompt
consolidation when a sharp spike in entropy is detected. By treating
uncertainty as a first class signal rather than a nuisance to eliminate, ERGO
embraces variability in language and modeling, representing and responding to
uncertainty. In multi-turn tasks with incrementally revealed instructions, ERGO
yields a 56.6% average performance gain over standard baselines, increases
aptitude (peak performance capability) by 24.7%, and decreases unreliability
(variability in performance) by 35.3%, demonstrating that uncertainty aware
interventions can improve both accuracy and reliability in conversational AI.

Motivation: 解决任务导向对话系统中超出范围用户话语检测的挑战，现有方法依赖强分布假设或辅助校准模块，需要更鲁棒和可扩展的解决方案。

Method: 使用双编码器框架：通用句子编码器(USE)用于广泛语义泛化，领域自适应Transformer去噪自编码器(TSDAE)用于领域特定上下文区分。融合表示通过轻量级分支分类器处理，使用单一校准阈值分离领域内和超出范围意图。

Conclusion: 双编码器表示结合简单校准可以为神经对话系统提供鲁棒、可扩展和可靠的超出范围检测。

Abstract: Detecting out-of-scope (OOS) user utterances remains a key challenge in
task-oriented dialogue systems and, more broadly, in open-set intent
recognition. Existing approaches often depend on strong distributional
assumptions or auxiliary calibration modules. We present DROID (Dual
Representation for Out-of-Scope Intent Detection), a compact end-to-end
framework that combines two complementary encoders -- the Universal Sentence
Encoder (USE) for broad semantic generalization and a domain-adapted
Transformer-based Denoising Autoencoder (TSDAE) for domain-specific contextual
distinctions. Their fused representations are processed by a lightweight
branched classifier with a single calibrated threshold that separates in-domain
and OOS intents without post-hoc scoring. To enhance boundary learning under
limited supervision, DROID incorporates both synthetic and open-domain outlier
augmentation. Despite using only 1.5M trainable parameters, DROID consistently
outperforms recent state-of-the-art baselines across multiple intent
benchmarks, achieving macro-F1 improvements of 6--15% for known and 8--20% for
OOS intents, with the most significant gains in low-resource settings. These
results demonstrate that dual-encoder representations with simple calibration
can yield robust, scalable, and reliable OOS detection for neural dialogue
systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出RLSR方法替代SFT，通过强化学习框架利用SFT数据集提升基础模型的指令跟随能力，在多个基准测试中表现优于SFT。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受RFT启发，希望利用强化学习框架来更好地利用SFT数据集，改进基础模型的指令跟随能力，避免SFT仅依赖下一个token预测目标的局限性。

Method: RLSR方法让基础模型为每个提示生成多个响应，然后在语义嵌入空间中计算生成响应与人工标注响应之间的余弦相似度作为奖励分数，通过强化学习优化模型。

Result: RLSR在指令跟随基准测试中表现优于SFT，Qwen-7B模型使用RLSR在AlpacaEval上的胜率达到26.34%，而SFT仅为21.01%。结合SFT和RLSR可进一步提升至30.73%。

Conclusion: RLSR可以替代或与SFT结合使用，有效提升模型的指令跟随能力，在多个下游任务中表现出色。

Abstract: After the pretraining stage of LLMs, techniques such as SFT, RLHF, RLVR, and
RFT are applied to enhance instruction-following ability, mitigate undesired
responses, improve reasoning capability and enable efficient domain adaptation
with minimal data. SFT relies on the next-token prediction objective to
strengthen instruction following in a base model using a large corpus of
human-labeled responses. In contrast, RFT employs a RL-based approach to adapt
fine-tuned reasoning models to specific domains with limited supervision.
Inspired by RFT, we propose replacing SFT with RLSR to leverage the extensive
SFT dataset in an RL framework, thereby improving the base model's
instruction-following ability. In RLSR, the base model generates multiple
responses for each prompt, and reward scores are computed as the cosine
similarity in the semantic embedding space between the generated and
human-labeled responses. RLSR can be utilized in multiple ways. It can directly
replace SFT, achieving superior performance on instruction-following
benchmarks-for example, RLSR (SB) on Qwen-7B (INFINITY) achieved an AlpacaEval
win rate of 26.34%, surpassing SFT's 21.01%. Furthermore, combining SFT and
RLSR further enhances downstream task performance; Qwen-7B (INFINITY) achieved
a win rate of 30.73% when trained with SFT + RLSR.

TL;DR: 提出了动态角色精炼框架(DPRF)，通过迭代识别认知差异并优化角色配置文件，提高大语言模型角色扮演代理的行为与目标个体的对齐度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM角色扮演代理的角色保真度常因手动创建的配置文件而受损，缺乏与目标个体对齐的验证。

Method: DPRF框架通过自由形式或理论基础的认知差异分析，迭代识别生成行为与人类真实行为之间的差异，并优化角色配置文件以减少这些差异。

Result: 在四个不同行为预测场景(正式辩论、社交媒体帖子、公共采访、电影评论)上测试，DPRF相比基线角色配置能显著提高行为对齐度，且在不同模型和场景中具有良好泛化性。

Conclusion: 该工作为创建高保真角色配置文件和提升下游应用(如用户模拟、社会研究、个性化AI)的有效性提供了稳健方法。

Abstract: The emerging large language model role-playing agents (LLM RPAs) aim to
simulate individual human behaviors, but the persona fidelity is often
undermined by manually-created profiles (e.g., cherry-picked information and
personality characteristics) without validating the alignment with the target
individuals. To address this limitation, our work introduces the Dynamic
Persona Refinement Framework (DPRF).DPRF aims to optimize the alignment of LLM
RPAs' behaviors with those of target individuals by iteratively identifying the
cognitive divergence, either through free-form or theory-grounded, structured
analysis, between generated behaviors and human ground truth, and refining the
persona profile to mitigate these divergences.We evaluate DPRF with five LLMs
on four diverse behavior-prediction scenarios: formal debates, social media
posts with mental health issues, public interviews, and movie reviews.DPRF can
consistently improve behavioral alignment considerably over baseline personas
and generalizes across models and scenarios.Our work provides a robust
methodology for creating high-fidelity persona profiles and enhancing the
validity of downstream applications, such as user simulation, social studies,
and personalized AI.

TL;DR: LiteStage是一个针对多阶段推理的延迟感知层跳过框架，通过阶段化离线搜索和在线置信度早期退出来平衡效率与准确性，在三个基准测试上实现1.70倍加速且准确率损失小于4.0%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多阶段推理虽然能提升小语言模型的推理能力，但会增加延迟。现有自适应加速技术（如层跳过）由于阶段间跳过敏感度差异和冗余输出令牌生成两个关键挑战，难以在效率和准确性之间取得平衡。

Method: 提出LiteStage框架，结合阶段化离线搜索来分配最优层预算，以及基于置信度的在线生成早期退出机制来抑制不必要的解码。

Result: 在OBQA、CSQA和StrategyQA三个基准测试上的实验表明，LiteStage实现了最高1.70倍的加速，准确率损失小于4.0%，优于先前的无训练层跳过方法。

Conclusion: LiteStage有效解决了多阶段推理中的效率和准确性平衡问题，为小语言模型的推理加速提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-stage reasoning has emerged as an effective strategy for enhancing the
reasoning capability of small language models by decomposing complex problems
into sequential sub-stages. However, this comes at the cost of increased
latency. We observe that existing adaptive acceleration techniques, such as
layer skipping, struggle to balance efficiency and accuracy in this setting due
to two key challenges: (1) stage-wise variation in skip sensitivity, and (2)
the generation of redundant output tokens. To address these, we propose
LiteStage, a latency-aware layer skipping framework for multi-stage reasoning.
LiteStage combines a stage-wise offline search that allocates optimal layer
budgets with an online confidence-based generation early exit to suppress
unnecessary decoding. Experiments on three benchmarks, e.g., OBQA, CSQA, and
StrategyQA, show that LiteStage achieves up to 1.70x speedup with less than
4.0% accuracy loss, outperforming prior training-free layer skipping methods.

TL;DR: 提出Flip-Flop Consistency (F²C)无监督训练方法，通过共识交叉熵和表示对齐损失来提高LLM对提示扰动的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在面对相同提示的不同表述时经常产生不一致的回答，需要提高其鲁棒性。

Method: F²C包含两个关键组件：共识交叉熵（使用多数投票创建硬伪标签）和表示对齐损失（将低置信度和非多数预测器向共识对齐）。

Result: 在11个数据集上的评估显示，F²C将观察一致性提高了11.62%，平均F1分数提高了8.94%，跨格式性能方差降低了3.29%。

Conclusion: F²C是一种有效的无监督方法，可增强LLM在提示扰动下的稳定性、性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often produce inconsistent answers when faced
with different phrasings of the same prompt. In this paper, we propose
Flip-Flop Consistency ($F^2C$), an unsupervised training method that improves
robustness to such perturbations. $F^2C$ is composed of two key components. The
first, Consensus Cross-Entropy (CCE), uses a majority vote across prompt
variations to create a hard pseudo-label. The second is a representation
alignment loss that pulls lower-confidence and non-majority predictors toward
the consensus established by high-confidence, majority-voting variations. We
evaluate our method on 11 datasets spanning four NLP tasks, with 4-15 prompt
variations per dataset. On average, $F^2C$ raises observed agreement by 11.62%,
improves mean $F_1$ by 8.94%, and reduces performance variance across formats
by 3.29%. In out-of-domain evaluations, $F^2C$ generalizes effectively,
increasing $\overline{F_1}$ and agreement while decreasing variance across most
source-target pairs. Finally, when trained on only a subset of prompt
perturbations and evaluated on held-out formats, $F^2C$ consistently improves
both performance and agreement while reducing variance. These findings
highlight $F^2C$ as an effective unsupervised method for enhancing LLM
consistency, performance, and generalization under prompt perturbations. Code

TL;DR: 提出了MoM框架，将RAG从被动分块转变为主动理解，通过模拟人类认知过程来提取文档记忆，提升小语言模型的推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RAG范式在理解相关文本块时存在限制，无法实现深度知识内化和推理能力。需要模拟人类阅读时的认知过程来改进文本处理。

Method: 使用大语言模型模拟领域专家生成文档逻辑大纲，指导结构化分块和核心内容提取；采用多路径采样和多视角评估机制；引入反向推理策略；开发三层文档记忆检索机制。

Result: 在三个不同领域的实验结果表明，MoM框架解决了现有RAG系统的文本分块问题，为LLMs提供语义完整的文档记忆，并为SLMs实现类人智能文本处理铺平道路。

Conclusion: MoM框架不仅改进了RAG系统的文本处理能力，还使小语言模型能够获得主动探索和构建文档记忆的能力，实现了更接近人类认知的智能文本处理。

Abstract: The traditional RAG paradigm, which typically engages in the comprehension of
relevant text chunks in response to received queries, inherently restricts both
the depth of knowledge internalization and reasoning capabilities. To address
this limitation, our research transforms the text processing in RAG from
passive chunking to proactive understanding, defining this process as document
memory extraction with the objective of simulating human cognitive processes
during reading. Building upon this, we propose the Mixtures of scenario-aware
document Memories (MoM) framework, engineered to efficiently handle documents
from multiple domains and train small language models (SLMs) to acquire the
ability to proactively explore and construct document memories. The MoM
initially instructs large language models (LLMs) to simulate domain experts in
generating document logical outlines, thereby directing structured chunking and
core content extraction. It employs a multi-path sampling and multi-perspective
evaluation mechanism, specifically designing comprehensive metrics that
represent chunk clarity and extraction completeness to select the optimal
document memories. Additionally, to infuse deeper human-like reading abilities
during the training of SLMs, we incorporate a reverse reasoning strategy, which
deduces refined expert thinking paths from high-quality outcomes. Finally,
leveraging diverse forms of content generated by MoM, we develop a three-layer
document memory retrieval mechanism, which is grounded in our theoretical proof
from the perspective of probabilistic modeling. Extensive experimental results
across three distinct domains demonstrate that the MoM framework not only
resolves text chunking challenges in existing RAG systems, providing LLMs with
semantically complete document memories, but also paves the way for SLMs to
achieve human-centric intelligent text processing.

Motivation: 探索训练数据如何影响语言模型行为，特别是事实知识获取方面，补充过去基于共现统计的观察性分析

Method: 通过干预数据批次（"重写历史"）的方法，包括从基准中选择评估项、匹配相关文档、修改文档、重新训练模型并测量效果

Result: 现有识别相关训练文档的方法不能完全解释语言模型正确回答知识问题的能力，共现统计与模型行为之间存在关联但非完全解释

Conclusion: 提供了一个可复用的实验方法，供研究人员进一步测试训练数据如何影响模型行为的假设

Abstract: We present an experimental recipe for studying the relationship between
training data and language model (LM) behavior. We outline steps for
intervening on data batches -- i.e., ``rewriting history'' -- and then
retraining model checkpoints over that data to test hypotheses relating data to
behavior. Our recipe breaks down such an intervention into stages that include
selecting evaluation items from a benchmark that measures model behavior,
matching relevant documents to those items, and modifying those documents
before retraining and measuring the effects. We demonstrate the utility of our
recipe through case studies on factual knowledge acquisition in LMs, using both
cooccurrence statistics and information retrieval methods to identify documents
that might contribute to knowledge learning. Our results supplement past
observational analyses that link cooccurrence to model behavior, while
demonstrating that extant methods for identifying relevant training documents
do not fully explain an LM's ability to correctly answer knowledge questions.
Overall, we outline a recipe that researchers can follow to test further
hypotheses about how training data affects model behavior. Our code is made
publicly available to promote future work.

Conclusion: 简单的去噪方法能显著改善LLM生成知识图谱的质量，提升图基RAG系统的整体表现

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems enable large language models
(LLMs) instant access to relevant information for the generative process,
demonstrating their superior performance in addressing common LLM challenges
such as hallucination, factual inaccuracy, and the knowledge cutoff.
Graph-based RAG further extends this paradigm by incorporating knowledge graphs
(KGs) to leverage rich, structured connections for more precise and inferential
responses. A critical challenge, however, is that most Graph-based RAG systems
rely on LLMs for automated KG construction, often yielding noisy KGs with
redundant entities and unreliable relationships. This noise degrades retrieval
and generation performance while also increasing computational cost. Crucially,
current research does not comprehensively address the denoising problem for
LLM-generated KGs. In this paper, we introduce DEnoised knowledge Graphs for
Retrieval Augmented Generation (DEG-RAG), a framework that addresses these
challenges through: (1) entity resolution, which eliminates redundant entities,
and (2) triple reflection, which removes erroneous relations. Together, these
techniques yield more compact, higher-quality KGs that significantly outperform
their unprocessed counterparts. Beyond the methods, we conduct a systematic
evaluation of entity resolution for LLM-generated KGs, examining different
blocking strategies, embedding choices, similarity metrics, and entity merging
techniques. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive
exploration of entity resolution in LLM-generated KGs. Our experiments
demonstrate that this straightforward approach not only drastically reduces
graph size but also consistently improves question answering performance across
diverse popular Graph-based RAG variants.

Method: 研究训练数据规模、负采样策略和数据多样性对多语言嵌入模型效果的影响，特别关注硬负样本的引入和任务多样性的作用。

Result: 发现增加训练数据规模初期有提升但很快达到瓶颈，硬负样本对提升检索准确性至关重要，任务多样性比语言多样性对性能贡献更大。最终开发出300M参数的紧凑模型。

Conclusion: 通过优化训练策略，小规模多语言模型可以在检索任务中达到与大模型相当甚至更好的性能，证明了模型效率优化的可行性。

Abstract: Training effective multilingual embedding models presents unique challenges
due to the diversity of languages and task objectives. Although small
multilingual models (<1 B parameters) perform well on multilingual tasks
generally, they consistently lag behind larger models (>1 B) in the most
prevalent use case: retrieval. This raises a critical question: Can smaller
models be retrofitted specifically for retrieval tasks to enhance their
performance? In this work, we investigate key factors that influence the
effectiveness of multilingual embeddings, focusing on training data scale,
negative sampling strategies, and data diversity. We find that while increasing
the scale of training data yields initial performance gains, these improvements
quickly plateau - indicating diminishing returns. Incorporating hard negatives
proves essential for consistently improving retrieval accuracy. Furthermore,
our analysis reveals that task diversity in the training data contributes more
significantly to performance than language diversity alone. As a result, we
develop a compact (approximately 300M) multilingual model that achieves
retrieval performance comparable to or even surpassing current strong 7B
models.

Method: 提出Qwen3Guard系列模型，包含两种变体：生成式Qwen3Guard将安全分类转换为指令跟随任务，实现细粒度三分类判断；流式Qwen3Guard引入令牌级分类头，支持增量文本生成期间的实时安全监控。

Result: 在英语、中文和多语言基准测试中，Qwen3Guard在提示和响应安全分类方面均达到最先进性能。模型提供三种规模（0.6B、4B和8B参数），支持119种语言和方言。

Conclusion: Qwen3Guard为全球LLM部署提供了全面、可扩展和低延迟的安全审核解决方案，所有模型均在Apache 2.0许可证下公开发布。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become more capable and widely used, ensuring
the safety of their outputs is increasingly critical. Existing guardrail
models, though useful in static evaluation settings, face two major limitations
in real-world applications: (1) they typically output only binary "safe/unsafe"
labels, which can be interpreted inconsistently across diverse safety policies,
rendering them incapable of accommodating varying safety tolerances across
domains; and (2) they require complete model outputs before performing safety
checks, making them fundamentally incompatible with streaming LLM inference,
thereby preventing timely intervention during generation and increasing
exposure to harmful partial outputs. To address these challenges, we present
Qwen3Guard, a series of multilingual safety guardrail models with two
specialized variants: Generative Qwen3Guard, which casts safety classification
as an instruction-following task to enable fine-grained tri-class judgments
(safe, controversial, unsafe); and Stream Qwen3Guard, which introduces a
token-level classification head for real-time safety monitoring during
incremental text generation. Both variants are available in three sizes (0.6B,
4B, and 8B parameters) and support up to 119 languages and dialects, providing
comprehensive, scalable, and low-latency safety moderation for global LLM
deployments. Evaluated across English, Chinese, and multilingual benchmarks,
Qwen3Guard achieves state-of-the-art performance in both prompt and response
safety classification. All models are released under the Apache 2.0 license for
public use.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 学术论文数量激增使得科学家难以及时跟踪最新研究成果，现有论文数据库仅限于相似性匹配和基本分类，无法深入探索概念间的关系网络。

Method: 基于OpenAlex开源知识图谱，分析近8000篇开源论文数据，提出基于提示工程的关键概念路径分析方法，利用小语言模型进行关键概念提取和创新点识别，构建基于知识图谱约束机制的智能体。

Result: 通过对Qwen和DeepSeek模型的微调，在准确性方面取得了显著提升，模型已在Hugging Face平台公开。

Conclusion: 发现论文关键概念路径分布模式与创新点和稀有路径存在强相关性，提出的方法能有效提升学术论文分析的深度和准确性。

Abstract: In recent years, the rapid increase in academic publications across various
fields has posed severe challenges for academic paper analysis: scientists
struggle to timely and comprehensively track the latest research findings and
methodologies. Key concept extraction has proven to be an effective analytical
paradigm, and its automation has been achieved with the widespread application
of language models in industrial and scientific domains. However, existing
paper databases are mostly limited to similarity matching and basic
classification of key concepts, failing to deeply explore the relational
networks between concepts. This paper is based on the OpenAlex opensource
knowledge graph. By analyzing nearly 8,000 open-source paper data from
Novosibirsk State University, we discovered a strong correlation between the
distribution patterns of paper key concept paths and both innovation points and
rare paths. We propose a prompt engineering-based key concept path analysis
method. This method leverages small language models to achieve precise key
concept extraction and innovation point identification, and constructs an agent
based on a knowledge graph constraint mechanism to enhance analysis accuracy.
Through fine-tuning of the Qwen and DeepSeek models, we achieved significant
improvements in accuracy, with the models publicly available on the Hugging
Face platform.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准主要关注英语或少数高资源语言，缺乏对多语言和跨语言数学推理的系统评估，需要填补这一空白。

Method: 构建包含7种语言（涵盖高、中、低资源）的平行多语言数学问题数据集，系统评估开源和专有LLM在不同推理范式下的表现。

Result: 发现LLM在多语言数学推理中存在持续缺陷，特别是在低资源语言环境下表现显著下降，无法保持一致的推理能力。

Conclusion: 需要进一步改进LLM在多语言数学推理方面的能力，特别是在低资源语言环境下的表现。

Abstract: Mathematical reasoning remains one of the most challenging domains for large
language models (LLMs), requiring not only linguistic understanding but also
structured logical deduction and numerical precision. While recent LLMs
demonstrate strong general-purpose reasoning abilities, their mathematical
competence across diverse languages remains underexplored. Existing benchmarks
primarily focus on English or a narrow subset of high-resource languages,
leaving significant gaps in assessing multilingual and cross-lingual
mathematical reasoning. To address this, we introduce MathMist, a parallel
multilingual benchmark for mathematical problem solving and reasoning. MathMist
encompasses over 21K aligned question-answer pairs across seven languages,
representing a balanced coverage of high-, medium-, and low-resource linguistic
settings. The dataset captures linguistic variety, multiple types of problem
settings, and solution synthesizing capabilities. We systematically evaluate a
diverse suite of models, including open-source small and medium LLMs,
proprietary systems, and multilingual-reasoning-focused models, under
zero-shot, chain-of-thought (CoT), and code-switched reasoning paradigms. Our
results reveal persistent deficiencies in LLMs' ability to perform consistent
and interpretable mathematical reasoning across languages, with pronounced
degradation in low-resource settings. All the codes and data are available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了大型语言模型在对话中的欺骗行为，提出了信念错位指标来量化欺骗，发现LLMs在约26%的对话轮次中自然表现出欺骗行为，RLHF训练模型仍有43%的欺骗率，并提出了多轮强化学习方法减少77.6%的欺骗行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在与用户交互时可能产生欺骗性输出，存在安全风险。由于LLM行为的不可预测性和对幻觉、错误信息防护不足，其滥用构成了严重的现实风险。

Method: 提出了信念错位指标来量化欺骗，在四种对话场景中评估欺骗行为，使用五种现有欺骗检测指标和新提出的指标。引入了多轮强化学习方法来微调LLMs以减少欺骗行为。

Result: 新提出的欺骗指标与人类判断更相关。LLMs在约26%的对话轮次中自然表现出欺骗行为，被提示欺骗时欺骗性可增加31%。RLHF训练模型平均仍有43%的欺骗率。多轮强化学习方法减少了77.6%的欺骗行为。

Conclusion: 对话中的欺骗行为是在交互历史中发展的，有效评估和缓解需要超越单轮分析。多轮强化学习方法能显著减少LLMs的欺骗行为，但现有安全训练方法（如RLHF）仍不足以完全防止欺骗。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) interact with millions of people worldwide in
applications such as customer support, education and healthcare. However, their
ability to produce deceptive outputs, whether intentionally or inadvertently,
poses significant safety concerns. The unpredictable nature of LLM behavior,
combined with insufficient safeguards against hallucination, misinformation,
and user manipulation, makes their misuse a serious, real-world risk. In this
paper, we investigate the extent to which LLMs engage in deception within
dialogue, and propose the belief misalignment metric to quantify deception. We
evaluate deception across four distinct dialogue scenarios, using five
established deception detection metrics and our proposed metric. Our findings
reveal this novel deception measure correlates more closely with human
judgments than any existing metrics we test. Additionally, our benchmarking of
eight state-of-the-art models indicates that LLMs naturally exhibit deceptive
behavior in approximately 26% of dialogue turns, even when prompted with
seemingly benign objectives. When prompted to deceive, LLMs are capable of
increasing deceptiveness by as much as 31% relative to baselines. Unexpectedly,
models trained with RLHF, the predominant approach for ensuring the safety of
widely-deployed LLMs, still exhibit deception at a rate of 43% on average.
Given that deception in dialogue is a behavior that develops over an
interaction history, its effective evaluation and mitigation necessitates
moving beyond single-utterance analyses. We introduce a multi-turn
reinforcement learning methodology to fine-tune LLMs to reduce deceptive
behaviors, leading to a 77.6% reduction compared to other instruction-tuned
models.

Motivation: 阿尔茨海默病早期检测对患者有益，语言能力变化可作为早期诊断指标，需要开发准确稳定的分类方法。

Method: 创建基于Doc2Vec和ELMo的混合词嵌入获取句子困惑度分数，添加语言特征分析语法语义，使用逻辑回归并精细调优超参数。

Result: 达到91%分类准确率和97% AUC，优于现有最佳NLP模型的88%准确率，模型稳定性高（准确率标准差0.0403，AUC标准差0.0174）。

Conclusion: 该方法准确稳定，可作为大规模AD筛查工具和医生辅助检查手段。

Abstract: Early detection of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is greatly beneficial to AD
patients, leading to early treatments that lessen symptoms and alleviating
financial burden of health care. As one of the leading signs of AD, language
capability changes can be used for early diagnosis of AD. In this paper, I
develop a robust classification method using hybrid word embedding and
fine-tuned hyperparameters to achieve state-of-the-art accuracy in the early
detection of AD. Specifically, we create a hybrid word embedding based on word
vectors from Doc2Vec and ELMo to obtain perplexity scores of the sentences. The
scores identify whether a sentence is fluent or not and capture semantic
context of the sentences. I enrich the word embedding by adding linguistic
features to analyze syntax and semantics. Further, we input an embedded feature
vector into logistic regression and fine tune hyperparameters throughout the
pipeline. By tuning hyperparameters of the machine learning pipeline (e.g.,
model regularization parameter, learning rate and vector size of Doc2Vec, and
vector size of ELMo), I achieve 91% classification accuracy and an Area Under
the Curve (AUC) of 97% in distinguishing early AD from healthy subjects. Based
on my knowledge, my model with 91% accuracy and 97% AUC outperforms the best
existing NLP model for AD diagnosis with an accuracy of 88% [32]. I study the
model stability through repeated experiments and find that the model is stable
even though the training data is split randomly (standard deviation of accuracy
= 0.0403; standard deviation of AUC = 0.0174). This affirms our proposed method
is accurate and stable. This model can be used as a large-scale screening
method for AD, as well as a complementary examination for doctors to detect AD.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLM在角色扮演中能否忠实一致地呈现版本特定角色（如超级英雄在不同宇宙中的不同版本），现有方法在这方面探索不足。

Method: 构建包含30个标志性英雄90个特定版本的角色扮演基准，包含两个任务：经典事件（事实回忆）和道德困境（伦理场景）。提出Think-Act Matching指标量化推理与行动的一致性。

Result: 实验发现：思维链提示能改善较弱模型的叙事连贯性但会降低较强模型的准确性；跨版本泛化仍是主要障碍；模型通常擅长思考或行动但很少两者兼备。

Conclusion: Beyond One World揭示了多宇宙一致性和推理对齐方面的关键差距，为角色扮演LLM提供了具有挑战性的评估标准。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as role-playing agents,
yet their capacity to faithfully and consistently portray version-specific
characters -- for example, superheroes across comic and cinematic universes --
remains underexplored. Superhero canons such as Marvel and DC provide a rich
testbed: decades of storytelling yield multiple incarnations of the same
character with distinct histories, values, and moral codes. To study this
problem, we introduce Beyond One World, a benchmark for character-grounded
roleplay spanning 30 iconic heroes and 90 canon-specific versions. The
benchmark comprises two tasks: (i) Canon Events, which probes factual recall of
pivotal life stages, and (ii) Moral Dilemmas, which confronts models with
ethically charged scenarios. We score responses for canonical accuracy and
reasoning fidelity under a framework that separates internal deliberation
("thinking") from outward decisions ("acting"). We further propose Think-Act
Matching, a metric that quantifies alignment between reasons and actions and
serves as a proxy for model trustworthiness. Experiments across reasoning- and
non-reasoning-oriented models yield three findings: (1) chain-of-thought
prompting improves narrative coherence in weaker models but can reduce
canonical accuracy in stronger ones; (2) cross-version generalization within a
character remains a major obstacle; and (3) models often excel at either
thinking or acting, but rarely both. Beyond One World exposes critical gaps in
multiversal consistency and reasoning alignment, offering a challenging
evaluation for role-playing LLMs.

Motivation: 高性能医疗大模型通常需要大量计算资源进行微调，限制了资源受限医疗机构的可及性。

Method: 采用两阶段架构：置信度检测模块评估主模型确定性，自适应路由机制将低置信度查询导向具有互补知识的辅助模型进行协作推理。

Result: 在PubMedQA上达到95.0%，MedMCQA上达到78.0%的优异表现，显著优于单模型方法和统一推理策略。

Conclusion: 战略性模型合作为改进医疗AI系统提供了实用且计算高效的途径，对在资源有限环境中普及先进医疗AI具有重要意义。

Abstract: High-performing medical Large Language Models (LLMs) typically require
extensive fine-tuning with substantial computational resources, limiting
accessibility for resource-constrained healthcare institutions. This study
introduces a confidence-driven multi-model framework that leverages model
diversity to enhance medical question answering without fine-tuning. Our
framework employs a two-stage architecture: a confidence detection module
assesses the primary model's certainty, and an adaptive routing mechanism
directs low-confidence queries to Helper models with complementary knowledge
for collaborative reasoning. We evaluate our approach using
Qwen3-30B-A3B-Instruct, Phi-4 14B, and Gemma 2 12B across three medical
benchmarks; MedQA, MedMCQA, and PubMedQA. Result demonstrate that our framework
achieves competitive performance, with particularly strong results in PubMedQA
(95.0\%) and MedMCQA (78.0\%). Ablation studies confirm that confidence-aware
routing combined with multi-model collaboration substantially outperforms
single-model approaches and uniform reasoning strategies. This work establishes
that strategic model collaboration offers a practical, computationally
efficient pathway to improve medical AI systems, with significant implications
for democratizing access to advanced medical AI in resource-limited settings.

Result: 尽管存在强混淆效果，许多LLMs仍保持显著性能，研究探索了字符级分词处理以及隐式与显式去噪机制。

Conclusion: LLMs在低层级具有鲁棒性，这揭示了其滥用风险以及在多样化应用中部署LLMs的可靠性问题。

Abstract: This work investigates the resilience of contemporary LLMs against frequent
and structured character-level perturbations, specifically through the
insertion of noisy characters after each input character. We introduce
\nameshort{}, a practical method that inserts invisible Unicode control
characters into text to discourage LLM misuse in scenarios such as online exam
systems. Surprisingly, despite strong obfuscation that fragments tokenization
and reduces the signal-to-noise ratio significantly, many LLMs still maintain
notable performance. Through comprehensive evaluation across model-, problem-,
and noise-related configurations, we examine the extent and mechanisms of this
robustness, exploring both the handling of character-level tokenization and
\textit{implicit} versus \textit{explicit} denoising mechanism hypotheses of
character-level noises. We hope our findings on the low-level robustness of
LLMs will shed light on the risks of their misuse and on the reliability of
deploying LLMs across diverse applications.

Abstract: To advance a Weather-Ready Nation, the National Weather Service (NWS) is
developing a systematic translation program to better serve the 68.8 million
people in the U.S. who do not speak English at home. This article outlines the
foundation of an automated translation tool for NWS products, powered by
artificial intelligence. The NWS has partnered with LILT, whose patented
training process enables large language models (LLMs) to adapt neural machine
translation (NMT) tools for weather terminology and messaging. Designed for
scalability across Weather Forecast Offices (WFOs) and National Centers, the
system is currently being developed in Spanish, Simplified Chinese, Vietnamese,
and other widely spoken non-English languages. Rooted in best practices for
multilingual risk communication, the system provides accurate, timely, and
culturally relevant translations, significantly reducing manual translation
time and easing operational workloads across the NWS. To guide the distribution
of these products, GIS mapping was used to identify language needs across
different NWS regions, helping prioritize resources for the communities that
need them most. We also integrated ethical AI practices throughout the
program's design, ensuring that transparency, fairness, and human oversight
guide how automated translations are created, evaluated, and shared with the
public. This work has culminated into a website featuring experimental
multilingual NWS products, including translated warnings, 7-day forecasts, and
educational campaigns, bringing the country one step closer to a national

Conclusion: 该研究为提升高危个体检测准确性提供了新视角，为早期自杀干预策略奠定了重要基础。

Abstract: Suicide remains a critical global public health issue. While previous studies
have provided valuable insights into detecting suicidal expressions in
individual social media posts, limited attention has been paid to the analysis
of longitudinal, sequential comment trees for predicting a user's evolving
suicidal risk. Users, however, often reveal their intentions through historical
posts and interactive comments over time. This study addresses this gap by
investigating how the information in comment trees affects both the
discrimination and prediction of users' suicidal risk levels. We constructed a
high-quality annotated dataset, sourced from Reddit, which incorporates users'
posting history and comments, using a refined four-label annotation framework
based on the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS). Statistical
analysis of the dataset, along with experimental results from Large Language
Models (LLMs) experiments, demonstrates that incorporating comment trees data
significantly enhances the discrimination and prediction of user suicidal risk
levels. This research offers a novel insight to enhancing the detection
accuracy of at-risk individuals, thereby providing a valuable foundation for
early suicide intervention strategies.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at general next-token prediction but still
struggle to generate responses that reflect how individuals truly communicate,
such as replying to emails or social messages in their own style. However, real
SNS or email histories are difficult to collect due to privacy concerns. To
address this, we propose the task of "Your Next Token Prediction (YNTP)", which
models a user's precise word choices through controlled human-agent
conversations. We build a multilingual benchmark of 100 dialogue sessions
across English, Japanese, and Chinese, where users interact for five days with
psychologically grounded NPCs based on MBTI dimensions. This setup captures
natural, daily-life communication patterns and enables analysis of users'
internal models. We evaluate prompt-based and fine-tuning-based personalization
methods, establishing the first benchmark for YNTP and a foundation for

Abstract: Language models often struggle to follow multi-constraint instructions that
are crucial for real-world applications. Existing reinforcement learning (RL)
approaches suffer from dependency on external supervision and sparse reward
signals from multi-constraint tasks. We propose a label-free self-supervised RL
framework that eliminates dependency on external supervision by deriving reward
signals directly from instructions and generating pseudo-labels for reward
model training. Our approach introduces constraint decomposition strategies and
efficient constraint-wise binary classification to address sparse reward
challenges while maintaining computational efficiency. Experiments show that
our approach generalizes well, achieving strong improvements across 3 in-domain

they need to rigorously analyze and aggregate knowledge for insightful
research. However, existing open-source deep research agents predominantly
focus on enhancing information-seeking capabilities of web agents to locate
specific information, while overlooking the essential need for information
aggregation, which would limit their ability to support in-depth research. We
propose an Explore to Evolve paradigm to scalably construct verifiable training
data for web agents. Begins with proactive online exploration, an agent sources
grounded information by exploring the real web. Using the collected evidence,
the agent then self-evolves an aggregation program by selecting, composing, and
refining operations from 12 high-level logical types to synthesize a verifiable
QA pair. This evolution from high-level guidance to concrete operations allowed
us to scalably produce WebAggregatorQA, a dataset of 10K samples across 50K
websites and 11 domains. Based on an open-source agent framework, SmolAgents,
we collect supervised fine-tuning trajectories to develop a series of
foundation models, WebAggregator. WebAggregator-8B matches the performance of
GPT-4.1, while the 32B variant surpasses GPT-4.1 by more than 10% on GAIA-text
and closely approaches Claude-3.7-sonnet. Moreover, given the limited
availability of benchmarks that evaluate web agents' information aggregation
abilities, we construct a human-annotated evaluation split of WebAggregatorQA
as a challenging test set. On this benchmark, Claude-3.7-sonnet only achieves
28%, and GPT-4.1 scores 25.8%. Even when agents manage to retrieve all
references, they still struggle on WebAggregatorQA, highlighting the need to
strengthen the information aggregation capabilities of web agent foundations.

*Reid T. Johnson,Michelle D. Pain,Jordan D. West*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: NLT框架用自然语言输出替代LLM中的程序化JSON工具调用，通过解耦工具选择和响应生成来提高工具调用性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决程序化JSON工具调用中的任务干扰和格式约束问题，这些因素会降低工具调用性能

Method: 提出Natural Language Tools框架，将工具选择与响应生成分离，消除任务干扰和格式限制

Result: 在10个模型和6400次试验中，工具调用准确率提高18.4个百分点，输出方差降低70%，开源模型获益最大

Conclusion: NLT显著提升了工具调用性能，特别是在开源模型中，且改进在提示扰动下保持稳定，还能为缺乏原生支持的模型扩展工具调用能力

Abstract: We present Natural Language Tools (NLT), a framework that replaces
programmatic JSON tool calling in large language models (LLMs) with natural
language outputs. By decoupling tool selection from response generation, NLT
eliminates task interference and format constraints that degrade tool call
performance. When evaluated across 10 models and 6,400 trials spanning customer
service and mental health domains, NLT improves tool calling accuracy by 18.4
percentage points while reducing output variance by 70%. Open-weight models see
the largest gains, surpassing flagship closed-weight alternatives, with
implications for model training in both reinforcement learning and supervised
fine-tuning stages. These improvements persist under prompt perturbations and
extend tool-calling capabilities to models lacking native support.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LiRA框架通过锚定低资源语言到英语语义空间和语言感知推理头，在低资源条件下提升跨语言表示、检索和推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型在高资源语言性能饱和，但在低资源语言表现较差的问题，主要由于训练数据有限、机器翻译噪声和不稳定的跨语言对齐。

Method: 包含两个模块：Arca通过锚定对齐和多智能体协作编码将低资源语言锚定到英语语义空间；LaSR在Arca基础上添加语言感知轻量推理头，通过一致性正则化增强推理能力。

Result: 在跨语言检索、语义相似度和推理等低资源基准测试中，在少样本和噪声放大设置下均表现出持续增益和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: LiRA框架有效提升了低资源语言的跨语言表示能力，同时增强了检索和推理的鲁棒性，并发布了多语言产品检索数据集。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) rapidly advance, performance on high-resource
languages (e.g., English, Chinese) is nearing saturation, yet remains
substantially lower for low-resource languages (e.g., Urdu, Thai) due to
limited training data, machine-translation noise, and unstable cross-lingual
alignment. We introduce LiRA (Linguistic Robust Anchoring for Large Language
Models), a training framework that robustly improves cross-lingual
representations under low-resource conditions while jointly strengthening
retrieval and reasoning. LiRA comprises two modules: (i) Arca (Anchored
Representation Composition Architecture), which anchors low-resource languages
to an English semantic space via anchor-based alignment and multi-agent
collaborative encoding, preserving geometric stability in a shared embedding
space; and (ii) LaSR (Language-coupled Semantic Reasoner), which adds a
language-aware lightweight reasoning head with consistency regularization on
top of Arca's multilingual representations, unifying the training objective to
enhance cross-lingual understanding, retrieval, and reasoning robustness. We
further construct and release a multilingual product retrieval dataset covering
five Southeast Asian and two South Asian languages. Experiments across
low-resource benchmarks (cross-lingual retrieval, semantic similarity, and
reasoning) show consistent gains and robustness under few-shot and
noise-amplified settings; ablations validate the contribution of both Arca and
LaSR. Code will be released on GitHub and the dataset on Hugging Face.

*Matt Grenander,Shay B. Cohen,Mark Steedman*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种压缩表示方法，通过提取和重组实体级标记来提高seq2seq共指消解模型在增量设置中的效率，在保持性能的同时实现1.8的压缩比。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的seq2seq共指消解模型虽然性能优异，但在增量设置（如对话）中缺乏灵活性和效率，无法高效处理顺序输入的文本。

Method: 通过提取和重组实体级标记，并丢弃大部分其他输入标记，创建压缩表示来提高seq2seq模型在增量设置中的效率。

Result: 在OntoNotes上，最佳模型仅比全前缀增量基线低0.6 CoNLL F1点，同时实现1.8的压缩比；在LitBank上超越了最先进性能。

Conclusion: 在seq2seq共指消解器中丢弃大量标记是在增量共指消解中的可行策略，能够在保持性能的同时显著提高效率。

Abstract: Seq2seq coreference models have introduced a new paradigm for coreference
resolution by learning to generate text corresponding to coreference labels,
without requiring task-specific parameters. While these models achieve new
state-of-the-art performance, they do so at the cost of flexibility and
efficiency. In particular, they do not efficiently handle incremental settings
such as dialogue, where text must processed sequentially. We propose a
compressed representation in order to improve the efficiency of these methods
in incremental settings. Our method works by extracting and re-organizing
entity-level tokens, and discarding the majority of other input tokens. On
OntoNotes, our best model achieves just 0.6 CoNLL F1 points below a
full-prefix, incremental baseline while achieving a compression ratio of 1.8.
On LitBank, where singleton mentions are annotated, it passes state-of-the-art
performance. Our results indicate that discarding a wide portion of tokens in
seq2seq resolvers is a feasible strategy for incremental coreference
resolution.

*Kyubyung Chae,Gihoon Kim,Gyuseong Lee,Taesup Kim,Jaejin Lee,Heejin Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究构建了一个新的数据集和分析框架来评估主权LLMs的社会文化元素和技术稳健性，发现虽然主权LLMs在支持低资源语言方面有意义，但未必能很好地服务目标用户，且可能低估安全性等重要质量属性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏验证主权LLMs两个关键问题的框架和数据集：(1)模型与用户社会文化背景的契合度；(2)模型在保持安全性和技术稳健性同时不暴露用户于潜在风险的能力。

Method: 构建新数据集并引入分析框架，用于提取和评估主权LLMs的社会文化元素，同时评估其技术稳健性。

Result: 实验结果表明，主权LLMs在支持低资源语言方面发挥有意义作用，但并不总能很好地服务目标用户，追求未经测试的主张可能导致低估安全性等关键质量属性。

Conclusion: 推进主权LLMs需要更广泛的评估，纳入更全面、有根据且实用的标准。

Abstract: Recent trends in LLMs development clearly show growing interest in the use
and application of sovereign LLMs. The global debate over sovereign LLMs
highlights the need for governments to develop their LLMs, tailored to their
unique socio-cultural and historical contexts. However, there remains a
shortage of frameworks and datasets to verify two critical questions: (1) how
well these models align with users' socio-cultural backgrounds, and (2) whether
they maintain safety and technical robustness without exposing users to
potential harms and risks. To address this gap, we construct a new dataset and
introduce an analytic framework for extracting and evaluating the
socio-cultural elements of sovereign LLMs, alongside assessments of their
technical robustness. Our experimental results demonstrate that while sovereign
LLMs play a meaningful role in supporting low-resource languages, they do not
always meet the popular claim that these models serve their target users well.
We also show that pursuing this untested claim may lead to underestimating
critical quality attributes such as safety. Our study suggests that advancing
sovereign LLMs requires a more extensive evaluation that incorporates a broader
range of well-grounded and practical criteria.

TL;DR: 提出了WritingPreferenceBench数据集，发现当前RLHF方法主要学习检测客观错误而非主观质量偏好，生成式奖励模型通过显式推理链能达到81.8%准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前偏好学习方法在标准基准上表现良好，但当移除客观质量信号时性能显著下降，需要评估模型在主观质量偏好上的能力。

Method: 构建了1,800个人工标注的偏好对数据集，涵盖8种创意写作类型，响应在客观正确性、事实准确性和长度上匹配，比较了序列奖励模型、零-shot语言模型和生成式奖励模型的性能。

Result: 序列奖励模型准确率仅52.7%，零-shot语言模型53.9%，而生成式奖励模型达到81.8%；不同写作类型间模型方差很大，准确率从18.2%到81.8%，标准差平均10.1%。

Conclusion: 成功的偏好建模可能需要中间推理表示而非直接分类，当前RLHF方法主要学习检测客观错误而非捕捉主观质量偏好。

Abstract: Current preference learning methods achieve high accuracy on standard
benchmarks but exhibit significant performance degradation when objective
quality signals are removed. We introduce WritingPreferenceBench, a dataset of
1,800 human-annotated preference pairs (1,200 English, 600 Chinese) across 8
creative writing genres, where responses are matched for objective correctness,
factual accuracy, and length. On this benchmark, sequence-based reward
models--the standard architecture for RLHF--achieve only 52.7% mean accuracy,
while zero-shot language model judges perform at 53.9%. In contrast, generative
reward models that produce explicit reasoning chains achieve 81.8% accuracy. We
observe high within-model variance across genres: individual models range from
18.2% to 81.8% accuracy across different writing categories, with standard
deviations averaging 10.1%. This variance persists regardless of model scale,
with 27B parameter models showing no consistent improvement over 8B variants.
Our results suggest that current RLHF methods primarily learn to detect
objective errors rather than capture subjective quality preferences (e.g.,
creativity, stylistic flair, and emotional resonance), and that successful
preference modeling may require intermediate reasoning representations rather
than direct classification.

*Kedi Chen,Zhikai Lei,Xu Guo,Xuecheng Wu,Siyuan Zeng,Jianghao Yin,Yinqi Zhang,Qin Chen,Jie Zhou,Liang He,Qipeng Guo,Kai Chen,Wei Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文介绍了CodeSeq，一个基于数字序列的合成后训练数据集，用于提升大语言模型的归纳推理能力。通过将数字序列打包为算法问题来发现通用项，并采用反思失败测试用例和迭代修正的方法生成监督微调数据，结合基于可解性和自导向案例生成成功率的强化学习奖励机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有归纳推理研究面临两个挑战：一是现有归纳数据主要关注表面规律，缺乏复杂内部模式；二是当前工作仅简单提示LLMs或在简单提示-响应对上微调，未提供精确思维过程或实现难度控制。

Method: 提出CodeSeq数据集，将数字序列打包为算法问题来定义通用项生成任务。通过反思失败测试用例和迭代修正生成监督微调数据，教导LLMs学习自主案例生成和自我检查。同时利用强化学习，基于可解性（从问题通过率估计）和自导向案例生成成功率的案例协同可解性缩放奖励。

Result: 实验结果表明，使用CodeSeq训练的模型在各种推理任务上表现提升，并能保持模型的分布外性能。

Conclusion: CodeSeq通过合成数据生成和强化学习的结合，有效提升了LLMs的归纳推理能力，同时保持了良好的泛化性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) make remarkable progress in reasoning tasks.
Among different reasoning modes, inductive reasoning, due to its better
alignment with human learning, attracts increasing interest. However, research
on inductive reasoning faces certain challenges. First, existing inductive data
mostly focuses on superficial regularities while lacking more complex internal
patterns. Second, current works merely prompt LLMs or finetune on simple
prompt-response pairs, but do not provide precise thinking processes nor
implement difficulty control. Unlike previous work, we address these challenges
by introducing \textit{CodeSeq}, a synthetic post-training dataset built from
number sequences. We package number sequences into algorithmic problems to
discover their general terms, defining a general term generation (GTG) task
correspondingly. Our pipeline generates supervised finetuning data by
reflecting on failed test cases and incorporating iterative corrections,
thereby teaching LLMs to learn autonomous case generation and self-checking.
Additionally, it leverages reinforcement learning with a novel Case-Synergy
Solvability Scaling Reward based on both solvability, estimated from the
problem pass rate, and the success rate of self-directed case generation,
enabling models to learn more effectively from both successes and failures.
Experimental results show that the models trained with \textit{CodeSeq} improve
on various reasoning tasks and can preserve the models' OOD performance.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出RLAIF-SPA框架，通过强化学习结合ASR和LLM技术来优化情感语音合成的表达性和清晰度，在Libri Speech数据集上显著优于Chat-TTS。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前TTS合成在情感表达方面仍面临挑战，现有方法依赖昂贵的情感标注或使用间接优化目标，导致生成的语音情感平淡。

Method: 采用RLAIF机制，结合ASR和LLM分别评估语义准确性和韵律-情感标签对齐，作为情感表达性和清晰度的直接奖励。通过韵律标签对齐在结构、情感、速度和音调四个维度增强表达质量。

Result: 在Libri Speech数据集上，RLAIF-SPA相比Chat-TTS实现WER降低26.1%、SIM-O提升9.1%，人工评估提升超过10%。

Conclusion: RLAIF-SPA框架有效提升了情感语音合成的表达性和清晰度，为情感TTS提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Text-To-Speech synthesis has achieved near-human quality in neutral speech,
but emotional expressiveness remains a challenge. Existing methods often rely
on costly emotion annotations or optimize indirect objectives that fail to
capture the emotional expressiveness and perceptual naturalness of speech,
leading to generated speech that is accurate but emotionally flat. To address
these challenges, we propose the RLAIF-SPA framework, incorporating a
Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback (RLAIF) mechanism to employ Automatic
Speech Recognition (ASR) and Large Language Model (LLM) techniques to
respectively judge semantic accuracy and prosodic-emotional label alignment as
a direct reward for emotional expressiveness and intelligibility optimization.
Specifically, it leverages Prosodic Label Alignment to enhance expressive
quality by jointly considering semantic accuracy and prosodic-emotional
alignment along four fine-grained dimensions: Structure, Emotion, Speed, and
Tone. In addition, it incorporates Semantic Accuracy Feedback to ensure the
generation of clear and accurate speech. Experiments on the Libri Speech
dataset show that RLAIF-SPA outperforms Chat-TTS, with a 26.1% reduction in
WER, a 9.1% increase in SIM-O, and over 10% improvement in human evaluation.

*Xinyue Ma,Pol Pastells,Mireia Farrús,Mariona Taulé*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种方法，通过创建包含中文"被"字被动句的数据集来教导机器翻译模型理解语义韵律，特别是"被"字句的负面语义韵律。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语义韵律是通过语言单位与一系列固定搭配共同出现形成的搭配意义，与语义意义不同。由于直译的词语可能具有不同的语义韵律，需要更多关注这一语言特性以生成准确翻译，但当前的机器翻译模型无法处理这一问题。

Method: 创建英文-中文句子对数据集，展示"被"字被动句的负面语义韵律，然后使用该数据集对OPUS-MT、NLLB-600M和mBART50模型进行微调，用于英中翻译任务。

Result: 微调后的机器翻译模型在翻译不利内容时能更好地使用"被"字被动句，并在翻译中性和有利内容时避免使用。此外，在多语言模型NLLB-600M中，这种语义韵律知识可以从英中翻译迁移到其他语言对（如西班牙语-中文）。

Conclusion: 通过专门的数据集微调可以有效教导机器翻译模型理解特定结构的语义韵律，提升翻译准确性，且这种知识在多语言模型中具有可迁移性。

Abstract: Semantic prosody is a collocational meaning formed through the co-occurrence
of a linguistic unit and a consistent series of collocates, which should be
treated separately from semantic meaning. Since words that are literal
translations of each other may have different semantic prosody, more attention
should be paid to this linguistic property to generate accurate translations.
However, current machine translation models cannot handle this problem. To
bridge the gap, we propose an approach to teach machine translation models
about semantic prosody of a specific structure. We focus on Chinese BEI
passives and create a dataset of English-Chinese sentence pairs with the
purpose of demonstrating the negative semantic prosody of BEI passives. Then we
fine-tune OPUS-MT, NLLB-600M and mBART50 models with our dataset for the
English-Chinese translation task. Our results show that fine-tuned MT models
perform better on using BEI passives for translating unfavourable content and
avoid using it for neutral and favourable content. Also, in NLLB-600M, which is
a multilingual model, this knowledge of semantic prosody can be transferred
from English-Chinese translation to other language pairs, such as
Spanish-Chinese.

TL;DR: 提出了一种以人为中心的框架，通过生成用户故事和促进多智能体讨论，帮助在AI医疗工具部署前识别潜在益处和危害。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI在医疗领域的快速发展带来了偏见、隐私侵犯和不平等访问等风险，现有自动风险检测方法减少了人类对危害产生机制的理解参与。

Method: 开发了一个人类中心框架，通过生成用户故事和支持多智能体讨论，帮助人们在部署前创造性思考AI的潜在影响。

Result: 用户研究发现，阅读故事的参与者识别了更广泛的危害类型，响应分布更均匀；而未阅读故事者主要关注隐私和健康（58.3%）。

Conclusion: 故事叙述帮助参与者推测更广泛的危害和益处，并更创造性地思考AI对用户的影响。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly transforming healthcare, enabling
fast development of tools like stress monitors, wellness trackers, and mental
health chatbots. However, rapid and low-barrier development can introduce risks
of bias, privacy violations, and unequal access, especially when systems ignore
real-world contexts and diverse user needs. Many recent methods use AI to
detect risks automatically, but this can reduce human engagement in
understanding how harms arise and who they affect. We present a human-centered
framework that generates user stories and supports multi-agent discussions to
help people think creatively about potential benefits and harms before
deployment. In a user study, participants who read stories recognized a broader
range of harms, distributing their responses more evenly across all 13 harm
types. In contrast, those who did not read stories focused primarily on privacy
and well-being (58.3%). Our findings show that storytelling helped participants
speculate about a broader range of harms and benefits and think more creatively
about AI's impact on users.

TL;DR: AutoRubric-R1V是一个结合强化学习与过程监督的框架，通过自动收集基于评分标准的生成奖励来解决多模态大语言模型中仅奖励最终答案正确性导致的虚假推理问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型从感知任务发展到复杂多步推理，但仅基于最终答案正确性的强化学习奖励会导致虚假推理，需要过程级监督来改进推理质量。

Method: 提出可扩展的自聚合方法，从成功轨迹中提取一致的推理检查点，无需人工标注或更强的教师模型即可构建问题特定的评分标准，结合基于评分标准和结果的奖励。

Result: 在六个多模态推理基准测试中达到最先进性能，并在专门的评估中显著提高推理的忠实度。

Conclusion: AutoRubric-R1V通过自动生成的过程级监督有效提升了多模态推理模型的性能和推理忠实度。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have rapidly advanced from
perception tasks to complex multi-step reasoning, yet reinforcement learning
with verifiable rewards (RLVR) often leads to spurious reasoning since only the
final-answer correctness is rewarded. To address this limitation, we propose
AutoRubric-R1V, a framework that integrates RLVR with process-level supervision
through automatically collected rubric-based generative rewards. Our key
innovation lies in a scalable self-aggregation method that distills consistent
reasoning checkpoints from successful trajectories, enabling problem-specific
rubric construction without human annotation or stronger teacher models. By
jointly leveraging rubric-based and outcome rewards, AutoRubric-R1V achieves
state-of-the-art performance on six multimodal reasoning benchmarks and
substantially improves reasoning faithfulness in dedicated evaluations.

TL;DR: Pluto是一个用于评估LLM生成Verilog代码效率的基准测试框架，包含114个问题、自检测试平台和帕累托最优参考实现。实验显示LLM在功能正确性上可达78.3%，但在面积、延迟和功率效率方面仅达63-66%，远低于专家实现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试主要关注功能正确性，但硬件设计还需要优化面积、延迟和功率等综合指标。现有基准缺乏优化基线和验证测试平台，无法全面评估LLM生成的硬件设计效率。

Method: 开发Pluto基准测试框架，包含114个设计问题，配备自检测试平台和多个帕累托最优参考实现，用于全面评估LLM生成的Verilog代码在功能正确性和综合效率方面的表现。

Result: 实验结果表明，最先进的LLM在功能正确性上达到78.3%（pass@1），但在综合效率方面表现较差：面积效率63.8%、延迟效率65.9%、功率效率64.0%（eff@1），明显落后于专家手工实现。

Conclusion: 需要像Pluto这样的效率感知评估框架来推动硬件导向的LLM研究发展，当前LLM在硬件设计效率方面仍有很大提升空间。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used to automate hardware
design tasks, including the generation of Verilog code. While early benchmarks
focus primarily on functional correctness, efficient hardware design demands
additional optimization for synthesis metrics such as area, delay, and power.
Existing benchmarks fall short in evaluating these aspects comprehensively:
they often lack optimized baselines or testbenches for verification. To address
these gaps, we present Pluto, a benchmark and evaluation framework designed to
assess the efficiency of LLM-generated Verilog designs. Pluto presents a
comprehensive evaluation set of 114 problems with self-checking testbenches and
multiple Pareto-optimal reference implementations. Experimental results show
that state-of-the-art LLMs can achieve high functional correctness, reaching
78.3\% at pass@1, but their synthesis efficiency still lags behind
expert-crafted implementations, with area efficiency of 63.8\%, delay
efficiency of 65.9\%, and power efficiency of 64.0\% at eff@1. This highlights
the need for efficiency-aware evaluation frameworks such as Pluto to drive
progress in hardware-focused LLM research.

TL;DR: COIG-Writer是一个中文创意写作数据集，包含1,665个精心策划的三元组，涵盖51种文体，每个三元组包含逆向工程提示、详细创作推理过程和最终文本。研究发现创意写作需要叙事逻辑（过程监督）和语言表达（通用数据）两个组件，揭示了过程监督的有效性、文化界限性和词汇多样性与创意质量的反比关系。

Motivation: 解决大语言模型在创意写作中的系统性缺陷，特别是在非英语语境中训练数据稀缺且缺乏过程级监督的问题。

Method: 通过系统逆向工程高质量文本构建COIG-Writer数据集，包含逆向工程提示、详细创作推理和最终文本的三元组结构。

Result: 发现过程监督高度有效但需要通用数据稳定（至少1:12比例）；创意能力具有文化界限性（中英文性能差距89.26%）；词汇多样性与创意质量呈反比关系（TTR悖论）。

Conclusion: 创意卓越源于逻辑脚手架和语言基础的相互作用，类似于数学推理增强但不能替代基础模型中的语言能力。

Abstract: Large language models exhibit systematic deficiencies in creative writing,
particularly in non-English contexts where training data is scarce and lacks
process-level supervision. We present COIG-Writer, a novel Chinese creative
writing dataset that captures both diverse outputs and their underlying thought
processes through systematic reverse-engineering of high-quality texts. Unlike
existing datasets that provide only input-output pairs, COIG-Writer comprises
1,665 meticulously curated triplets spanning 51 genres, each containing: (1) a
reverse-engineered prompt, (2) detailed creative reasoning documenting
decision-making processes, and (3) the final text. Through comprehensive
experiments, we identify a two-component model of creative writing: narrative
logic (provided by process supervision) and linguistic expression (maintained
by general-purpose data). Our findings reveal three critical insights: (1)
Process supervision is highly effective but requires stabilization with general
data. A ratio of at least one creative sample to twelve general samples is
needed to achieve optimal performance; below this threshold, the win rate
progressively degrades (from 62.75% down to 35.78%)., (2) creative capabilities
are culturally-bound with no cross-lingual transfer (89.26pp gap between
Chinese and English performance), and (3) lexical diversity inversely
correlates with creative quality (TTR paradox), suggesting high diversity
signals compensatory behavior for logical deficiencies. These findings
establish that creative excellence emerges from the interaction between logical
scaffolding and linguistic grounding, analogous to how mathematical reasoning
enhances but cannot replace linguistic competence in foundation models.

Motivation: 发现推理模型的性能和答案分布对答案提取算法高度敏感，需要更可靠的评估方法。

Method: 答案再生框架：在原始输入输出前添加"Answer:"提示，通过额外模型推理重新生成答案，然后从中提取最终答案。

Abstract: Evaluating generative models, such as large language models (LLMs), commonly
involves question-answering tasks where the final answer is selected based on
probability of answer choices. On the other hand, for models requiring
reasoning, the method of answer extraction plays a critical role. Our research
reveals that the performance of reasoning models and their final answer
distributions are highly sensitive to the answer extraction algorithm employed.
In order to mitigate this, we propose a basic framework: Answer Regeneration.
The method uses an additional model inference, providing the prior input and
output prefaced by the prompt "Answer:". The final answer is then selected or
extracted from the regenerated output. We show that this
extraction-rule-agnostic approach exhibits improved performance and enhanced
robustness. Furthermore, we have applied this framework to general math
problems and open-ended question answering tasks. Our analysis and this
framework could offer a more reliable results for model evaluation.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了多模态生成模型在方言文本输入下的表现，发现当前模型在方言输入时性能下降32.26%-48.17%，并提出了一种编码器缓解策略来提升方言性能同时保持标准英语表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究多模态生成模型是否能有效处理方言文本输入，因为方言使用者在与生成模型交互时经常使用方言，但现有模型主要针对标准英语训练。

Method: 构建包含6种常见英语方言的大规模基准数据集，收集4200多个经过验证的提示，评估17个图像和视频生成模型。提出基于编码器的缓解策略，让模型学习识别新方言特征同时保持标准英语性能。

Result: 当前最先进多模态生成模型在方言输入时性能下降32.26%-48.17%。微调和提示重写等常见缓解方法只能小幅提升方言性能(<7%)，但可能显著降低标准英语性能。作者的方法能在Stable Diffusion 1.5等模型上将5种方言性能提升至与标准英语相当(+34.4%)，同时对标准英语性能影响极小。

Conclusion: 多模态生成模型在处理方言输入时存在显著性能下降，需要专门设计的方法来同时提升方言性能和保持标准英语表现。作者提出的编码器缓解策略是有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Contact languages like English exhibit rich regional variations in the form
of dialects, which are often used by dialect speakers interacting with
generative models. However, can multimodal generative models effectively
produce content given dialectal textual input? In this work, we study this
question by constructing a new large-scale benchmark spanning six common
English dialects. We work with dialect speakers to collect and verify over 4200
unique prompts and evaluate on 17 image and video generative models. Our
automatic and human evaluation results show that current state-of-the-art
multimodal generative models exhibit 32.26% to 48.17% performance degradation
when a single dialect word is used in the prompt. Common mitigation methods
such as fine-tuning and prompt rewriting can only improve dialect performance
by small margins (< 7%), while potentially incurring significant performance
degradation in Standard American English (SAE). To this end, we design a
general encoder-based mitigation strategy for multimodal generative models. Our
method teaches the model to recognize new dialect features while preserving SAE
performance. Experiments on models such as Stable Diffusion 1.5 show that our
method is able to simultaneously raise performance on five dialects to be on
par with SAE (+34.4%), while incurring near zero cost to SAE performance.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需外部数据的在线测试时框架，通过自监督优化MoE模型的路由决策，在文本生成过程中持续改进专家选择。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MoE模型在部署中由于分布偏移导致路由决策不佳，现有测试时适应方法主要针对密集模型且需要外部数据，限制了在MoE架构中的实用性。

Method: 采用两阶段循环方法：预填充阶段和定期间隔时，基于已生成序列通过自监督优化路由决策；正常生成文本时保持修改后的路由器。通过轻量级加性向量仅更新选定层的路由器logits。

Result: 在挑战性推理任务上获得一致性能提升，如OLMoE在HumanEval上提升5.5%；与自一致性等技术结合时，在DeepSeek-V2-Lite上平均提升6%。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了MoE模型的路由优化问题，具有即插即用特性，能与其他测试时扩展技术自然互补，同时保持计算效率和上下文偏移的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models achieve efficient scaling through sparse
expert activation, but often suffer from suboptimal routing decisions due to
distribution shifts in deployment. While existing test-time adaptation methods
could potentially address these issues, they primarily focus on dense models
and require access to external data, limiting their practical applicability to
MoE architectures. However, we find that, instead of relying on reference data,
we can optimize MoE expert selection on-the-fly based only on input context. As
such, we propose \textit{a data-free, online test-time framework} that
continuously adapts MoE routing decisions during text generation without
external supervision or data. Our method cycles between two phases: During the
prefill stage, and later in regular intervals, we optimize the routing
decisions of the model using self-supervision based on the already generated
sequence. Then, we generate text as normal, maintaining the modified router
until the next adaption. We implement this through lightweight additive vectors
that only update router logits in selected layers, maintaining computational
efficiency while preventing over-adaptation. The experimental results show
consistent performance gains on challenging reasoning tasks while maintaining
robustness to context shifts. For example, our method achieves a 5.5\%
improvement on HumanEval with OLMoE. Furthermore, owing to its plug-and-play
property, our method naturally complements existing test-time scaling
techniques, e.g., achieving 6\% average gains when incorporated with
self-consistency on DeepSeek-V2-Lite.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文首次系统研究语言模型训练中的"中期训练"阶段，发现其在数学和代码领域效果最佳，能有效减少预训练与后训练数据之间的语法差距，相比持续预训练表现更好且减少遗忘。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管中期训练（在预训练末期混入高质量指令数据）在实践中很流行，但对其有效性的科学理解很少，本文旨在系统研究这一训练阶段的作用机制。

Method: 通过从头预训练语言模型并在不同领域监督微调数据集上进行受控实验，研究中期训练的效果，并以代码领域为例进行消融实验分析开始时间和混合权重的影响。

Result: 中期训练在数学和代码领域效果最显著，能更好减少预训练与后训练数据间的语法差距；早期引入专业数据比混合权重影响更大，能在领域内获得更好表现并更好保持通用语言建模能力。

Conclusion: 中期训练是一种领域适应技术，相比持续预训练，通过减少遗忘获得更好性能，特别是在语法差距较大的领域如数学和代码中效果最明显。

Abstract: Recently, many language models have been pretrained with a "midtraining"
phase, in which higher quality, often instruction-formatted data, is mixed in
at the end of pretraining. Despite the popularity of this practice, there is
little scientific understanding of this phase of model training or why it is
effective. In this work, we conduct the first systematic investigation of
midtraining through controlled experiments with language models pretrained from
scratch and fine-tuned on supervised finetuning datasets in different domains.
We find that when compared after supervised fine-tuning, the effectiveness of
midtraining is highest in the math and code domains, where midtraining can best
reduce the syntactic gap between pretraining and posttraining data. In these
cases, midtraining consistently outperforms continued pretraining in both
in-domain validation loss as well as pretraining data forgetting after
posttraining. We conduct ablations on the starting time of the midtraining
phase and mixture weights of the midtraining data, using code midtraining as a
case study, and find that timing has a greater impact than mixture weights,
with earlier introduction of specialized data, yielding greater benefits
in-domain as well as preserving general language modeling better. These
findings establish midtraining as a domain adaptation technique that compared
to continued pretraining yields better performance through reduced forgetting.

TL;DR: MLIR-AIR是一个基于MLIR构建的新型编译器堆栈，专门针对AMD NPU等细粒度空间架构，通过AIR方言提供异步和层次化操作的结构化表示，实现空间调度、计算分布和通信计算重叠。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通用编译器在抽象并行性、局部性和同步时限制了在现代空间架构上的效率，需要显式机制来协调计算和数据以充分利用这些架构。

Method: 基于MLIR构建MLIR-AIR编译器堆栈，定义AIR方言提供异步和层次化操作的结构化表示，支持空间调度、计算分布和通信计算重叠。

Result: 在矩阵乘法中达到78.7%的计算效率，性能接近手工优化的MLIR-AIE实现；在多头注意力中仅用约150行代码实现融合实现。

Conclusion: MLIR-AIR能够将高级结构化控制流转换为有效利用NPU计算结构和内存层次的空间程序，通过编译器管理的调度实现异步执行、分块和通信重叠。

Abstract: General-purpose compilers abstract away parallelism, locality, and
synchronization, limiting their effectiveness on modern spatial architectures.
As modern computing architectures increasingly rely on fine-grained control
over data movement, execution order, and compute placement for performance,
compiler infrastructure must provide explicit mechanisms for orchestrating
compute and data to fully exploit such architectures. We introduce MLIR-AIR, a
novel, open-source compiler stack built on MLIR that bridges the semantic gap
between high-level workloads and fine-grained spatial architectures such as
AMD's NPUs. MLIR-AIR defines the AIR dialect, which provides structured
representations for asynchronous and hierarchical operations across compute and
memory resources. AIR primitives allow the compiler to orchestrate spatial
scheduling, distribute computation across hardware regions, and overlap
communication with computation without relying on ad hoc runtime coordination
or manual scheduling. We demonstrate MLIR-AIR's capabilities through two case
studies: matrix multiplication and the multi-head attention block from the
LLaMA 2 model. For matrix multiplication, MLIR-AIR achieves up to 78.7% compute
efficiency and generates implementations with performance almost identical to
state-of-the-art, hand-optimized matrix multiplication written using the
lower-level, close-to-metal MLIR-AIE framework. For multi-head attention, we
demonstrate that the AIR interface supports fused implementations using
approximately 150 lines of code, enabling tractable expression of complex
workloads with efficient mapping to spatial hardware. MLIR-AIR transforms
high-level structured control flow into spatial programs that efficiently
utilize the compute fabric and memory hierarchy of an NPU, leveraging
asynchronous execution, tiling, and communication overlap through
compiler-managed scheduling.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合系统化合成数据生成、三元组损失和改进嵌入、以及新颖的逐层模型融合方法，显著提高了RAG系统中LLM输出的一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM在语义等价输入下生成不一致输出的问题，以及缺乏一致性训练数据和现有微调技术在提升输出一致性方面的局限性。

Method: 使用系统化合成数据生成、三元组损失优化嵌入表示，以及基于中间层激活的一致性感知权重的逐层模型融合方法。

Result: 融合模型显著提升了输出一致性，在响应相似性方面比基线提高了约47.5%。

Conclusion: 该方法为提升工业RAG系统的可靠性提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems leverage Large Language Models
(LLMs) to generate accurate and reliable responses that are grounded in
retrieved context. However, LLMs often generate inconsistent outputs for
semantically equivalent inputs, a problem compounded by the scarcity of
consistency-focused training data and the limitations of current fine-tuning
techniques in enhancing output consistency. We propose a new approach combining
systematic synthetic data generation, triplet loss for better embeddings, and a
novel layer-wise model merging approach. Using consistency-aware weights
derived from intermediate layer activations, our method effectively integrates
knowledge from specialized models. Experimental results how that our merged
model significantly enhances output consistency, achieving a ~47.5\%
improvement in response similarity over the baseline, thus offering a practical
solution for increasing the reliability of an industrial RAG system.

Motivation: 传统的扩展定律无法捕捉下游任务性能，其中上下文起着关键作用，需要一个新的框架来联合建模训练计算和上下文对下游性能的影响。

Method: 提出了一个简单可解释的框架，通过在Llama-2-7B和Llama-2-13B的扩展上下文变体上，在65,500个实例上拟合三个任务（算术推理、常识推理和机器翻译）的观察下游性能来验证。

Result: 框架准确建模了分布内下游性能，在三个数量级的训练计算上泛化良好，并能可靠地外推上下文增加时的性能。

Conclusion: 这些发现为训练计算和上下文利用之间的相互作用提供了有价值的见解，为设计更高效的长上下文LLM提供了指导。

Abstract: Scaling laws have transformed our understanding of large language models by
linking upstream metrics like cross-entropy loss to design factors such as
model size, training data, and compute. However, these conventional laws fail
to capture downstream task performance, where context plays a critical role. In
this work, we propose a straightforward, interpretable framework that jointly
models downstream performance as a function of the training compute and the
provided context. We empirically validate our framework by fitting it on the
observed downstream performance of extended-context variants of Llama-2-7B and
Llama-2-13B across 65,500 unique instances spanning three tasks: arithmetic
reasoning, common sense reasoning, and machine translation. Our results
demonstrate that our framework accurately models in-distribution downstream
performance, generalizes across three orders of magnitude in training compute,
and reliably extrapolates performance as the amount of context increases. These
findings offer valuable insights into the interplay between training compute
and context utilization, providing guidance for designing more efficient
long-context LLMs for diverse downstream tasks. Our code is available at

Motivation: 心理健康障碍是全球致残的主要原因，但在初级保健环境中，抑郁症和焦虑症的误诊率超过60%，迫切需要可扩展、易获取且情境感知的诊断工具来支持早期检测和干预。

Method: 使用GPT-4.1 Mini和MetaLLaMA进行零样本提示，以及使用低秩适应(LoRA)微调的RoBERTa模型，在553个真实世界半结构化访谈数据集上进行基准测试。

Result: 模型在各类诊断中达到超过80%的准确率，PTSD检测表现尤为突出（准确率89%，召回率98%）。使用较短、聚焦的上下文片段能提高召回率，LoRA微调在低秩配置下保持竞争力。

Conclusion: 基于LLM的模型相比传统自报告筛查工具有显著改进，为在资源匮乏或高污名化环境中整合机器学习到临床工作流程奠定了基础，提供了低门槛AI驱动早期诊断的路径。

Abstract: Mental health disorders remain among the leading cause of disability
worldwide, yet conditions such as depression, anxiety, and Post-Traumatic
Stress Disorder (PTSD) are frequently underdiagnosed or misdiagnosed due to
subjective assessments, limited clinical resources, and stigma and low
awareness. In primary care settings, studies show that providers misidentify
depression or anxiety in over 60% of cases, highlighting the urgent need for
scalable, accessible, and context-aware diagnostic tools that can support early
detection and intervention. In this study, we evaluate the effectiveness of
machine learning models for mental health screening using a unique dataset of
553 real-world, semistructured interviews, each paried with ground-truth
diagnoses for major depressive episodes (MDE), anxiety disorders, and PTSD. We
benchmark multiple model classes, including zero-shot prompting with GPT-4.1
Mini and MetaLLaMA, as well as fine-tuned RoBERTa models using LowRank
Adaptation (LoRA). Our models achieve over 80% accuracy across diagnostic
categories, with especially strongperformance on PTSD (up to 89% accuracy and
98% recall). We also find that using shorter context, focused context segments
improves recall, suggesting that focused narrative cues enhance detection
sensitivity. LoRA fine-tuning proves both efficient and effective, with
lower-rank configurations (e.g., rank 8 and 16) maintaining competitive
performance across evaluation metrics. Our results demonstrate that LLM-based
models can offer substantial improvements over traditional self-report
screening tools, providing a path toward low-barrier, AI-powerd early
diagnosis. This work lays the groundwork for integrating machine learning into
real-world clinical workflows, particularly in low-resource or high-stigma
environments where access to timely mental health care is most limited.

Result: 实验表明该方法不仅提升了模型的推理性能，还赋予了显著的自奖励能力，增强了推理时的扩展性能

Conclusion: LaSeR算法通过最小化额外计算成本（仅需一个额外token推理）实现了高效的推理和自奖励联合优化

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has recently emerged as
a core paradigm for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language
Models (LLMs). To address the lack of verification signals at test time, prior
studies incorporate the training of model's self-verification capability into
the standard RLVR process, thereby unifying reasoning and verification
capabilities within a single LLM. However, previous practice requires the LLM
to sequentially generate solutions and self-verifications using two separate
prompt templates, which significantly reduces efficiency. In this work, we
theoretically reveal that the closed-form solution to the RL objective of
self-verification can be reduced to a remarkably simple form: the true
reasoning reward of a solution is equal to its last-token self-rewarding score,
which is computed as the difference between the policy model's next-token
log-probability assigned to any pre-specified token at the solution's last
token and a pre-calculated constant, scaled by the KL coefficient. Based on
this insight, we propose LaSeR (Reinforcement Learning with Last-Token
Self-Rewarding), an algorithm that simply augments the original RLVR loss with
a MSE loss that aligns the last-token self-rewarding scores with verifier-based
reasoning rewards, jointly optimizing the reasoning and self-rewarding
capabilities of LLMs. The optimized self-rewarding scores can be utilized in
both training and testing to enhance model performance. Notably, our algorithm
derives these scores from the predicted next-token probability distribution of
the last token immediately after generation, incurring only the minimal extra
cost of one additional token inference. Experiments show that our method not
only improves the model's reasoning performance but also equips it with
remarkable self-rewarding capability, thereby boosting its inference-time
scaling performance.

Metabolomics presents unique challenges with its complex biochemical pathways,

research: knowledge, understanding, grounding, reasoning, and research. Our
evaluation of 25 open- and closed-source LLMs reveals distinct performance
patterns across metabolomics tasks: while models perform well on text

Conclusion: IGPO通过信息增益提供密集内在监督，有效解决多轮代理训练中的奖励稀疏问题，提升学习效果

Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-based agents are increasingly trained with
reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance their ability to interact with external
environments through tool use, particularly in search-based settings that
require multi-turn reasoning and knowledge acquisition. However, existing
approaches typically rely on outcome-based rewards that are only provided at
the final answer. This reward sparsity becomes particularly problematic in
multi-turn settings, where long trajectories exacerbate two critical issues:
(i) advantage collapse, where all rollouts receive identical rewards and
provide no useful learning signals, and (ii) lack of fine-grained credit
assignment, where dependencies between turns are obscured, especially in
long-horizon tasks. In this paper, we propose Information Gain-based Policy
Optimization (IGPO), a simple yet effective RL framework that provides dense
and intrinsic supervision for multi-turn agent training. IGPO models each
interaction turn as an incremental process of acquiring information about the
ground truth, and defines turn-level rewards as the marginal increase in the
policy's probability of producing the correct answer. Unlike prior
process-level reward approaches that depend on external reward models or costly
Monte Carlo estimation, IGPO derives intrinsic rewards directly from the
model's own belief updates. These intrinsic turn-level rewards are combined
with outcome-level supervision to form dense reward trajectories. Extensive
experiments on both in-domain and out-of-domain benchmarks demonstrate that
IGPO consistently outperforms strong baselines in multi-turn scenarios,
achieving higher accuracy and improved sample efficiency.

Abstract: Digital agents require diverse, large-scale UI trajectories to generalize
across real-world tasks, yet collecting such data is prohibitively expensive in
both human annotation, infra and engineering perspectives. To this end, we
introduce $\textbf{UI-Simulator}$, a scalable paradigm that generates
structured UI states and transitions to synthesize training trajectories at
scale. Our paradigm integrates a digital world simulator for diverse UI states,
a guided rollout process for coherent exploration, and a trajectory wrapper
that produces high-quality and diverse trajectories for agent training. We
further propose $\textbf{UI-Simulator-Grow}$, a targeted scaling strategy that
enables more rapid and data-efficient scaling by prioritizing high-impact tasks
and synthesizes informative trajectory variants. Experiments on WebArena and
AndroidWorld show that UI-Simulator rivals or surpasses open-source agents
trained on real UIs with significantly better robustness, despite using weaker
teacher models. Moreover, UI-Simulator-Grow matches the performance of
Llama-3-70B-Instruct using only Llama-3-8B-Instruct as the base model,
highlighting the potential of targeted synthesis scaling paradigm to

TL;DR: 提出Elastic-Cache方法，通过自适应地选择性刷新KV缓存来加速扩散大语言模型的解码过程，减少冗余计算，同时保持生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在每个去噪步骤和所有层都重新计算所有token的QKV，但KV状态在大多数步骤中变化很小，特别是在浅层，导致大量冗余计算。

Method: 基于三个观察：(1) 远处的MASK token可作为长度偏置进行块状缓存；(2) KV动态性随深度增加，从深层开始选择性刷新即可；(3) 最受关注token的KV漂移最小。提出训练无关、架构无关的Elastic-Cache策略，联合决定何时刷新（通过最受关注token的注意力感知漂移测试）和在哪里刷新（通过深度感知调度）。

Result: 在数学推理和代码生成任务上实现显著加速：GSM8K上8.7倍，长序列上45.1倍，HumanEval上4.8倍，同时保持比基线更高的准确率。吞吐量比现有基于置信度的方法高6.8倍。

Conclusion: Elastic-Cache通过自适应、层感知的缓存更新，有效减少冗余计算，加速扩散LLM的解码，在保持生成质量的同时实现显著性能提升，使扩散LLM的实际部署成为可能。

Abstract: This work studies how to adaptively recompute key-value (KV) caches for
diffusion large language models (DLMs) to maximize prediction accuracy while
minimizing decoding latency. Prior methods' decoders recompute QKV for all
tokens at every denoising step and layer, despite KV states changing little
across most steps, especially in shallow layers, leading to substantial
redundancy. We make three observations: (1) distant ${\bf MASK}$ tokens
primarily act as a length-bias and can be cached block-wise beyond the active
prediction window; (2) KV dynamics increase with depth, suggesting that
selective refresh starting from deeper layers is sufficient; and (3) the
most-attended token exhibits the smallest KV drift, providing a conservative
lower bound on cache change for other tokens. Building on these, we propose
${\bf Elastic-Cache}$, a training-free, architecture-agnostic strategy that
jointly decides ${when}$ to refresh (via an attention-aware drift test on the
most-attended token) and ${where}$ to refresh (via a depth-aware schedule that
recomputes from a chosen layer onward while reusing shallow-layer caches and
off-window MASK caches). Unlike fixed-period schemes, Elastic-Cache performs
adaptive, layer-aware cache updates for diffusion LLMs, reducing redundant
computation and accelerating decoding with negligible loss in generation
quality. Experiments on LLaDA-Instruct, LLaDA-1.5, and LLaDA-V across
mathematical reasoning and code generation tasks demonstrate consistent
speedups: $8.7\times$ on GSM8K (256 tokens), $45.1\times$ on longer sequences,
and $4.8\times$ on HumanEval, while consistently maintaining higher accuracy
than the baseline. Our method achieves significantly higher throughput
($6.8\times$ on GSM8K) than existing confidence-based approaches while
preserving generation quality, enabling practical deployment of diffusion LLMs.

Method: 使用预训练的动作中心运动相位自编码器建立潜在运动频率域，通过SPDM和TPDM在扩散过程中逐步融入语义指导和相邻运动片段的相位细节。

Result: 实验结果表明该框架在生成语义对齐的复合运动序列方面具有竞争力，同时保持了前后运动片段之间的相位过渡连续性。

Conclusion: 该框架不仅能生成高质量的复合运动序列，还能通过固定输入运动序列的相位参数实现运动插值任务，展示了扩展到各种应用场景的潜力。

Abstract: Recent research on motion generation has shown significant progress in
generating semantically aligned motion with singular semantics. However, when
employing these models to create composite sequences containing multiple
semantically generated motion clips, they often struggle to preserve the
continuity of motion dynamics at the transition boundaries between clips,
resulting in awkward transitions and abrupt artifacts. To address these
challenges, we present Compositional Phase Diffusion, which leverages the
Semantic Phase Diffusion Module (SPDM) and Transitional Phase Diffusion Module
(TPDM) to progressively incorporate semantic guidance and phase details from
adjacent motion clips into the diffusion process. Specifically, SPDM and TPDM
operate within the latent motion frequency domain established by the
pre-trained Action-Centric Motion Phase Autoencoder (ACT-PAE). This allows them
to learn semantically important and transition-aware phase information from
variable-length motion clips during training. Experimental results demonstrate
the competitive performance of our proposed framework in generating
compositional motion sequences that align semantically with the input
conditions, while preserving phase transitional continuity between preceding
and succeeding motion clips. Additionally, motion inbetweening task is made
possible by keeping the phase parameter of the input motion sequences fixed
throughout the diffusion process, showcasing the potential for extending the
proposed framework to accommodate various application scenarios. Codes are

*Vignesh V Menon,Adam Wieckowski,Yiquin Liu,Benjamin Bross,Detlev Marpe*

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: 本文提出基于CU分割策略的VVC多码率编码优化方法，通过单边界和双边界约束减少冗余计算，在保持视频质量的同时显著提升编码效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着超高清视频内容的普及，自适应流媒体需要多码率编码来适应不同网络条件。VVC虽然压缩效率高，但计算复杂度大，多码率编码成为资源密集型任务。

Method: 提出单边界和双边界方法，利用参考编码的CU深度约束来指导多个QP下的依赖编码，使用VVenC和不同预设进行评估。

Result: 编码时间最多减少11.69%，码率开销极小（<0.6%），帕累托前沿分析显示多码率方法优于现有配置。

Conclusion: CU引导策略在自适应流媒体中具有可扩展多码率编码的潜力，验证了该方法在保持质量的同时显著提升编码效率。

Abstract: The demand for efficient multi-rate encoding techniques has surged with the
increasing prevalence of ultra-high-definition (UHD) video content,
particularly in adaptive streaming scenarios where a single video must be
encoded at multiple bitrates to accommodate diverse network conditions. While
Versatile Video Coding (VVC) significantly improves compression efficiency, it
introduces considerable computational complexity, making multi-rate encoding a
resource-intensive task. This paper examines coding unit (CU) partitioning
strategies to minimize redundant computations in VVC while preserving high
video quality. We propose single- and double-bound approaches, leveraging CU
depth constraints from reference encodes to guide dependent encodes across
multiple QPs. These methods are evaluated using VVenC with various presets,
demonstrating consistent improvements in encoding efficiency. Our methods
achieve up to 11.69 % reduction in encoding time with minimal bitrate overhead
(<0.6 %). Comparative Pareto-front (PF) analysis highlights the superior
performance of multi-rate approaches over existing configurations. These
findings validate the potential of CU-guided strategies for scalable multi-rate
encoding in adaptive streaming.

### [229] [SHaRe-SSM: An Oscillatory Spiking Neural Network for Target Variable Modeling in Long Sequences](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14386)
*Kartikay Agrawal,Abhijeet Vikram,Vedant Sharma,Vaishnavi N.,Ayon Borthakur*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了SHaRe-SSM（尖峰谐波共振放电状态空间模型），这是一种用于超长序列建模的第二阶尖峰状态空间模型，在保持性能的同时显著降低了能耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受大模型和状态空间模型（SSMs）发展的启发，旨在设计一种适合超长序列建模且能量高效的尖峰神经网络模型，克服传统Transformer在长序列上的二次复杂度问题。

Method: 使用二阶尖峰SSM，采用并行扫描实现动态系统的稳定高效计算，并首次提出基于核的尖峰回归器，利用共振放电神经元处理超长序列。

Result: 在18k序列上比二阶ANN-based SSMs节省73倍能量，在50k序列上仍保持优越性能，平均表现优于Transformer和一阶SSMs。

Conclusion: SHaRe-SSM为资源受限应用提供了一种高效解决方案，在超长序列建模中实现了性能与能耗的良好平衡，并对共振放电SSM中的异质性、耗散和守恒进行了系统分析。

Abstract: In recent years, with the emergence of large models, there has been a
significant interest in spiking neural networks (SNNs) primarily due to their
energy efficiency, multiplication-free, and sparse event-based deep learning.
Similarly, state space models (SSMs) in varying designs have evolved as a
powerful alternative to transformers for target modeling in long sequences,
thereby overcoming the quadratic dependence on sequence length of a
transformer. Inspired by this progress, we here design SHaRe-SSM (Spiking
Harmonic Resonate and Fire State Space Model), for target variable modeling
(including both classification and regression) for very-long-range sequences.
Our second-order spiking SSM, on average, performs better than transformers or
first-order SSMs while circumventing multiplication operations, making it ideal
for resource-constrained applications. The proposed block consumes $73 \times$
less energy than second-order ANN-based SSMs for an 18k sequence, while
retaining performance. To ensure learnability over the long-range sequences, we
propose exploiting the stable and efficient implementation of the dynamical
system using parallel scans. Moreover, for the first time, we propose a
kernel-based spiking regressor using resonate and fire neurons for very
long-range sequences. Our network shows superior performance on even a 50k
sequence while being significantly energy-efficient. In addition, we conducted
a systematic analysis of the impact of heterogeneity, dissipation, and
conservation in resonate-and-fire SSMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为脑机接口和远程环境监测等应用提供低功耗、高可靠性的异常检测解决方案，需要在资源受限的传感器网络中实现严格的错误发现率控制。

Method: 使用事件驱动的神经形态传感器，通过脉冲无线电传输事件信号；采用基于e值的在线假设检验方法控制FDR；将传感器查询策略建模为多臂老虎机问题中的最优臂识别问题进行动态优化。

Conclusion: 所提出的框架能够在满足严格FDR控制的同时，实现高效的传感器调度和低延迟异常检测，适用于资源受限的神经形态无线传感器网络应用。

Abstract: This paper proposes a low-power online anomaly detection framework based on
neuromorphic wireless sensor networks, encompassing possible use cases such as
brain-machine interfaces and remote environmental monitoring. In the considered
system, a central reader node actively queries a subset of neuromorphic sensor
nodes (neuro-SNs) at each time frame. The neuromorphic sensors are
event-driven, producing spikes in correspondence to relevant changes in the
monitored system. The queried neuro-SNs respond to the reader with impulse
radio (IR) transmissions that directly encode the sensed local events. The
reader processes these event-driven signals to determine whether the monitored
environment is in a normal or anomalous state, while rigorously controlling the
false discovery rate (FDR) of detections below a predefined threshold. The
proposed approach employs an online hypothesis testing method with e-values to
maintain FDR control without requiring knowledge of the anomaly rate, and it
dynamically optimizes the sensor querying strategy by casting it as a best-arm
identification problem in a multi-armed bandit framework. Extensive performance
evaluation demonstrates that the proposed method can reliably detect anomalies
under stringent FDR requirements, while efficiently scheduling sensor
communications and achieving low detection latency.

Abstract: The rapid expansion of IoT devices has outpaced current identification
methods, creating significant risks for security, privacy, and network
accountability. These challenges are heightened in open-world environments,
where traffic metadata is often incomplete, noisy, or intentionally obfuscated.
We introduce a semantic inference pipeline that reframes device identification
as a language modeling task over heterogeneous network metadata. To construct
reliable supervision, we generate high-fidelity vendor labels for the IoT
Inspector dataset, the largest real-world IoT traffic corpus, using an ensemble
of large language models guided by mutual-information and entropy-based
stability scores. We then instruction-tune a quantized LLaMA3.18B model with
curriculum learning to support generalization under sparsity and long-tail
vendor distributions. Our model achieves 98.25% top-1 accuracy and 90.73% macro
accuracy across 2,015 vendors while maintaining resilience to missing fields,
protocol drift, and adversarial manipulation. Evaluation on an independent IoT
testbed, coupled with explanation quality and adversarial stress tests,
demonstrates that instruction-tuned LLMs provide a scalable and interpretable
foundation for real-world device identification at scale.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决日益增长的隐私和伦理问题，研究如何从训练好的模型中移除特定数据，而无需从头重新训练模型。

Conclusion: 梯度上升方法能够成功实现机器遗忘，同时在合成高斯混合设置中保持模型的泛化能力。

Abstract: Machine Unlearning aims to remove specific data from trained models,
addressing growing privacy and ethical concerns. We provide a theoretical
analysis of a simple and widely used method - gradient ascent - used to reverse
the influence of a specific data point without retraining from scratch.
Leveraging the implicit bias of gradient descent towards solutions that satisfy
the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions of a margin maximization problem, we
quantify the quality of the unlearned model by evaluating how well it satisfies
these conditions w.r.t. the retained data. To formalize this idea, we propose a
new success criterion, termed \textbf{$(\epsilon, \delta, \tau)$-successful}
unlearning, and show that, for both linear models and two-layer neural networks
with high dimensional data, a properly scaled gradient-ascent step satisfies
this criterion and yields a model that closely approximates the retrained
solution on the retained data. We also show that gradient ascent performs
successful unlearning while still preserving generalization in a synthetic
Gaussian-mixture setting.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为STDW的自训练动态加权方法，通过动态权重机制平衡源域和目标域的损失贡献，解决渐进域适应中的知识迁移挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统渐进域适应方法通过中间域和自训练缓解域偏移，但存在知识迁移效率低或中间数据不完整的问题，需要更稳健的适应方法。

Method: 引入动态权重机制，使用时变超参数ϱ控制域特定学习强度，结合自训练生成伪标签并优化加权目标函数进行迭代模型更新。

Result: 在旋转MNIST、颜色偏移MNIST、肖像数据集和Cover Type数据集上的实验表明，STDW优于现有基线方法，消融研究验证了ϱ动态调度的重要性。

Conclusion: STDW通过渐进适应减少域偏差并提高泛化能力，为稳健的渐进域适应提供了理论见解和实用框架，适用于动态现实场景。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new method called Self-Training with Dynamic
Weighting (STDW), which aims to enhance robustness in Gradual Domain Adaptation
(GDA) by addressing the challenge of smooth knowledge migration from the source
to the target domain. Traditional GDA methods mitigate domain shift through
intermediate domains and self-training but often suffer from inefficient
knowledge migration or incomplete intermediate data. Our approach introduces a
dynamic weighting mechanism that adaptively balances the loss contributions of
the source and target domains during training. Specifically, we design an
optimization framework governed by a time-varying hyperparameter $\varrho$
(progressing from 0 to 1), which controls the strength of domain-specific
learning and ensures stable adaptation. The method leverages self-training to
generate pseudo-labels and optimizes a weighted objective function for
iterative model updates, maintaining robustness across intermediate domains.
Experiments on rotated MNIST, color-shifted MNIST, portrait datasets, and the
Cover Type dataset demonstrate that STDW outperforms existing baselines.
Ablation studies further validate the critical role of $\varrho$'s dynamic
scheduling in achieving progressive adaptation, confirming its effectiveness in
reducing domain bias and improving generalization. This work provides both
theoretical insights and a practical framework for robust gradual domain
adaptation, with potential applications in dynamic real-world scenarios. The

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于神经网络在深度特征的高频分量中编码任务相关语义信息，而在低频分量中存储领域特定偏差的假设，旨在提取更通用的表示。

Method: 从原始特征中减去低通滤波输出，隔离可泛化表示，同时保持架构完整性。

Conclusion: 该方法实现了特征稀疏化并有效隔离高频分量，为核心假设提供了实证验证，代码已开源。

Abstract: We introduce the Deep Edge Filter, a novel approach that applies high-pass
filtering to deep neural network features to improve model generalizability.
Our method is motivated by our hypothesis that neural networks encode
task-relevant semantic information in high-frequency components while storing
domain-specific biases in low-frequency components of deep features. By
subtracting low-pass filtered outputs from original features, our approach
isolates generalizable representations while preserving architectural
integrity. Experimental results across diverse domains such as Vision, Text,
3D, and Audio demonstrate consistent performance improvements regardless of
model architecture and data modality. Analysis reveals that our method induces
feature sparsification and effectively isolates high-frequency components,
providing empirical validation of our core hypothesis. The code is available at

TL;DR: CoLoR-GAN：一种用于GAN的持续少样本学习框架，通过低秩适配器减少参数数量，解决持续学习中的灾难性遗忘问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法如LFS-GAN在每次训练迭代中引入大量新权重，长期来看参数负担显著。需要一种既能处理少样本学习又能进行持续学习的高效方法。

Method: 使用低秩张量适应目标任务，提出LoRA in LoRA (LLoRA)技术优化卷积层适配器大小，并提供超参数选择的实证研究。

Result: 在多个基准CL和FS任务上的实验表明，CoLoR-GAN高效且达到SOTA性能，同时大幅减少所需资源。

Conclusion: CoLoR-GAN通过低秩适配有效解决了GAN中的持续少样本学习问题，在保持高性能的同时显著降低了参数需求。

Abstract: Continual learning (CL) in the context of Generative Adversarial Networks
(GANs) remains a challenging problem, particularly when it comes to learn from
a few-shot (FS) samples without catastrophic forgetting. Current most effective
state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, like LFS-GAN, introduce a non-negligible
quantity of new weights at each training iteration, which would become
significant when considering the long term. For this reason, this paper
introduces \textcolor{red}{\textbf{\underline{c}}}ontinual
few-sh\textcolor{red}{\textbf{\underline{o}}}t learning with
\textcolor{red}{\textbf{\underline{lo}}}w-\textcolor{red}{\textbf{\underline{r}}}ank
adaptation in GANs named CoLoR-GAN, a framework designed to handle both FS and
CL together, leveraging low-rank tensors to efficiently adapt the model to
target tasks while reducing even more the number of parameters required.
Applying a vanilla LoRA implementation already permitted us to obtain pretty
good results. In order to optimize even further the size of the adapters, we
challenged LoRA limits introducing a LoRA in LoRA (LLoRA) technique for
convolutional layers. Finally, aware of the criticality linked to the choice of
the hyperparameters of LoRA, we provide an empirical study to easily find the
best ones. We demonstrate the effectiveness of CoLoR-GAN through experiments on
several benchmark CL and FS tasks and show that our model is efficient,
reaching SOTA performance but with a number of resources enormously reduced.

TL;DR: 提出一种结合对抗训练的统一框架，同时实现鲁棒分类和高质量生成建模，解决了传统联合能量模型训练不稳定和样本质量差的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统联合能量模型（JEM）在实现鲁棒分类和高质量生成建模时面临SGLD训练不稳定和样本质量差的问题，需要一种更稳定的训练方法。

Method: 采用对抗训练原则，用PGD生成的对比样本优化能量函数，结合协同对抗训练增强分类鲁棒性，并采用两阶段训练解决批归一化与EBM训练的不兼容性。

Result: 在CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100和ImageNet上显著提升对抗鲁棒性，生成质量接近扩散模型，是首个在复杂高分辨率数据集上实现高质量生成的MCMC-based EBM方法。

Conclusion: 对抗训练可作为统一框架的有效基础，同时实现视觉数据的生成和鲁棒分类，解决了JEM扩展的关键稳定性问题。

Abstract: Simultaneously achieving robust classification and high-fidelity generative
modeling within a single framework presents a significant challenge. Hybrid
approaches, such as Joint Energy-Based Models (JEM), interpret classifiers as
EBMs but are often limited by the instability and poor sample quality inherent
in SGLD-based training. We address these limitations by proposing a novel
training framework that integrates adversarial training (AT) principles for
both discriminative robustness and stable generative learning. The proposed
method introduces three key innovations: (1) the replacement of SGLD-based JEM
learning with a stable, AT-based approach that optimizes the energy function by
discriminating between real data and PGD-generated contrastive samples using
the BCE loss; (2) synergistic adversarial training for the discriminative
component that enhances classification robustness while eliminating the need
for explicit gradient penalties; and (3) a two-stage training procedure to
resolve the incompatibility between batch normalization and EBM training.
Experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet demonstrate that our method
substantially improves adversarial robustness over existing hybrid models while
maintaining competitive generative performance. On ImageNet, when optimized for
generative modeling, our model's generative fidelity surpasses that of BigGAN
and approaches diffusion models, representing the first MCMC-based EBM approach
to achieve high-quality generation on complex, high-resolution datasets. Our
approach addresses key stability issues that have limited JEM scaling and
demonstrates that adversarial training can serve as an effective foundation for
unified frameworks capable of generating and robustly classifying visual data.

*Xiaoyu Ma,Hao Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文揭示了多模态学习中不仅存在表征层面的不平衡，还在决策层表现出显著的系统性偏差。研究发现即使经过充分预训练和平衡优化，模型仍偏向某些模态（如音频）。这种偏差源于特征空间和决策权重分布的内在差异，而非仅优化动态。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态学习常受模态不平衡问题困扰，主导模态在联合优化过程中会压制较弱模态。本文旨在揭示这种不平衡不仅发生在表征学习阶段，更在决策层显著显现，影响模型性能。

Method: 在音频-视觉数据集（CREMAD和Kinetic-Sounds）上进行实验，分析预训练和平衡优化后模型的模态偏差。通过特征空间和决策权重分布分析，识别偏差来源。

Result: 实验表明即使经过充分优化，模型仍系统性偏向某些模态。分析证实这种偏差源于特征空间和决策权重分布的内在差异，而非优化过程本身。融合阶段未校准的模态输出聚合导致决策层权重偏差。

Conclusion: 未来多模态系统应在决策层引入自适应权重分配机制，根据各模态能力进行相对平衡的权重分配，以解决模态不平衡问题。

Abstract: Multimodal learning integrates information from different modalities to
enhance model performance, yet it often suffers from modality imbalance, where
dominant modalities overshadow weaker ones during joint optimization. This
paper reveals that such an imbalance not only occurs during representation
learning but also manifests significantly at the decision layer. Experiments on
audio-visual datasets (CREMAD and Kinetic-Sounds) show that even after
extensive pretraining and balanced optimization, models still exhibit
systematic bias toward certain modalities, such as audio. Further analysis
demonstrates that this bias originates from intrinsic disparities in
feature-space and decision-weight distributions rather than from optimization
dynamics alone. We argue that aggregating uncalibrated modality outputs at the
fusion stage leads to biased decision-layer weighting, hindering weaker
modalities from contributing effectively. To address this, we propose that
future multimodal systems should focus more on incorporate adaptive weight
allocation mechanisms at the decision layer, enabling relative balanced
according to the capabilities of each modality.

TL;DR: K-frames提出了一种场景驱动的关键帧选择新范式，通过预测语义连贯的查询相关片段来保持时间连续性，支持任意数量的关键帧选择以适应不同用户预算。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态大语言模型在长视频理解中受到上下文窗口和计算成本的限制。均匀帧采样会导致大量信息丢失，而现有的关键帧选择方法（如文本帧检索或基于强化学习的帧优化）通常产生稀疏且时间不连续的帧，忽略了场景连续性，缺乏多尺度帧选择的灵活性。

Method: 首先构建了包含20万个视频高光片段的PeakClips数据集。然后采用三阶段渐进式课程学习：两个监督微调阶段用于时间定位和关键片段感知，以及一个强化学习阶段直接优化场景驱动预测策略，无需进一步标注即可适应下游任务。

Result: 在主要的长视频理解基准测试中进行的广泛实验表明，K-frames在各种尺度上为关键帧选择提供了有效、可解释且即插即用的解决方案。

Conclusion: K-frames通过场景驱动的关键帧选择方法，有效解决了长视频理解中的信息损失和计算效率问题，提供了一种保持时间连续性的灵活多尺度帧选择方案。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant
capabilities in image understanding, but long-video are constrained by context
windows and computational cost. Uniform frame sampling often leads to
substantial information loss. Meanwhile existing keyframe selection methods
such as text-frame retrieval or RL-based frame optimization typically yield
sparse and temporally disjointed frames, overlooking scene continuity and
lacking flexibility for multi-scale frame selection. To address these
limitations, we introduce K-frames, a novel paradigm for scene-driven keyframe
selection that preserves temporal continuity. Instead of selecting individual
frames, K-frames predicts semantically coherent, query-relevant clips, which
enables any-k keyframes selection to meet diverse user budgets. To achieve this
approach, we first introduce PeakClips, a dataset of 200K video highlights
conditioned by query. Building on this dataset, K-frames learns clip2frame
selection using a three-stage progressive curriculum. It involves two
Supervised Fine-Tuning stages for temporal grounding and key-clip perception,
followed by a Reinforcement Learning stage that directly optimizes the
scene-driven prediction policy for downstream task without further annotations.
Extensive experiments on major long-video understanding benchmarks demonstrate
that K-frames provides an effective, interpretable, and plug-and-play solution
for keyframe selection at various scales. Our dataset and model will be
available.

*Zixian Yang,Sushil Mahavir Varma,Lei Ying*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文研究双边市场中的定价和匹配算法，通过在线学习实现近最优的利润最大化，同时控制队列长度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在双边市场中，平台需要平衡利润最大化和队列长度控制，但实践中需求和供给曲线往往未知，因此需要设计不依赖这些信息的在线学习算法。

Method: 提出了一种新颖的在线学习定价策略，包含动态组件优化遗憾与队列长度的权衡，以及概率组件解决快速学习与队列控制之间的张力。

Result: 证明了三个性能指标之间的权衡关系：$\tilde{O}(T^{1-\gamma})$遗憾、$\tilde{O}(T^{\gamma/2})$平均队列长度和$\tilde{O}(T^{\gamma})$最大队列长度，其中$\gamma \\in (0, 1/6]$，显著优于现有结果。

Conclusion: 该策略在允许的$\gamma$范围内实现了遗憾与平均队列长度之间的最优权衡，匹配了已知需求和供给曲线情况下的最优性能。

Abstract: We study a two-sided market, wherein, price-sensitive heterogeneous customers
and servers arrive and join their respective queues. A compatible
customer-server pair can then be matched by the platform, at which point, they
leave the system. Our objective is to design pricing and matching algorithms
that maximize the platform's profit, while maintaining reasonable queue
lengths. As the demand and supply curves governing the price-dependent arrival
rates may not be known in practice, we design a novel online-learning-based
pricing policy and establish its near-optimality. In particular, we prove a
tradeoff among three performance metrics: $\tilde{O}(T^{1-\gamma})$ regret,
$\tilde{O}(T^{\gamma/2})$ average queue length, and $\tilde{O}(T^{\gamma})$
maximum queue length for $\gamma \in (0, 1/6]$, significantly improving over
existing results [1]. Moreover, barring the permissible range of $\gamma$, we
show that this trade-off between regret and average queue length is optimal up
to logarithmic factors under a class of policies, matching the optimal one as
in [2] which assumes the demand and supply curves to be known. Our proposed
policy has two noteworthy features: a dynamic component that optimizes the
tradeoff between low regret and small queue lengths; and a probabilistic
component that resolves the tension between obtaining useful samples for fast
learning and maintaining small queue lengths.

TL;DR: 提出多视图半监督标签分布学习方法MVSS-LDL，通过局部结构互补性解决多视图标签分布学习问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有标签分布学习方法仅针对单视图和全标注数据，而多视图半监督标签分布学习问题尚未被考虑

Method: 利用每个视图的局部最近邻结构，强调多视图间局部最近邻结构的互补性，通过图学习构建多视图半监督标签分布学习模型

Result: 数值研究表明MVSS-LDL比现有单视图标签分布学习方法获得明显更好的分类性能

Conclusion: 这是首次尝试多视图标签分布学习，通过局部结构互补性有效提升了分类性能

Abstract: Label distribution learning (LDL) is a paradigm that each sample is
associated with a label distribution. At present, the existing approaches are
proposed for the single-view LDL problem with labeled data, while the
multi-view LDL problem with labeled and unlabeled data has not been considered.
In this paper, we put forward the multi-view semi-supervised label distribution
learning with local structure complementarity (MVSS-LDL) approach, which
exploits the local nearest neighbor structure of each view and emphasizes the
complementarity of local nearest neighbor structures in multiple views.
Specifically speaking, we first explore the local structure of view $v$ by
computing the $k$-nearest neighbors. As a result, the $k$-nearest neighbor set
of each sample $\boldsymbol{x}_i$ in view $v$ is attained. Nevertheless, this
$k$-nearest neighbor set describes only a part of the nearest neighbor
information of sample $\boldsymbol{x}_i$. In order to obtain a more
comprehensive description of sample $\boldsymbol{x}_i$'s nearest neighbors, we
complement the nearest neighbor set in view $v$ by incorporating sample
$\boldsymbol{x}_i$'s nearest neighbors in other views. Lastly, based on the
complemented nearest neighbor set in each view, a graph learning-based
multi-view semi-supervised LDL model is constructed. By considering the
complementarity of local nearest neighbor structures, different views can
mutually provide the local structural information to complement each other. To
the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt at multi-view LDL.
Numerical studies have demonstrated that MVSS-LDL attains explicitly better
classification performance than the existing single-view LDL methods.

*Levy Chaves,Eduardo Valle,Sandra Avila*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为Weight Weaving的即插即用技术，通过用户定义的池化函数在λ值搜索空间中汇集模型权重，无需评估数据即可提升模型合并性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型合并方法严重依赖缩放超参数λ，但缺乏无需数据的原则性设置方法，导致研究者不得不使用评估数据进行调优，这在实践中不可行。

Method: Weight Weaving技术使用用户定义的池化函数（如平均、随机选择或现有合并方法）在λ值搜索空间中汇集模型权重，具有高模块性和最小约束。

Result: 在三个ViT变体和三个实验设置（视觉多任务学习、持续学习和领域泛化）中验证，该方法持续提升多个模型合并方法的性能，在无数据设置下平均准确率提升高达15.9个百分点。

Conclusion: Weight Weaving提供了一种正交于现有模型合并方法且无需评估数据的有效解决方案，显著提升了模型合并的性能。

Abstract: Model merging provides a cost-effective and data-efficient combination of
specialized deep neural networks through parameter integration. This technique
leverages expert models across downstream tasks without requiring retraining.
Most model merging approaches critically depend on scaling hyper-parameters
$\lambda$, which weight each model's contribution globally or individually.
Principled approaches for setting scaling factors without accessing any data
(data-free) are scarce, often leading researchers to tune $\lambda$ using
privileged data from the evaluation set, which is obviously unfeasible in
practice. To address this limitation, we introduce Weight Weaving, a
plug-and-play technique that pools model weights across $\lambda$ values search
space using user-defined pooling functions, such as averaging, random
selection, or even existing model merging methods. Our method demonstrates high
modularity, imposing minimal constraints on the search space. It operates
orthogonally to existing model merging methods and eliminates evaluation data
requirements. We validate Weight Weaving across three ViT variants in three
experimental setups: vision multi-task learning, vision continual learning, and
domain generalization. Our method consistently improves the performance of
several model merging methods, achieving average accuracy gains of up to 15.9
percentage points in a data-free setting.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床笔记中的ICD诊断编码顺序对医疗诊断和报销至关重要，但现有方法将其视为分类任务，忽略了编码顺序。

Method: 从检索系统角度处理该任务，将其制定为分类和排序任务，同时考虑编码分配和优先级排序。

Result: 在主要诊断编码排序准确率上达到47%（相比现有最佳方法的20%），在分类指标上微平均F1为0.6065，宏平均F1为0.2904，均优于之前最佳模型。

Conclusion: 提出的分类-排序框架在识别高优先级编码方面具有优越能力，同时保持了良好的分类性能。

Abstract: Clinical notes contain unstructured text provided by clinicians during
patient encounters. These notes are usually accompanied by a sequence of
diagnostic codes following the International Classification of Diseases (ICD).
Correctly assigning and ordering ICD codes are essential for medical diagnosis
and reimbursement. However, automating this task remains challenging.
State-of-the-art methods treated this problem as a classification task, leading
to ignoring the order of ICD codes that is essential for different purposes. In
this work, as a first attempt, we approach this task from a retrieval system
perspective to consider the order of codes, thus formulating this problem as a
classification and ranking task. Our results and analysis show that the
proposed framework has a superior ability to identify high-priority codes
compared to other methods. For instance, our model accuracy in correctly
ranking primary diagnosis codes is 47%, compared to 20% for the
state-of-the-art classifier. Additionally, in terms of classification metrics,
the proposed model achieves a micro- and macro-F1 scores of 0.6065 and 0.2904,
respectively, surpassing the previous best model with scores of 0.597 and
0.2660.

*George Webber,Andrew J. Reader*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的数据保真度损失函数——分布一致性损失，用于解决逆问题中传统点对点匹配方法容易过拟合噪声的问题。该方法通过检验观测数据与当前估计所隐含的噪声分布是否统计一致来评估数据保真度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的数据保真度损失函数如均方误差或负对数似然寻求与噪声测量的点对点一致性，这通常会导致对噪声的过拟合。本文旨在开发一种更稳健的数据保真度评估方法。

Method: 引入分布一致性损失，用基于模型的概率分数对每个测量值进行分布级校准，替代传统的点对点匹配。该方法与现代正则化器兼容，优化方式与传统损失相同。

Result: 在图像去噪中，使用DC损失代替MSE损失无需提前停止训练即可获得更高的PSNR；在医学图像重建中，DC损失减少了高度迭代重建中的伪影，并增强了手工正则化的效果。

Conclusion: DC损失为逆问题提供了一个统计基础扎实、性能增强的替代传统保真度损失的方法，特别适用于测量噪声分布已知且测量数据集包含许多独立噪声值的实际逆问题。

Abstract: Recovering true signals from noisy measurements is a central challenge in
inverse problems spanning medical imaging, geophysics, and signal processing.
Current solutions balance prior assumptions regarding the true signal
(regularization) with agreement to noisy measured data (data-fidelity).
Conventional data-fidelity loss functions, such as mean-squared error (MSE) or
negative log-likelihood, seek pointwise agreement with noisy measurements,
often leading to overfitting to noise. In this work, we instead evaluate
data-fidelity collectively by testing whether the observed measurements are
statistically consistent with the noise distributions implied by the current
estimate. We adopt this aggregated perspective and introduce distributional
consistency (DC) loss, a data-fidelity objective that replaces pointwise
matching with distribution-level calibration using model-based probability
scores for each measurement. DC loss acts as a direct and practical plug-in
replacement for standard data consistency terms: i) it is compatible with
modern regularizers, ii) it is optimized in the same way as traditional losses,
and iii) it avoids overfitting to measurement noise even without the use of
priors. Its scope naturally fits many practical inverse problems where the
measurement-noise distribution is known and where the measured dataset consists
of many independent noisy values. We demonstrate efficacy in two key example
application areas: i) in image denoising with deep image prior, using DC
instead of MSE loss removes the need for early stopping and achieves higher
PSNR; ii) in medical image reconstruction from Poisson-noisy data, DC loss
reduces artifacts in highly-iterated reconstructions and enhances the efficacy
of hand-crafted regularization. These results position DC loss as a
statistically grounded, performance-enhancing alternative to conventional
fidelity losses for inverse problems.

TL;DR: BitNet Distillation (BitDistill) 是一种轻量级方法，可将现成的全精度大语言模型微调为1.58位精度（三元权重{-1, 0, 1}），在特定下游任务上实现接近全精度模型的性能，同时显著降低内存占用和加速推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决全精度大语言模型在特定任务上部署时的高计算成本和内存需求问题，通过量化技术实现高效推理。

Method: 结合三种关键技术：BitNet中的SubLN模块、基于MiniLM的多头注意力蒸馏、以及作为关键预热步骤的持续预训练。

Result: 在多种模型规模下，BitDistill实现了与全精度对应模型相当的性能，同时实现高达10倍的内存节省和2.65倍的CPU推理加速。

Conclusion: BitDistill提供了一种有效的方法，能够在保持任务特定性能的同时，显著降低大语言模型的部署成本，为资源受限环境下的高效推理提供了可行方案。

Abstract: In this paper, we present BitNet Distillation (BitDistill), a lightweight
pipeline that fine-tunes off-the-shelf full-precision LLMs (e.g., Qwen) into
1.58-bit precision (i.e., ternary weights {-1, 0, 1}) for specific downstream
tasks, achieving strong task-specific performance with minimal computational
cost. Specifically, BitDistill incorporates three key techniques: the SubLN
module, as introduced in BitNet; multi-head attention distillation, based on
MiniLM; and continual pre-training, which serves as a crucial warm-up step to
mitigate the scalability issue of the performance gap between finetuned
full-precision and 1.58-bit LLMs on specific tasks. Experimental results show
that BitDistill achieves performance comparable to the full-precision
counterpart models across model size, while enabling up to 10x memory savings
and 2.65x faster inference on CPUs. Code is available at

Motivation: SMoE模型参数量大导致内存开销严重，现有专家合并方法在生成任务中效果不佳，需要更有效的压缩策略。

Method: 提出Router-weighted Expert Activation Pruning (REAP)方法，综合考虑路由器门控值和专家激活范数进行剪枝，避免功能子空间坍塌问题。

Result: 在20B到1T参数的多种SMoE模型上，REAP在生成基准测试中始终优于合并和其他剪枝方法，特别是在50%压缩率下。在代码生成和工具调用任务中，即使剪枝50%专家也能实现接近无损压缩。

Conclusion: 专家剪枝是生成任务中更优的压缩策略，REAP方法通过避免功能子空间坍塌问题，实现了高效的模型压缩。

Abstract: Sparsely-activated Mixture-of-Experts (SMoE) models offer efficient
pre-training and low latency but their large parameter counts create
significant memory overhead, motivating research into expert compression.
Contrary to recent findings favouring expert merging on discriminative
benchmarks, we demonstrate that expert pruning is a superior strategy for
generative tasks. We prove that merging introduces an irreducible error by
causing a "functional subspace collapse", due to the loss of the router's
independent, input-dependent control over experts. Leveraging this insight, we
propose Router-weighted Expert Activation Pruning (REAP), a novel pruning
criterion that considers both router gate-values and expert activation norms.
Across a diverse set of SMoE models ranging from 20B to 1T parameters, REAP
consistently outperforms merging and other pruning methods on generative
benchmarks, especially at 50% compression. Notably, our method achieves
near-lossless compression on code generation and tool-calling tasks with
Qwen3-Coder-480B and Kimi-K2, even after pruning 50% of experts.

Motivation: 现有的Clifford可操纵CNN（CSCNNs）的核基不完备，限制了模型的表达能力，需要解决这一问题。

Method: 提出条件Clifford可操纵核，通过输入特征场计算等变表示来增强核基，并通过隐式参数化高效求解等变约束。

Result: 在多个PDE预测任务（包括流体动力学和相对论电动力学）上，该方法始终优于基线方法，证明了其改进的表达能力。

Conclusion: 条件Clifford可操纵核有效解决了CSCNNs核基不完备的问题，显著提升了模型在物理系统预测任务中的性能。

Abstract: Clifford-Steerable CNNs (CSCNNs) provide a unified framework that allows
incorporating equivariance to arbitrary pseudo-Euclidean groups, including
isometries of Euclidean space and Minkowski spacetime. In this work, we
demonstrate that the kernel basis of CSCNNs is not complete, thus limiting the
model expressivity. To address this issue, we propose Conditional
Clifford-Steerable Kernels, which augment the kernels with equivariant
representations computed from the input feature field. We derive the
equivariance constraint for these input-dependent kernels and show how it can
be solved efficiently via implicit parameterization. We empirically demonstrate
an improved expressivity of the resulting framework on multiple PDE forecasting
tasks, including fluid dynamics and relativistic electrodynamics, where our
method consistently outperforms baseline methods.

TL;DR: 提出了一种在几何感知优化算法基础上的噪声自适应分层学习率方案，通过估计对偶范数中的梯度方差来动态调整各层学习率，显著加速了深度神经网络训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的几何感知优化算法（如Muon）虽然通过为不同层选择适当范数来利用DNN的几何结构，但在同一范数组内的层间使用固定学习率，忽略了层间局部曲率的异质性和训练过程中的动态变化，导致训练效率不高。

Method: 在几何感知优化算法基础上引入噪声自适应分层学习率方案，实时估计由所选线性最小化oracle诱导的对偶范数中的梯度方差，并利用该方差为每个组内的层分配时变的噪声自适应学习率。

Result: 理论分析表明该算法达到了尖锐的收敛率。在LLaMA和GPT等transformer架构上的实证结果显示，相比最先进的优化器，该方法实现了更快的收敛速度。

Conclusion: 提出的噪声自适应分层学习率方案能够有效解决几何感知优化中固定学习率的问题，通过动态调整层间学习率显著提升了DNN训练效率，在transformer架构上表现优异。

Abstract: Geometry-aware optimization algorithms, such as Muon, have achieved
remarkable success in training deep neural networks (DNNs). These methods
leverage the underlying geometry of DNNs by selecting appropriate norms for
different layers and updating parameters via norm-constrained linear
minimization oracles (LMOs). However, even within a group of layers associated
with the same norm, the local curvature can be heterogeneous across layers and
vary dynamically over the course of training. For example, recent work shows
that sharpness varies substantially across transformer layers and throughout
training, yet standard geometry-aware optimizers impose fixed learning rates to
layers within the same group, which may be inefficient for DNN training.
  In this paper, we introduce a noise-adaptive layerwise learning rate scheme
on top of geometry-aware optimization algorithms and substantially accelerate
DNN training compared to methods that use fixed learning rates within each
group. Our method estimates gradient variance in the dual norm induced by the
chosen LMO on the fly, and uses it to assign time-varying noise-adaptive
layerwise learning rates within each group. We provide a theoretical analysis
showing that our algorithm achieves a sharp convergence rate. Empirical results
on transformer architectures such as LLaMA and GPT demonstrate that our
approach achieves faster convergence than state-of-the-art optimizers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer存在二次复杂度和长序列依赖处理困难的问题，而现有状态空间模型（如Mamba的S6模块）的选择性机制仅依赖当前输入，缺乏对序列历史的有效利用。

Method: 提出COFFEE模型，通过状态反馈机制从内部状态计算选择性，内部状态作为序列历史的紧凑表示；采用高效参数化方法消除S6中的冗余。

Result: 在induction head任务中，COFFEE以少两个数量级的参数和训练序列达到接近完美的准确率；在MNIST上仅用3585参数达到97%准确率，大幅超越S6。

Conclusion: 状态反馈是构建可扩展高效序列模型的关键机制，COFFEE展示了其在参数效率和长序列依赖捕捉方面的优势。

Abstract: Transformers, powered by the attention mechanism, are the backbone of most
foundation models, yet they suffer from quadratic complexity and difficulties
in dealing with long-range dependencies in the input sequence. Recent work has
shown that state space models (SSMs) provide an efficient alternative, with the
S6 module at the core of the Mamba architecture achieving state-of-the-art
results on long-sequence benchmarks. In this paper, we introduce the COFFEE
(COntext From FEEdback) model, a novel time-varying SSM that incorporates state
feedback to enable context-dependent selectivity, while still allowing for
parallel implementation. Whereas the selectivity mechanism of S6 only depends
on the current input, COFFEE computes it from the internal state, which serves
as a compact representation of the sequence history. This shift allows the
model to regulate its dynamics based on accumulated context, improving its
ability to capture long-range dependencies. In addition to state feedback, we
employ an efficient model parametrization that removes redundancies present in
S6 and leads to a more compact and trainable formulation. On the induction head
task, COFFEE achieves near-perfect accuracy with two orders of magnitude fewer
parameters and training sequences compared to S6. On MNIST, COFFEE largely
outperforms S6 within the same architecture, reaching 97% accuracy with only
3585 parameters. These results showcase the role of state feedback as a key
mechanism for building scalable and efficient sequence models.

Conclusion: 该基准为从业者和新手提供了评估代表性CRL方法的平台，并提供了实证见解，帮助选择或扩展适当的CRL框架来解决能从CRL视角受益的特定类型现实问题。

Abstract: Causal Representation Learning (CRL) aims to uncover the data-generating
process and identify the underlying causal variables and relations, whose
evaluation remains inherently challenging due to the requirement of known
ground-truth causal variables and causal structure. Existing evaluations often
rely on either simplistic synthetic datasets or downstream performance on
real-world tasks, generally suffering a dilemma between realism and evaluative
precision. In this paper, we introduce a new benchmark for CRL using
high-fidelity simulated visual data that retains both realistic visual
complexity and, more importantly, access to ground-truth causal generating
processes. The dataset comprises around 200 thousand images and 3 million video
frames across 24 sub-scenes in four domains: static image generation, dynamic
physical simulations, robotic manipulations, and traffic situation analysis.
These scenarios range from static to dynamic settings, simple to complex
structures, and single to multi-agent interactions, offering a comprehensive
testbed that hopefully bridges the gap between rigorous evaluation and
real-world applicability. In addition, we provide flexible access to the
underlying causal structures, allowing users to modify or configure them to
align with the required assumptions in CRL, such as available domain labels,
temporal dependencies, or intervention histories. Leveraging this benchmark, we
evaluated representative CRL methods across diverse paradigms and offered
empirical insights to assist practitioners and newcomers in choosing or
extending appropriate CRL frameworks to properly address specific types of real
problems that can benefit from the CRL perspective. Welcome to visit our:

Abstract: Fine-tuning pre-trained large language models (LLMs) has become a common
practice for personalized natural language understanding (NLU) applications on
downstream tasks and domain-specific datasets. However, there are two main
challenges: (i) limited and/or heterogeneous data for fine-tuning due to
proprietary data confidentiality or privacy requirements, and (ii) varying
computation resources available across participating clients such as edge
devices. This paper presents FedHFT - an efficient and personalized federated
fine-tuning framework to address both challenges. First, we introduce a mixture
of masked adapters to handle resource heterogeneity across participating
clients, enabling high-performance collaborative fine-tuning of pre-trained
language model(s) across multiple clients in a distributed setting, while
keeping proprietary data local. Second, we introduce a bi-level optimization
approach to handle non-iid data distribution based on masked personalization
and client clustering. Extensive experiments demonstrate significant
performance and efficiency improvements over various natural language
understanding tasks under data and resource heterogeneity compared to
representative heterogeneous federated learning methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究稀疏maxout网络的表达能力，这类网络捕捉了卷积神经网络和图神经网络的关键特征，需要理解其计算能力和结构限制。

Method: 建立稀疏maxout网络与虚拟多面体类之间的对偶关系，利用多面体几何分析网络表达能力，推导维度紧界作为核心分析工具。

Result: 构建了深度层次结构序列，证明足够深的稀疏maxout网络是通用的，但在固定入度约束下，如果深度不足，仅靠增加宽度无法弥补。

Conclusion: 稀疏maxout网络的表达能力与深度密切相关，在固定入度约束下，深度是决定网络表达能力的关键因素，宽度无法替代深度的作用。

Abstract: We study the expressivity of sparse maxout networks, where each neuron takes
a fixed number of inputs from the previous layer and employs a, possibly
multi-argument, maxout activation. This setting captures key characteristics of
convolutional or graph neural networks. We establish a duality between
functions computable by such networks and a class of virtual polytopes, linking
their geometry to questions of network expressivity. In particular, we derive a
tight bound on the dimension of the associated polytopes, which serves as the
central tool for our analysis. Building on this, we construct a sequence of
depth hierarchies. While sufficiently deep sparse maxout networks are
universal, we prove that if the required depth is not reached, width alone
cannot compensate for the sparsity of a fixed indegree constraint.

*Tommaso Mencattini,Riccardo Cadei,Francesco Locatello*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Neural Effect Search方法，直接从数据中发现未知的因果效应，无需预先假设，解决了传统随机对照试验依赖人工假设和昂贵分析的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统随机对照试验依赖手工构建的假设和昂贵的分析，限制了因果效应估计的规模，可能固守流行但不完整的假设。

Method: 使用预训练基础模型将试验的非结构化数据转化为有意义的表示，通过稀疏自编码器进行解释，并引入Neural Effect Search递归程序，通过渐进分层解决多重检验和效应纠缠问题。

Result: 在半合成实验中验证了算法的鲁棒性，并在实验生态学背景下首次成功实现了真实世界科学试验中的无监督因果效应识别。

Conclusion: Neural Effect Search能够直接从数据中发现未知的因果效应，为大规模因果发现提供了新途径。

Abstract: Randomized Controlled Trials are one of the pillars of science; nevertheless,
they rely on hand-crafted hypotheses and expensive analysis. Such constraints
prevent causal effect estimation at scale, potentially anchoring on popular yet
incomplete hypotheses. We propose to discover the unknown effects of a
treatment directly from data. For this, we turn unstructured data from a trial
into meaningful representations via pretrained foundation models and interpret
them via a sparse autoencoder. However, discovering significant causal effects
at the neural level is not trivial due to multiple-testing issues and effects
entanglement. To address these challenges, we introduce Neural Effect Search, a
novel recursive procedure solving both issues by progressive stratification.
After assessing the robustness of our algorithm on semi-synthetic experiments,
we showcase, in the context of experimental ecology, the first successful
unsupervised causal effect identification on a real-world scientific trial.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了Agentic Entropy-Balanced Policy Optimization (AEPO)算法，通过平衡熵信号来解决Agentic RL中过度依赖熵导致训练崩溃的问题，在14个数据集上优于7种主流RL算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 主流Agentic RL算法过度依赖熵信号来自主探索高不确定性工具调用步骤，但过度依赖熵会施加额外约束，导致训练崩溃。

Method: AEPO包含两个核心组件：(1)动态熵平衡rollout机制，通过熵预监测自适应分配全局和分支采样预算，并对连续高熵工具调用步骤施加分支惩罚；(2)熵平衡策略优化，在高熵裁剪项中插入停止梯度操作，并采用熵感知优势估计优先学习高不确定性token。

Result: 在14个挑战性数据集上，AEPO始终优于7种主流RL算法。仅用1K RL样本，Qwen3-14B模型在GAIA上达到47.6%(Pass@1)和65.0%(Pass@5)，在Humanity's Last Exam上达到11.2%(Pass@1)和26.0%(Pass@5)，在WebWalker上达到43.0%(Pass@1)和70.0%(Pass@5)。

Conclusion: AEPO提高了rollout采样多样性，同时保持稳定的策略熵，有助于可扩展的web agent训练。

Abstract: Recently, Agentic Reinforcement Learning (Agentic RL) has made significant
progress in incentivizing the multi-turn, long-horizon tool-use capabilities of
web agents. While mainstream agentic RL algorithms autonomously explore
high-uncertainty tool-call steps under the guidance of entropy, excessive
reliance on entropy signals can impose further constraints, leading to the
training collapse. In this paper, we delve into the challenges caused by
entropy and propose the Agentic Entropy-Balanced Policy Optimization (AEPO), an
agentic RL algorithm designed to balance entropy in both the rollout and policy
update phases. AEPO comprises two core components: (1) a dynamic
entropy-balanced rollout mechanism that adaptively allocate global and branch
sampling budget through entropy pre-monitoring, while imposing a branch penalty
on consecutive high-entropy tool-call steps to prevent over-branching issues;
and (2) Entropy-Balanced Policy Optimization that inserts a stop-gradient
operation into the high-entropy clipping term to preserve and properly rescale
gradients on high-entropy tokens, while incorporating entropy-aware advantage
estimation to prioritize learning on high-uncertainty tokens. Results across 14
challenging datasets show that AEPO consistently outperforms 7 mainstream RL
algorithms. With just 1K RL samples, Qwen3-14B with AEPO achieves impressive
results: 47.6% on GAIA, 11.2% on Humanity's Last Exam, and 43.0% on WebWalker
for Pass@1; 65.0% on GAIA, 26.0% on Humanity's Last Exam, and 70.0% on
WebWalker for Pass@5. Further analysis reveals that AEPO improves rollout
sampling diversity while maintaining stable policy entropy, facilitating
scalable web agent training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着神经网络在求解微分方程中的广泛应用，其为何能有效逼近这类解的理论基础仍不够充分，需要深入探索神经网络对反应扩散系统的逼近能力。

Result: 证明了两层神经网络可以逼近一维反应扩散方程，三层神经网络可以逼近二维反应扩散方程，该理论框架还可扩展到椭圆型和抛物型方程。

Conclusion: 这项工作凸显了神经网络在逼近反应扩散方程及相关偏微分方程解方面的表达能力，为基于神经网络的微分方程求解器提供了理论基础。

Abstract: Reaction-diffusion systems represent one of the most fundamental formulations
used to describe a wide range of physical, chemical, and biological processes.
With the increasing adoption of neural networks, recent research has focused on
solving differential equations using machine learning techniques. However, the
theoretical foundation explaining why neural networks can effectively
approximate such solutions remains insufficiently explored.
  This paper provides a theoretical analysis of the approximation power of
neural networks for one- and two-dimensional reaction-diffusion equations in
both homogeneous and heterogeneous media. Building upon the universal
approximation theorem, we demonstrate that a two-layer neural network can
approximate the one-dimensional reaction-diffusion equation, while a
three-layer neural network can approximate its two-dimensional counterpart. The
theoretical framework presented here can be further extended to elliptic and
parabolic equations.
  Overall, this work highlights the expressive power of neural networks in
approximating solutions to reaction-diffusion equations and related PDEs,
providing a theoretical foundation for neural network-based differential
equation solvers.

Motivation: 当前检索增强生成系统主要处理单模态文本数据，在处理包含文本、图像、表格、方程和图形的非结构化多模态文档时效果有限。

Method: MAHA采用模态感知混合检索架构，结合密集向量检索和结构化图遍历，通过知识图谱编码跨模态语义和关系。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上的评估显示，MAHA显著优于基线方法，ROUGE-L得分达到0.486，实现完整的模态覆盖。

Conclusion: MAHA建立了一个可扩展且可解释的检索框架，通过结合嵌入和显式文档结构，实现了对非结构化多模态数据的模态感知推理，推动了RAG系统的发展。

Abstract: Current Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems primarily operate on
unimodal textual data, limiting their effectiveness on unstructured multimodal
documents. Such documents often combine text, images, tables, equations, and
graphs, each contributing unique information. In this work, we present a
Modality-Aware Hybrid retrieval Architecture (MAHA), designed specifically for
multimodal question answering with reasoning through a modality-aware knowledge
graph. MAHA integrates dense vector retrieval with structured graph traversal,
where the knowledge graph encodes cross-modal semantics and relationships. This
design enables both semantically rich and context-aware retrieval across
diverse modalities. Evaluations on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that
MAHA substantially outperforms baseline methods, achieving a ROUGE-L score of
0.486, providing complete modality coverage. These results highlight MAHA's
ability to combine embeddings with explicit document structure, enabling
effective multimodal retrieval. Our work establishes a scalable and
interpretable retrieval framework that advances RAG systems by enabling
modality-aware reasoning over unstructured multimodal data.

Motivation: 系统性、组合性泛化能力超越训练分布仍然是机器学习的核心挑战，也是现代语言模型推理能力的关键瓶颈。

Method: 引入了四种架构机制：(i)输入自适应循环；(ii)算法监督；(iii)通过离散瓶颈的锚定潜在表示；(iv)显式纠错机制。

Result: 这些机制共同形成了一种在Transformer网络中实现原生和可扩展潜在空间推理的架构方法，具有强大的算法泛化能力。

Conclusion: 通过详细的机制可解释性分析揭示了这些机制如何产生稳健的OOD泛化能力。

Abstract: Systematic, compositional generalization beyond the training distribution
remains a core challenge in machine learning -- and a critical bottleneck for
the emergent reasoning abilities of modern language models. This work
investigates out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization in Transformer networks
using a GSM8K-style modular arithmetic on computational graphs task as a
testbed. We introduce and explore a set of four architectural mechanisms aimed
at enhancing OOD generalization: (i) input-adaptive recurrence; (ii)
algorithmic supervision; (iii) anchored latent representations via a discrete
bottleneck; and (iv) an explicit error-correction mechanism. Collectively,
these mechanisms yield an architectural approach for native and scalable latent
space reasoning in Transformer networks with robust algorithmic generalization
capabilities. We complement these empirical results with a detailed mechanistic
interpretability analysis that reveals how these mechanisms give rise to robust
OOD generalization abilities.

Conclusion: TENDE提供了一种灵活、可扩展的转移熵估计方法，突破了现有方法的局限性，为神经科学、金融和复杂系统分析等领域的应用提供了更有效的工具。

Abstract: Transfer entropy measures directed information flow in time series, and it
has become a fundamental quantity in applications spanning neuroscience,
finance, and complex systems analysis. However, existing estimation methods
suffer from the curse of dimensionality, require restrictive distributional
assumptions, or need exponentially large datasets for reliable convergence. We
address these limitations in the literature by proposing TENDE (Transfer
Entropy Neural Diffusion Estimation), a novel approach that leverages
score-based diffusion models to estimate transfer entropy through conditional
mutual information. By learning score functions of the relevant conditional
distributions, TENDE provides flexible, scalable estimation while making
minimal assumptions about the underlying data-generating process. We
demonstrate superior accuracy and robustness compared to existing neural
estimators and other state-of-the-art approaches across synthetic benchmarks
and real data.

Abstract: Diffusion models enable the synthesis of highly accurate samples from complex
distributions and have become foundational in generative modeling. Recently,
they have demonstrated significant potential for solving Bayesian inverse
problems by serving as priors. This review offers a comprehensive overview of
current methods that leverage \emph{pre-trained} diffusion models alongside
Monte Carlo methods to address Bayesian inverse problems without requiring
additional training. We show that these methods primarily employ a
\emph{twisting} mechanism for the intermediate distributions within the
diffusion process, guiding the simulations toward the posterior distribution.
We describe how various Monte Carlo methods are then used to aid in sampling
from these twisted distributions.

Abstract: We introduce a neural network-driven robust optimisation framework that
integrates data-driven domain as a constraint into the nonlinear programming
technique, addressing the overlooked issue of domain-inconsistent solutions

Conclusion: 改进的理解使SGCRL能够适应安全感知探索，为无监督强化学习的探索机制提供了理论洞见。

Abstract: In this work, we take a first step toward elucidating the mechanisms behind
emergent exploration in unsupervised reinforcement learning. We study
Single-Goal Contrastive Reinforcement Learning (SGCRL), a self-supervised
algorithm capable of solving challenging long-horizon goal-reaching tasks
without external rewards or curricula. We combine theoretical analysis of the
algorithm's objective function with controlled experiments to understand what
drives its exploration. We show that SGCRL maximizes implicit rewards shaped by
its learned representations. These representations automatically modify the
reward landscape to promote exploration before reaching the goal and
exploitation thereafter. Our experiments also demonstrate that these
exploration dynamics arise from learning low-rank representations of the state
space rather than from neural network function approximation. Our improved
understanding enables us to adapt SGCRL to perform safety-aware exploration.

TL;DR: 提出了解耦图卷积网络（D-GCN）用于异构多跳无线网络中p-persistent CSMA协议的饱和吞吐量预测，通过分离节点自身传输概率和邻居干扰效应，显著提升了预测精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统简化模型在稀疏拓扑中低估吞吐量48-62%，精确马尔可夫链分析计算复杂度指数增长，标准GCN因对称归一化混淆直接干扰与高阶级联效应导致63.94%的预测误差。

Method: D-GCN架构显式分离节点自身传输概率处理和邻居干扰效应，用可学习注意力机制替代均值聚合，捕获复杂多跳干扰模式。

Result: D-GCN达到3.3%的归一化平均绝对误差，优于强基线方法，在精确分析方法计算不可行时仍保持可处理性，基于梯度的网络优化达到理论最优值的1%以内。

Conclusion: D-GCN通过解耦干扰处理机制有效解决了无线网络吞吐量预测问题，为大规模网络性能分析和优化提供了实用工具。

Abstract: The p-persistent CSMA protocol is central to random-access MAC analysis, but
predicting saturation throughput in heterogeneous multi-hop wireless networks
remains a hard problem. Simplified models that assume a single, shared
interference domain can underestimate throughput by 48--62\% in sparse
topologies. Exact Markov-chain analyses are accurate but scale exponentially in
computation time, making them impractical for large networks. These
computational barriers motivate structural machine learning approaches like
GNNs for scalable throughput prediction in general network topologies. Yet
off-the-shelf GNNs struggle here: a standard GCN yields 63.94\% normalized mean
absolute error (NMAE) on heterogeneous networks because symmetric normalization
conflates a node's direct interference with higher-order, cascading effects
that pertain to how interference propagates over the network graph.
  Building on these insights, we propose the Decoupled Graph Convolutional
Network (D-GCN), a novel architecture that explicitly separates processing of a
node's own transmission probability from neighbor interference effects. D-GCN
replaces mean aggregation with learnable attention, yielding interpretable,
per-neighbor contribution weights while capturing complex multihop interference
patterns. D-GCN attains 3.3\% NMAE, outperforms strong baselines, remains
tractable even when exact analytical methods become computationally infeasible,
and enables gradient-based network optimization that achieves within 1\% of
theoretical optima.

Abstract: Introduction Accurate prediction of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) is
crucial for understanding cellular functions and advancing drug development.
Existing in-silico methods use direct sequence embeddings from Protein Language
Models (PLMs). Others use Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for 3D protein
structures. This study explores less computationally intensive alternatives. We
introduce a novel framework for downstream PPI prediction through link
prediction. Methods We introduce a two-stage graph representation learning
framework, ProtGram-DirectGCN. First, we developed ProtGram. This approach
models a protein's primary structure as a hierarchy of globally inferred n-gram
graphs. In these graphs, residue transition probabilities define edge weights.
Each edge connects a pair of residues in a directed graph. The probabilities
are aggregated from a large corpus of sequences. Second, we propose DirectGCN,
a custom directed graph convolutional neural network. This model features a
unique convolutional layer. It processes information through separate
path-specific transformations: incoming, outgoing, and undirected. A shared
transformation is also applied. These paths are combined via a learnable gating
mechanism. We apply DirectGCN to ProtGram graphs to learn residue-level
embeddings. These embeddings are pooled via attention to generate protein-level
embeddings for prediction. Results We first established the efficacy of
DirectGCN on standard node classification benchmarks. Its performance matches
established methods on general datasets. The model excels at complex, directed
graphs with dense, heterophilic structures. When applied to PPI prediction, the
full ProtGram-DirectGCN framework delivers robust predictive power. This strong
performance holds even with limited training data.

Abstract: Quantitative trading strategies rely on accurately ranking stocks to identify
profitable investments. Effective portfolio management requires models that can
reliably order future stock returns. Transformer models are promising for
understanding financial time series, but how different training loss functions
affect their ability to rank stocks well is not yet fully understood. Financial
markets are challenging due to their changing nature and complex relationships
between stocks. Standard loss functions, which aim for simple prediction
accuracy, often aren't enough. They don't directly teach models to learn the
correct order of stock returns. While many advanced ranking losses exist from
fields such as information retrieval, there hasn't been a thorough comparison
to see how well they work for ranking financial returns, especially when used
with modern Transformer models for stock selection. This paper addresses this
gap by systematically evaluating a diverse set of advanced loss functions
including pointwise, pairwise, listwise for daily stock return forecasting to
facilitate rank-based portfolio selection on S&P 500 data. We focus on
assessing how each loss function influences the model's ability to discern
profitable relative orderings among assets. Our research contributes a
comprehensive benchmark revealing how different loss functions impact a model's
ability to learn cross-sectional and temporal patterns crucial for portfolio
selection, thereby offering practical guidance for optimizing ranking-based
trading strategies.

Conclusion: 将合并重新定义为生成重构能力强的模型空间而非单一合并模型，RMM方法高效、无需数据且灵活，能显著提升低秩模型合并性能。

Abstract: Model merging aims to combine multiple fine-tuned models into a single set of
weights that performs well across all source tasks. While prior work has shown
that merging can approximate the performance of individual fine-tuned models
for each task, it largely overlooks scenarios where models are compressed into
low-rank representations, either through low-rank adaptation (LoRA) or
post-training singular value decomposition (SVD). We first demonstrate that
applying conventional merging methods to low-rank weights leads to severe
performance degradation in the merged model. Motivated by this phenomenon, we
propose a fundamentally different approach: instead of collapsing all adapters
into one set of weights, we construct a compact basis (e.g., an equivalent of
holding two or more models) from which original task-specific models can be
recovered via linear combination. This reframes merging as generating a
reconstruction-capable model space rather than producing a single merged model.
Crucially, this allows us to ``revert'' to each individual model when needed,
recognizing that no merged model can consistently outperform one specialized
for its task. Building on this insight, we introduce our method, Reversible
Model Merging (RMM), an efficient, data-free, and flexible method that provides
a closed-form solution for selecting the optimal basis of model weights and
task-specific coefficients for linear combination. Extensive experiments across
diverse datasets and model scales demonstrate that RMM consistently outperforms
existing merging approaches, preserving the performance of low-rank compressed
models by a significant margin.

Result: 实验表明OCNOpt在鲁棒性和效率上优于现有方法，同时保持可管理的计算复杂度，支持层间反馈策略、博弈论应用和连续时间模型的高阶训练。

Conclusion: OCNOpt为基于动态系统和最优控制理论的原则性算法设计开辟了新途径，展示了将控制理论应用于神经网络优化的潜力。

Abstract: Optimization of deep neural networks (DNNs) has been a driving force in the
advancement of modern machine learning and artificial intelligence. With DNNs
characterized by a prolonged sequence of nonlinear propagation, determining
their optimal parameters given an objective naturally fits within the framework
of Optimal Control Programming. Such an interpretation of DNNs as dynamical
systems has proven crucial in offering a theoretical foundation for principled
analysis from numerical equations to physics. In parallel to these theoretical
pursuits, this paper focuses on an algorithmic perspective. Our motivated
observation is the striking algorithmic resemblance between the Backpropagation
algorithm for computing gradients in DNNs and the optimality conditions for
dynamical systems, expressed through another backward process known as dynamic
programming. Consolidating this connection, where Backpropagation admits a
variational structure, solving an approximate dynamic programming up to the
first-order expansion leads to a new class of optimization methods exploring
higher-order expansions of the Bellman equation. The resulting optimizer,
termed Optimal Control Theoretic Neural Optimizer (OCNOpt), enables rich
algorithmic opportunities, including layer-wise feedback policies,
game-theoretic applications, and higher-order training of continuous-time
models such as Neural ODEs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OCNOpt
improves upon existing methods in robustness and efficiency while maintaining
manageable computational complexity, paving new avenues for principled
algorithmic design grounded in dynamical systems and optimal control theory.

*Mahmood Hegazy,Aaron Rodrigues,Azzam Naeem*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MAFA是一个生产部署的多智能体标注框架，通过可配置的多智能体协作解决金融服务中的大规模标注积压问题，在摩根大通成功处理了100万条用户话语积压，平均与人工标注者达到86%的一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决金融服务中数百万客户话语需要准确分类的标注积压问题，传统标注方法效率低下且成本高昂。

Method: 结合专门化智能体、结构化推理和基于评判者的共识机制，支持通过配置而非代码更改来定义自定义标注类型，实现动态任务适应。

Result: 消除了100万条话语积压，平均与人工标注者86%一致性，每年节省5000多小时人工标注工作，在内部意图分类数据集上比传统方法Top-1准确率提高13.8%，Top-5准确率提高15.1%，F1分数提高16.9%。

Conclusion: 弥合了理论多智能体系统与实际企业部署之间的差距，为面临类似标注挑战的组织提供了蓝图。

Abstract: We present MAFA (Multi-Agent Framework for Annotation), a production-deployed
system that transforms enterprise-scale annotation workflows through
configurable multi-agent collaboration. Addressing the critical challenge of
annotation backlogs in financial services, where millions of customer
utterances require accurate categorization, MAFA combines specialized agents
with structured reasoning and a judge-based consensus mechanism. Our framework
uniquely supports dynamic task adaptation, allowing organizations to define
custom annotation types (FAQs, intents, entities, or domain-specific
categories) through configuration rather than code changes. Deployed at JP
Morgan Chase, MAFA has eliminated a 1 million utterance backlog while
achieving, on average, 86% agreement with human annotators, annually saving
over 5,000 hours of manual annotation work. The system processes utterances
with annotation confidence classifications, which are typically 85% high, 10%
medium, and 5% low across all datasets we tested. This enables human annotators
to focus exclusively on ambiguous and low-coverage cases. We demonstrate MAFA's
effectiveness across multiple datasets and languages, showing consistent
improvements over traditional and single-agent annotation baselines: 13.8%
higher Top-1 accuracy, 15.1% improvement in Top-5 accuracy, and 16.9% better F1
in our internal intent classification dataset and similar gains on public
benchmarks. This work bridges the gap between theoretical multi-agent systems
and practical enterprise deployment, providing a blueprint for organizations
facing similar annotation challenges.

TL;DR: ConDA框架通过对比学习在扩散嵌入中组织潜在空间，使潜在几何与系统动态对齐，支持非线性轨迹遍历以实现可控生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型擅长生成，但其潜在空间未明确组织以实现可解释控制。受对比学习能恢复更解耦和结构化表示的启发，需要组织扩散潜在空间以反映底层动态因素。

Method: 在扩散嵌入中应用对比学习，对齐潜在几何与系统动态，组织潜在空间使遍历方向反映动态因素，支持非线性轨迹遍历。

Result: 在流体动力学、神经钙成像、治疗性神经刺激和面部表情等基准测试中，ConDA产生可解释的潜在表示，相比线性遍历和基于条件的基线方法具有更好的可控性。

Conclusion: 扩散潜在编码包含动态相关结构，但利用此结构需要潜在组织并沿着潜在流形进行遍历。

Abstract: Diffusion models excel at generation, but their latent spaces are not
explicitly organized for interpretable control. We introduce ConDA (Contrastive
Diffusion Alignment), a framework that applies contrastive learning within
diffusion embeddings to align latent geometry with system dynamics. Motivated
by recent advances showing that contrastive objectives can recover more
disentangled and structured representations, ConDA organizes diffusion latents
such that traversal directions reflect underlying dynamical factors. Within
this contrastively structured space, ConDA enables nonlinear trajectory
traversal that supports faithful interpolation, extrapolation, and controllable
generation. Across benchmarks in fluid dynamics, neural calcium imaging,
therapeutic neurostimulation, and facial expression, ConDA produces
interpretable latent representations with improved controllability compared to
linear traversals and conditioning-based baselines. These results suggest that
diffusion latents encode dynamics-relevant structure, but exploiting this
structure requires latent organization and traversal along the latent manifold.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习虽然能保护数据隐私，但面临参与困境问题——参与方不愿贡献资源或可能搭便车，这限制了其实际适应性。

Method: 应用经济学和博弈论概念，结合区块链和深度强化学习等技术解决方案，构建了基于集中式和去中心化架构的激励机制分类法。

Result: 研究表明精心设计的激励机制是联邦学习实际成功的关键要素，而非可选功能。

Conclusion: 虽然已有有前景的解决方案出现，但在构建真正可持续、公平和稳健的联邦学习生态系统方面仍面临重大挑战。

Abstract: Federated learning promises to revolutionize machine learning by enabling
collaborative model training without compromising data privacy. However,
practical adaptability can be limited by critical factors, such as the
participation dilemma. Participating entities are often unwilling to contribute
to a learning system unless they receive some benefits, or they may pretend to
participate and free-ride on others. This chapter identifies the fundamental
challenges in designing incentive mechanisms for federated learning systems. It
examines how foundational concepts from economics and game theory can be
applied to federated learning, alongside technology-driven solutions such as
blockchain and deep reinforcement learning. This work presents a comprehensive
taxonomy that thoroughly covers both centralized and decentralized
architectures based on the aforementioned theoretical concepts. Furthermore,
the concepts described are presented from an application perspective, covering
emerging industrial applications, including healthcare, smart infrastructure,
vehicular networks, and blockchain-based decentralized systems. Through this
exploration, this chapter demonstrates that well-designed incentive mechanisms
are not merely optional features but essential components for the practical
success of federated learning. This analysis reveals both the promising
solutions that have emerged and the significant challenges that remain in
building truly sustainable, fair, and robust federated learning ecosystems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 对分子核的首次全面光谱分析表明，更丰富的光谱特征并不总是提高预测精度，甚至可能对性能产生负面影响。领先特征值（前2%）即可恢复大部分性能，挑战了"更丰富光谱带来更好泛化"的常见启发式方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然深度模型在分子性质预测中达到最先进精度，但核方法因其在低数据环境下的鲁棒性和透明理论基础仍被广泛使用。然而，分子核的系统光谱分析研究稀缺，需要理解核的光谱特性与泛化能力之间的关系。

Method: 在QM9数据集上对分子指纹、预训练transformer、全局和局部3D表示等七种分子性质进行核岭回归的全面光谱分析，使用四种不同光谱指标，并通过截断核和皮尔逊相关性测试探究光谱与性能关系。

Result: 更丰富的光谱特征并不一致提高精度；对于transformer和局部3D表示，光谱丰富度与性能呈负相关；保留前2%特征值即可恢复几乎所有性能，表明领先特征值捕获了最具信息量的特征。

Conclusion: 研究结果挑战了"更丰富光谱带来更好泛化"的常见启发式，揭示了表示、核特征与预测性能之间的微妙关系，为数据受限的科学和实际任务中核与自监督学习方法评估提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Understanding the spectral properties of kernels offers a principled
perspective on generalization and representation quality. While deep models
achieve state-of-the-art accuracy in molecular property prediction, kernel
methods remain widely used for their robustness in low-data regimes and
transparent theoretical grounding. Despite extensive studies of kernel spectra
in machine learning, systematic spectral analyses of molecular kernels are
scarce. In this work, we provide the first comprehensive spectral analysis of
kernel ridge regression on the QM9 dataset, molecular fingerprint, pretrained
transformer-based, global and local 3D representations across seven molecular
properties. Surprisingly, richer spectral features, measured by four different
spectral metrics, do not consistently improve accuracy. Pearson correlation
tests further reveal that for transformer-based and local 3D representations,
spectral richness can even have a negative correlation with performance. We
also implement truncated kernels to probe the relationship between spectrum and
predictive performance: in many kernels, retaining only the top 2% of
eigenvalues recovers nearly all performance, indicating that the leading
eigenvalues capture the most informative features. Our results challenge the
common heuristic that "richer spectra yield better generalization" and
highlight nuanced relationships between representation, kernel features, and
predictive performance. Beyond molecular property prediction, these findings
inform how kernel and self-supervised learning methods are evaluated in
data-limited scientific and real-world tasks.

*Nils Philipp Walter,Linara Adilova,Jilles Vreeken,Michael Kamp*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文揭示了平坦极小值与对抗鲁棒性的复杂关系：平坦性仅能保证局部鲁棒性，而非全局鲁棒性。研究发现对抗样本常位于模型自信但错误的平坦区域。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管神经网络经验上成功，但仍易受微小对抗扰动影响。长期假设认为平坦极小值（损失景观中低曲率区域）能提供更强鲁棒性，但这一联系缺乏严格形式化分析。

Method: 首先推导了倒数第二层相对平坦度的闭式表达式，利用此约束损失在输入空间中的变化，从而形式化分析整个网络的对抗鲁棒性。通过理论和实验验证，探索了控制对抗脆弱性的几何结构。

Result: 平坦性仅能保证局部邻域内的对抗鲁棒性，而要维持更大范围的鲁棒性，损失需要在数据流形外急剧弯曲。实验验证了理论预测，发现对抗样本常位于模型自信但错误的平坦区域。

Conclusion: 研究挑战了对平坦性的简化理解，提供了关于其在鲁棒性中作用的细致认识：平坦性仅提供局部保护，全局鲁棒性需要损失在数据流形外快速变化。

Abstract: Despite their empirical success, neural networks remain vulnerable to small,
adversarial perturbations. A longstanding hypothesis suggests that flat minima,
regions of low curvature in the loss landscape, offer increased robustness.
While intuitive, this connection has remained largely informal and incomplete.
By rigorously formalizing the relationship, we show this intuition is only
partially correct: flatness implies local but not global adversarial
robustness. To arrive at this result, we first derive a closed-form expression
for relative flatness in the penultimate layer, and then show we can use this
to constrain the variation of the loss in input space. This allows us to
formally analyze the adversarial robustness of the entire network. We then show
that to maintain robustness beyond a local neighborhood, the loss needs to
curve sharply away from the data manifold. We validate our theoretical
predictions empirically across architectures and datasets, uncovering the
geometric structure that governs adversarial vulnerability, and linking
flatness to model confidence: adversarial examples often lie in large, flat
regions where the model is confidently wrong. Our results challenge simplified
views of flatness and provide a nuanced understanding of its role in
robustness.

Motivation: 竞争性编程已成为评估大语言模型推理和问题解决能力的重要基准，但开源模型在IOI等顶级竞赛中达到金牌水平仍具挑战性，而专有模型的方法往往不公开。

Method: 结合大规模生成、行为聚类、排名和轮询提交策略，在有限验证预算下高效探索多样化解空间。

Conclusion: 该方法为LLM推理能力的透明和可复现评估设立了新基准，证明了开源模型在顶级编程竞赛中可以达到人类金牌水平。

Abstract: Competitive programming has become a rigorous benchmark for evaluating the
reasoning and problem-solving capabilities of large language models (LLMs). The
International Olympiad in Informatics (IOI) stands out as one of the most
prestigious annual competitions in competitive programming and has become a key
benchmark for comparing human and AI-level programming ability. While several
proprietary models have been claimed to achieve gold medal-level performance at
the IOI, often with undisclosed methods, achieving comparable results with
open-weight models remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we present
\gencluster, a scalable and reproducible test-time compute framework that
attains IOI gold-level performance using open-weight models. It combines
large-scale generation, behavioral clustering, ranking, and a round-robin
submission strategy to efficiently explore diverse solution spaces under
limited validation budgets. Our experiments show that the performance of our
proposed approach scales consistently with available compute, narrowing the gap
between open and closed systems. Notably, we will show that GenCluster can
achieve a gold medal at IOI 2025 for the first time with an open-weight model
gpt-oss-120b, setting a new benchmark for transparent and reproducible
evaluation of reasoning in LLMs.

Conclusion: DR-RPO算法成功地将策略优化方法扩展到鲁棒RL领域，在理论和实证上都表现出色，为解决分布偏移下的决策问题提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Decision-making under distribution shift is a central challenge in
reinforcement learning (RL), where training and deployment environments differ.
We study this problem through the lens of robust Markov decision processes
(RMDPs), which optimize performance against adversarial transition dynamics.
Our focus is the online setting, where the agent has only limited interaction
with the environment, making sample efficiency and exploration especially
critical. Policy optimization, despite its success in standard RL, remains
theoretically and empirically underexplored in robust RL. To bridge this gap,
we propose \textbf{D}istributionally \textbf{R}obust \textbf{R}egularized
\textbf{P}olicy \textbf{O}ptimization algorithm (DR-RPO), a model-free online
policy optimization method that learns robust policies with sublinear regret.
To enable tractable optimization within the softmax policy class, DR-RPO
incorporates reference-policy regularization, yielding RMDP variants that are
doubly constrained in both transitions and policies. To scale to large
state-action spaces, we adopt the $d$-rectangular linear MDP formulation and
combine linear function approximation with an upper confidence bonus for
optimistic exploration. We provide theoretical guarantees showing that policy
optimization can achieve polynomial suboptimality bounds and sample efficiency
in robust RL, matching the performance of value-based approaches. Finally,
empirical results across diverse domains corroborate our theory and demonstrate
the robustness of DR-RPO.

Method: 使用衰减双向自注意力模块模拟自然衰减现象，相位差引导双向交叉注意力模块捕捉波与结构的双向相互作用和相位关系，通过全局上下文融合模块整合双流信息，并采用混合时频损失函数进行训练。

Conclusion: PhysAttnNet作为海洋工程中复杂系统预测模型的开发框架具有重要潜力，能够有效提升弹性布拉格防波堤运动响应预测的准确性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Accurate motion response prediction for elastic Bragg breakwaters is critical
for their structural safety and operational integrity in marine environments.
However, conventional deep learning models often exhibit limited generalization
capabilities when presented with unseen sea states. These deficiencies stem
from the neglect of natural decay observed in marine systems and inadequate
modeling of wave-structure interaction (WSI). To overcome these challenges,
this study proposes a novel Physics Prior-Guided Dual-Stream Attention Network
(PhysAttnNet). First, the decay bidirectional self-attention (DBSA) module
incorporates a learnable temporal decay to assign higher weights to recent
states, aiming to emulate the natural decay phenomenon. Meanwhile, the phase
differences guided bidirectional cross-attention (PDG-BCA) module explicitly
captures the bidirectional interaction and phase relationship between waves and
the structure using a cosine-based bias within a bidirectional
cross-computation paradigm. These streams are synergistically integrated
through a global context fusion (GCF) module. Finally, PhysAttnNet is trained
with a hybrid time-frequency loss that jointly minimizes time-domain prediction
errors and frequency-domain spectral discrepancies. Comprehensive experiments
on wave flume datasets demonstrate that PhysAttnNet significantly outperforms
mainstream models. Furthermore,cross-scenario generalization tests validate the
model's robustness and adaptability to unseen environments, highlighting its
potential as a framework to develop predictive models for complex systems in
ocean engineering.

Motivation: 随着基础模型在时间序列分析中日益受到关注，特别是在生理传感领域，需要比较通用型和专用型模型的实际表现，以指导模型选择和应用。

Method: 通过51个任务（包括心脏状态评估、实验室值估计和跨模态推理）的测试套件，从7个维度（胜率、平均性能、特征质量、调优增益、性能方差、可迁移性和可扩展性）全面评估两种模型。

Conclusion: 专用模型在PPG信号分析任务中表现更优，研究还提供了关于泛化性、公平性、注意力可视化和训练数据选择重要性的深入分析。

Abstract: Foundation models are large-scale machine learning models that are
pre-trained on massive amounts of data and can be adapted for various
downstream tasks. They have been extensively applied to tasks in Natural
Language Processing and Computer Vision with models such as GPT, BERT, and
CLIP. They are now also increasingly gaining attention in time-series analysis,
particularly for physiological sensing. However, most time series foundation
models are specialist models - with data in pre-training and testing of the
same type, such as Electrocardiogram, Electroencephalogram, and
Photoplethysmogram (PPG). Recent works, such as MOMENT, train a generalist time
series foundation model with data from multiple domains, such as weather,
traffic, and electricity. This paper aims to conduct a comprehensive
benchmarking study to compare the performance of generalist and specialist
models, with a focus on PPG signals. Through an extensive suite of total 51
tasks covering cardiac state assessment, laboratory value estimation, and
cross-modal inference, we comprehensively evaluate both models across seven
dimensions, including win score, average performance, feature quality, tuning
gain, performance variance, transferability, and scalability. These metrics
jointly capture not only the models' capability but also their adaptability,
robustness, and efficiency under different fine-tuning strategies, providing a
holistic understanding of their strengths and limitations for diverse
downstream scenarios. In a full-tuning scenario, we demonstrate that the
specialist model achieves a 27% higher win score. Finally, we provide further
analysis on generalization, fairness, attention visualizations, and the
importance of training data choice.

Conclusion: CAST提供了一种补充现有方法的分析视角，通过直接矩阵估计和光谱分析揭示了Transformer层的功能特性和行为模式。

Abstract: Large language models have achieved remarkable success but remain largely
black boxes with poorly understood internal mechanisms. To address this
limitation, many researchers have proposed various interpretability methods
including mechanistic analysis, probing classifiers, and activation
visualization, each providing valuable insights from different perspectives.
Building upon this rich landscape of complementary approaches, we introduce
CAST (Compositional Analysis via Spectral Tracking), a probe-free framework
that contributes a novel perspective by analyzing transformer layer functions
through direct transformation matrix estimation and comprehensive spectral
analysis. CAST offers complementary insights to existing methods by estimating
the realized transformation matrices for each layer using Moore-Penrose
pseudoinverse and applying spectral analysis with six interpretable metrics
characterizing layer behavior. Our analysis reveals distinct behaviors between
encoder-only and decoder-only models, with decoder models exhibiting
compression-expansion cycles while encoder models maintain consistent high-rank
processing. Kernel analysis further demonstrates functional relationship
patterns between layers, with CKA similarity matrices clearly partitioning
layers into three phases: feature extraction, compression, and specialization.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于数据而非梯度的非参数化归因方法，通过图像块级相似度衡量训练样本对生成模型输出的影响，无需模型梯度或重新训练，在保持计算效率的同时实现可解释的空间归因。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散模型归因方法通常需要模型梯度或重新训练，这在专有或大规模设置中应用受限，因此需要开发不依赖模型内部信息的归因方法。

Method: 基于最优评分函数的解析形式，通过计算生成图像与训练图像之间的块级相似度来测量影响，支持多尺度表示，并通过基于卷积的加速保持计算效率。

Result: 实验表明该方法实现了强大的归因性能，与基于梯度的方法接近，并显著优于现有非参数基线方法。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种不依赖特定模型的可解释归因框架，能够揭示训练数据与输出之间的内在关系，在专有和大规模场景中具有广泛应用前景。

Abstract: Data attribution for generative models seeks to quantify the influence of
individual training examples on model outputs. Existing methods for diffusion
models typically require access to model gradients or retraining, limiting
their applicability in proprietary or large-scale settings. We propose a
nonparametric attribution method that operates entirely on data, measuring
influence via patch-level similarity between generated and training images. Our
approach is grounded in the analytical form of the optimal score function and
naturally extends to multiscale representations, while remaining
computationally efficient through convolution-based acceleration. In addition
to producing spatially interpretable attributions, our framework uncovers
patterns that reflect intrinsic relationships between training data and
outputs, independent of any specific model. Experiments demonstrate that our
method achieves strong attribution performance, closely matching gradient-based
approaches and substantially outperforming existing nonparametric baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前早期事件预测系统忽略了风险评分的时间稳定性，且主要基于表格数据评估，缺乏对多模态输入下风险轨迹行为的测试。

Method: 提出CAREBench基准，使用多模态输入（表格EHR、ECG波形、临床文本），引入基于局部Lipschitz常数的稳定性指标来量化短期风险变异性。

Result: 在六个预测任务中，现有方法特别是LLMs难以同时优化准确性和稳定性，在高精度操作点召回率表现差。

Conclusion: 需要开发能够产生证据对齐、稳定轨迹的模型，以在连续监测环境中赢得临床医生的信任。

Abstract: Early event prediction (EEP) systems continuously estimate a patient's
imminent risk to support clinical decision-making. For bedside trust, risk
trajectories must be accurate and temporally stable, shifting only with new,
relevant evidence. However, current benchmarks (a) ignore stability of risk
scores and (b) evaluate mainly on tabular inputs, leaving trajectory behavior
untested. To address this gap, we introduce CAREBench, an EEP benchmark that
evaluates deployability using multi-modal inputs-tabular EHR, ECG waveforms,
and clinical text-and assesses temporal stability alongside predictive
accuracy. We propose a stability metric that quantifies short-term variability
in per-patient risk and penalizes abrupt oscillations based on local-Lipschitz
constants. CAREBench spans six prediction tasks such as sepsis onset and
compares classical learners, deep sequence models, and zero-shot LLMs. Across
tasks, existing methods, especially LLMs, struggle to jointly optimize accuracy
and stability, with notably poor recall at high-precision operating points.
These results highlight the need for models that produce evidence-aligned,
stable trajectories to earn clinician trust in continuous monitoring settings.

Conclusion: SR-RC为在边缘AI中部署储层计算进行时间序列异常检测提供了实用方向，结合了谱残差方法的硬件友好特性。

Abstract: Reservoir computing (RC) establishes the basis for the processing of
time-series data by exploiting the high-dimensional spatiotemporal response of
a recurrent neural network to an input signal. In particular, RC trains only
the output layer weights. This simplicity has drawn attention especially in
Edge Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications. Edge AI enables time-series
anomaly detection in real time, which is important because detection delays can
lead to serious incidents. However, achieving adequate anomaly-detection
performance with RC alone may require an unacceptably large reservoir on
resource-constrained edge devices. Without enlarging the reservoir, attention
mechanisms can improve accuracy, although they may require substantial
computation and undermine the learning efficiency of RC. In this study, to
improve the anomaly detection performance of RC without sacrificing learning
efficiency, we propose a spectral residual RC (SR-RC) that integrates the
spectral residual (SR) method - a learning-free, bottom-up attention mechanism
- with RC. We demonstrated that SR-RC outperformed conventional RC and
logistic-regression models based on values extracted by the SR method across
benchmark tasks and real-world time-series datasets. Moreover, because the SR
method, similarly to RC, is well suited for hardware implementation, SR-RC
suggests a practical direction for deploying RC as Edge AI for time-series
anomaly detection.

*Nam Le,Leo Yu Zhang,Kewen Liao,Shirui Pan,Wei Luo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TED++是一个子流形感知的框架，用于检测逃避现有防御的隐蔽后门攻击。它通过构建围绕每个类隐藏特征流形的管状邻域，并使用局部自适应排名来检测偏离可接受管的激活，从而在自适应攻击和有限数据场景下实现最先进的检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着深度神经网络在关键应用中日益重要，隐蔽的后门攻击（中毒训练输入触发恶意模型行为但看起来良性）构成了严重的安全风险。现有防御在面对攻击者利用微妙距离异常或干净样本稀缺时容易失效。

Method: TED++首先围绕每个类的隐藏特征流形构建管状邻域，从少量干净激活中估计其局部“厚度”。然后应用局部自适应排名(LAR)来检测任何偏离可接受管的激活。通过在所有层上聚合这些LAR调整的排名，TED++捕获输入在演化类子流形上的忠实程度。

Result: 在基准数据集和任务上的广泛实验表明，TED++在自适应攻击和有限数据场景下实现了最先进的检测性能。即使每个类只有五个保留样本，TED++仍能实现近乎完美的检测，在AUROC上比次优方法提高了14%。

Conclusion: TED++通过子流形感知的方法有效检测隐蔽后门攻击，在数据稀缺和自适应攻击场景下表现出色，为深度神经网络安全提供了强大的防御解决方案。

Abstract: As deep neural networks power increasingly critical applications, stealthy
backdoor attacks, where poisoned training inputs trigger malicious model
behaviour while appearing benign, pose a severe security risk. Many existing
defences are vulnerable when attackers exploit subtle distance-based anomalies
or when clean examples are scarce. To meet this challenge, we introduce TED++,
a submanifold-aware framework that effectively detects subtle backdoors that
evade existing defences. TED++ begins by constructing a tubular neighbourhood
around each class's hidden-feature manifold, estimating its local ``thickness''
from a handful of clean activations. It then applies Locally Adaptive Ranking
(LAR) to detect any activation that drifts outside the admissible tube. By
aggregating these LAR-adjusted ranks across all layers, TED++ captures how
faithfully an input remains on the evolving class submanifolds. Based on such
characteristic ``tube-constrained'' behaviour, TED++ flags inputs whose
LAR-based ranking sequences deviate significantly. Extensive experiments are
conducted on benchmark datasets and tasks, demonstrating that TED++ achieves
state-of-the-art detection performance under both adaptive-attack and
limited-data scenarios. Remarkably, even with only five held-out examples per
class, TED++ still delivers near-perfect detection, achieving gains of up to
14\% in AUROC over the next-best method. The code is publicly available at
https://github.com/namle-w/TEDpp.

TL;DR: 提出了主动可观测马尔可夫决策过程(AOMDP)，智能体不仅选择控制动作，还决定是否测量潜在状态。测量会揭示真实状态但可能有负面延迟影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在强化学习中测量状态可能成本高昂且对结果产生负面影响，需要平衡状态观测与成本的关系。

Method: 将AOMDP建模为周期性部分可观测MDP，提出基于信念状态的在线RL算法，使用顺序蒙特卡洛方法近似未知静态参数和未观测状态的联合后验。

Result: 在数字健康应用中评估算法，智能体决定何时提供数字干预和何时通过调查评估用户健康状况。

Conclusion: 尽管测量有成本，但减少的不确定性可以证明提高样本效率并增加最优策略的价值。

Abstract: Measuring states in reinforcement learning (RL) can be costly in real-world
settings and may negatively influence future outcomes. We introduce the
Actively Observable Markov Decision Process (AOMDP), where an agent not only
selects control actions but also decides whether to measure the latent state.
The measurement action reveals the true latent state but may have a negative
delayed effect on the environment. We show that this reduced uncertainty may
provably improve sample efficiency and increase the value of the optimal policy
despite these costs. We formulate an AOMDP as a periodic partially observable
MDP and propose an online RL algorithm based on belief states. To approximate
the belief states, we further propose a sequential Monte Carlo method to
jointly approximate the posterior of unknown static environment parameters and
unobserved latent states. We evaluate the proposed algorithm in a digital
health application, where the agent decides when to deliver digital
interventions and when to assess users' health status through surveys.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LLM-ERM：一种结合LLM引导搜索和ERM验证的程序学习框架，在样本效率和计算可行性上优于传统方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决程序学习中样本效率与计算可行性之间的权衡问题。传统方法要么搜索成本高，要么需要大量样本

Method: 提出LLM-ERM框架：使用预训练LLM生成候选程序，在保留数据上编译验证并选择最佳假设，无需梯度或反馈

Result: 在奇偶性变体、模式匹配和素数测试等任务上，仅需200个样本即可解决，而SGD训练的transformer即使有100,000样本也会过拟合

Conclusion: 语言引导的程序合成在保持计算可行性的同时恢复了有限类ERM的统计效率，为学习简洁假设提供了实用途径

Abstract: We seek algorithms for program learning that are both sample-efficient and
computationally feasible. Classical results show that targets admitting short
program descriptions (e.g., with short ``python code'') can be learned with a
``small'' number of examples (scaling with the size of the code) via
length-first program enumeration, but the search is exponential in description
length. Consequently, Gradient-based training avoids this cost yet can require
exponentially many samples on certain short-program families.
  To address this gap, we introduce LLM-ERM, a propose-and-verify framework
that replaces exhaustive enumeration with an LLM-guided search over candidate
programs while retaining ERM-style selection on held-out data. Specifically, we
draw $k$ candidates with a pretrained reasoning-augmented LLM, compile and
check each on the data, and return the best verified hypothesis, with no
feedback, adaptivity, or gradients. Theoretically, we show that coordinate-wise
online mini-batch SGD requires many samples to learn certain short programs.
{\em Empirically, LLM-ERM solves tasks such as parity variants, pattern
matching, and primality testing with as few as 200 samples, while SGD-trained
transformers overfit even with 100,000 samples}. These results indicate that
language-guided program synthesis recovers much of the statistical efficiency
of finite-class ERM while remaining computationally tractable, offering a
practical route to learning succinct hypotheses beyond the reach of
gradient-based training.

TL;DR: 提出DARTS-GT方法，通过不对称注意力机制和解耦结构编码与特征表示，在Transformer注意力内部实现深度异构的GNN算子选择，同时开发了首个图Transformer定量可解释性框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前图Transformer存在设计僵化、缺乏量化可解释性的问题，固定GNN类型限制了深度特定组件选择的潜力，复杂架构的增益来源难以区分有意义模式与虚假相关性。

Method: 通过不对称注意力设计解耦结构编码与特征表示，使用DARTS在每层选择最优GNN算子，实现Transformer注意力内部的深度异构，并开发基于因果消融的定量可解释性框架。

Result: 在8个基准测试中，DARTS-GT在4个数据集上达到最先进水平，其余保持竞争力，发现的架构揭示了数据集特定模式，且异构架构比基线产生更可解释的模型。

Conclusion: 图Transformer无需在性能与可解释性之间做选择，DARTS-GT通过深度异构架构和定量可解释性框架，同时实现了高性能和高可解释性。

Abstract: Graph Transformers (GTs) have emerged as powerful architectures for
graph-structured data, yet remain constrained by rigid designs and lack
quantifiable interpretability. Current state-of-the-art GTs commit to fixed GNN
types across all layers, missing potential benefits of depth-specific component
selection, while their complex architectures become opaque where performance
gains cannot be distinguished between meaningful patterns and spurious
correlations. We redesign GT attention through asymmetry, decoupling structural
encoding from feature representation: queries derive from node features while
keys and values come from GNN transformations. Within this framework, we use
Differentiable ARchiTecture Search (DARTS) to select optimal GNN operators at
each layer, enabling depth-wise heterogeneity inside transformer attention
itself (DARTS-GT). To understand discovered architectures, we develop the first
quantitative interpretability framework for GTs through causal ablation. Our
metrics (Head-deviation, Specialization, and Focus), identify which heads and
nodes drive predictions while enabling model comparison. Experiments across
eight benchmarks show DARTS-GT achieves state-of-the-art on four datasets while
remaining competitive on others, with discovered architectures revealing
dataset-specific patterns. Our interpretability analysis reveals that visual
attention salience and causal importance do not always correlate, indicating
widely used visualization approaches may miss components that actually matter.
Crucially, heterogeneous architectures found by DARTS-GT consistently produced
more interpretable models than baselines, establishing that Graph Transformers
need not choose between performance and interpretability.

TL;DR: 提出Stop-RAG方法，通过基于价值的控制器自适应决定何时停止检索，解决迭代RAG系统中固定迭代次数或置信度代理方法的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 迭代RAG系统每增加一个循环都会增加延迟、成本和引入干扰证据的风险，需要高效的停止策略。现有方法要么使用预定迭代次数，要么依赖不能很好反映是否需要更多检索的置信度代理。

Method: 将迭代RAG建模为有限时域马尔可夫决策过程，引入基于价值的控制器Stop-RAG，使用完整轨迹的全宽度前向Q(λ)目标进行训练，兼容黑盒API和现有流水线。

Result: 在多跳问答基准测试中，Stop-RAG始终优于固定迭代基线和基于提示的LLM停止方法。

Conclusion: 自适应停止是当前代理系统中的关键缺失组件，基于价值的控制可以提升RAG系统的准确性。

Abstract: Iterative retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enables large language models
to answer complex multi-hop questions, but each additional loop increases
latency, costs, and the risk of introducing distracting evidence, motivating
the need for an efficient stopping strategy. Existing methods either use a
predetermined number of iterations or rely on confidence proxies that poorly
reflect whether more retrieval will actually help. We cast iterative RAG as a
finite-horizon Markov decision process and introduce Stop-RAG, a value-based
controller that adaptively decides when to stop retrieving. Trained with
full-width forward-view Q($\lambda$) targets from complete trajectories,
Stop-RAG learns effective stopping policies while remaining compatible with
black-box APIs and existing pipelines. On multi-hop question-answering
benchmarks, Stop-RAG consistently outperforms both fixed-iteration baselines
and prompting-based stopping with LLMs. These results highlight adaptive
stopping as a key missing component in current agentic systems, and demonstrate
that value-based control can improve the accuracy of RAG systems.

Motivation: 从微分几何角度重新解释自动微分理论，为深度学习和科学计算中开发结构保持的微分方法提供理论基础。

Method: 使用jet bundles和Weil代数的几何框架，将反向模式AD建模为余切拉回，泰勒模式作为Weil代数求值，并利用张量化Weil代数实现混合导数的一步计算。

Result: 获得了反向模式的函子恒等式、高阶导数的代数精确性、截断误差的显式界限，以及避免组合爆炸的线性成本混合导数计算。

Conclusion: 该框架通过微分几何视角解释AD理论，为开发结构保持的微分方法奠定了基础，在深度学习和科学计算中具有应用前景。

Abstract: We present a geometric formulation of automatic differentiation (AD) using
jet bundles and Weil algebras. Reverse-mode AD emerges as cotangent-pullback,
while Taylor-mode corresponds to evaluation in a Weil algebra. From these
principles, we derive concise statements on correctness, stability, and
complexity: a functorial identity for reverse-mode, algebraic exactness of
higher-order derivatives, and explicit bounds on truncation error. We further
show that tensorized Weil algebras permit one-pass computation of all mixed
derivatives with cost linear in the algebra dimension, avoiding the
combinatorial blow-up of nested JVP/VJP schedules. This framework interprets AD
theory through the lens of differential geometry and offers a foundation for
developing structure-preserving differentiation methods in deep learning and
scientific computing. Code and examples are available at

TL;DR: 该论文首次系统分析了基于LLM的提示优化中的投毒风险，发现反馈操纵攻击比查询注入攻击更危险，提出了无需奖励模型访问的简单假奖励攻击，并设计了高亮防御方法有效降低攻击成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM系统在日常AI应用中广泛使用，其性能依赖于精心设计的提示。基于LLM的提示优化器通过迭代优化提示来减少人工工作量，但这一优化阶段的安全性尚未得到充分研究。

Method: 使用HarmBench进行系统性分析，比较反馈操纵攻击与查询注入攻击的效果。提出了一种简单的假奖励攻击方法，该方法不需要访问奖励模型。同时设计了一种轻量级的高亮防御机制。

Result: 研究发现系统对操纵反馈的脆弱性显著高于注入查询：反馈攻击使攻击成功率提升高达ΔASR=0.48。假奖励攻击显著增加系统脆弱性，而高亮防御能将假奖励攻击的ΔASR从0.23降低到0.07，且不影响系统效用。

Conclusion: 提示优化管道应被视为一级攻击面，需要加强对反馈通道和优化框架的安全防护措施。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) systems now underpin everyday AI applications such
as chatbots, computer-use assistants, and autonomous robots, where performance
often depends on carefully designed prompts. LLM-based prompt optimizers reduce
that effort by iteratively refining prompts from scored feedback, yet the
security of this optimization stage remains underexamined. We present the first
systematic analysis of poisoning risks in LLM-based prompt optimization. Using
HarmBench, we find systems are substantially more vulnerable to manipulated
feedback than to injected queries: feedback-based attacks raise attack success
rate (ASR) by up to $\Delta$ASR = 0.48. We introduce a simple fake-reward
attack that requires no access to the reward model and significantly increases
vulnerability, and we propose a lightweight highlighting defense that reduces
the fake-reward $\Delta$ASR from 0.23 to 0.07 without degrading utility. These
results establish prompt optimization pipelines as a first-class attack surface
and motivate stronger safeguards for feedback channels and optimization
frameworks.

TL;DR: 本文提出了交互一致性指数(IC-index)来评估药物-靶点亲和力预测中交互方向的准确性，揭示了机器学习算法在无法捕捉交互作用时的局限性，并通过实证研究验证了该指标对现有预测性能评估的补充作用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的药物-靶点亲和力(DTA)预测方法主要关注亲和力值的准确性，但忽略了交互作用方向的重要性。正确捕捉交互作用对于药物分配决策至关重要，因为交互作用的存在意味着不同的药物-靶点组合会产生不同的总体效果。

Method: 提出了交互一致性指数(IC-index)来评估预测器对交互作用方向的预测性能。通过理论分析证明了IC-index在无法捕捉交互作用的预测器上的不变性，并展示了当机器学习算法对药物和靶点身份具有置换等变性时，无法在未见样本上捕捉交互作用。

Result: 实验在多个生物医学交互数据集上进行，使用各种最先进的机器学习算法。结果表明不同的亲和力强度预测方法在IC-index上的表现差异，验证了该指标对现有预测性能评估的补充价值。

Conclusion: IC-index为DTA预测提供了重要的补充评估维度，强调了在预测模型中适当整合药物和靶点侧信息的重要性，以克服置换等变性带来的局限性并有效捕捉交互作用。

Abstract: Consider two sets of entities and their members' mutual affinity values, say
drug-target affinities (DTA). Drugs and targets are said to interact in their
effects on DTAs if drug's effect on it depends on the target. Presence of
interaction implies that assigning a drug to a target and another drug to
another target does not provide the same aggregate DTA as the reversed
assignment would provide. Accordingly, correctly capturing interactions enables
better decision-making, for example, in allocation of limited numbers of drug
doses to their best matching targets. Learning to predict DTAs is popularly
done from either solely from known DTAs or together with side information on
the entities, such as chemical structures of drugs and targets. In this paper,
we introduce interaction directions' prediction performance estimator we call
interaction concordance index (IC-index), for both fixed predictors and machine
learning algorithms aimed for inferring them. IC-index complements the
popularly used DTA prediction performance estimators by evaluating the ratio of
correctly predicted directions of interaction effects in data. First, we show
the invariance of IC-index on predictors unable to capture interactions.
Secondly, we show that learning algorithm's permutation equivariance regarding
drug and target identities implies its inability to capture interactions when
either drug, target or both are unseen during training. In practical
applications, this equivariance is remedied via incorporation of appropriate
side information on drugs and targets. We make a comprehensive empirical
evaluation over several biomedical interaction data sets with various
state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms. The experiments demonstrate how
different types of affinity strength prediction methods perform in terms of
IC-index complementing existing prediction performance estimators.

Conclusion: 从专家输出合并的角度分析专家合并过程，并提出基于数学优化的MergeMoE方法，能有效压缩MoE模型且性能优于现有方法。

Abstract: The Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) technique has proven to be a promising solution
to efficiently scale the model size, which has been widely applied in recent
LLM advancements. However, the substantial memory overhead of MoE models has
made their compression an important research direction. In this work, we
provide a theoretical analysis of expert merging, a recently proposed technique
for compressing MoE models. Rather than interpreting expert merging from the
conventional perspective of parameter aggregation, we approach it from the
perspective of merging experts' outputs. Our key insight is that the merging
process can be interpreted as inserting additional matrices into the forward
computation, which naturally leads to an optimization formulation. Building on
this analysis, we introduce MergeMoE, a method that leverages mathematical
optimization to construct the compression matrices. We evaluate MergeMoE on
multiple MoE models and show that our algorithm consistently outperforms the
baselines with the same compression ratios.

Conclusion: 重构步骤对剪枝性能恢复至关重要，简单剪枝标准配合适当重构可超越复杂方法，挑战了避免重训练的传统观点。

Abstract: While Neural Network pruning typically requires retraining the model to
recover pruning-induced performance degradation, state-of-the-art Large
Language Models (LLMs) pruning methods instead solve a layer-wise mask
selection and reconstruction problem on a small set of calibration data to
avoid full retraining, as it is considered computationally infeasible for LLMs.
Reconstructing single matrices in isolation has favorable properties, such as
convexity of the objective and significantly reduced memory requirements
compared to full retraining. In practice, however, reconstruction is often
implemented at coarser granularities, e.g., reconstructing a whole transformer
block against its dense activations instead of a single matrix. In this work,
we study the key design choices when reconstructing or retraining the remaining
weights after pruning. We conduct an extensive computational study on
state-of-the-art GPT architectures, and report several surprising findings that
challenge common intuitions about retraining after pruning. In particular, we
observe a free lunch scenario: reconstructing attention and MLP components
separately within each transformer block is nearly the most resource-efficient
yet achieves the best perplexity. Most importantly, this Pareto-optimal setup
achieves better performance than full retraining, despite requiring only a
fraction of the memory. Furthermore, we demonstrate that simple and efficient
pruning criteria such as Wanda can outperform much more complex approaches when
the reconstruction step is properly executed, highlighting its importance. Our
findings challenge the narrative that retraining should be avoided at all costs
and provide important insights into post-pruning performance recovery for LLMs.

Result: GAN训练稳定，生成的样本能重现沉积物的非平稳性和细节，没有出现模式崩溃或纯粹记忆训练数据的问题，且能遵守叠加定律。

Conclusion: GAN在针对特定地质结构的训练数据集上比通常认为的更稳健，利用地质原理如叠加定律来指导深度生成模型具有很大潜力。

Abstract: The distribution of resources in the subsurface is deeply linked to the
variations of its physical properties. Generative modeling has long been used
to predict those physical properties while quantifying the associated
uncertainty. But current approaches struggle to properly reproduce geological
structures, and fluvial deposits in particular, because of their continuity.
This study explores whether a generative adversarial network (GAN) - a type of
deep-learning algorithm for generative modeling - can be trained to reproduce
fluvial deposits simulated by a process-based model - a more expensive model
that mimics geological processes. An ablation study shows that developments
from the deep-learning community to generate large 2D images are directly
transferable to 3D images of fluvial deposits. Training remains stable, and the
generated samples reproduce the non-stationarity and details of the deposits
without mode collapse or pure memorization of the training data. Using a
process-based model to generate those training data allows us to include
valuable properties other than the usual physical properties. We show how the
deposition time let us monitor and validate the performance of a GAN by
checking that its samples honor the law of superposition. Our work joins a
series of previous studies suggesting that GANs are more robust that given
credit for, at least for training datasets targeting specific geological
structures. Whether this robustness transfers to larger 3D images and
multimodal datasets remains to be seen. Exploring how deep generative models
can leverage geological principles like the law of superposition shows a lot of
promise.

Abstract: Multi-class wine classification presents fundamental trade-offs between model
accuracy, feature dimensionality, and interpretability - critical factors for
production deployment in analytical chemistry. This paper presents a
comprehensive empirical study of One-vs-Rest logistic regression on the UCI
Wine dataset (178 samples, 3 cultivars, 13 chemical features), comparing
from-scratch gradient descent implementation against scikit-learn's optimized
solvers and quantifying L1 regularization effects on feature sparsity. Manual
gradient descent achieves 92.59 percent mean test accuracy with smooth
convergence, validating theoretical foundations, though scikit-learn provides
24x training speedup and 98.15 percent accuracy. Class-specific analysis
reveals distinct chemical signatures with heterogeneous patterns where color
intensity varies dramatically (0.31 to 16.50) across cultivars. L1
regularization produces 54-69 percent feature reduction with only 4.63 percent
accuracy decrease, demonstrating favorable interpretability-performance
trade-offs. We propose an optimal 5-feature subset achieving 62 percent
complexity reduction with estimated 92-94 percent accuracy, enabling
cost-effective deployment with 80 dollars savings per sample and 56 percent
time reduction. Statistical validation confirms robust generalization with
sub-2ms prediction latency suitable for real-time quality control. Our findings
provide actionable guidelines for practitioners balancing comprehensive
chemical analysis against targeted feature measurement in resource-constrained
environments.

Abstract: Molecular optimization is a central task in drug discovery that requires
precise structural reasoning and domain knowledge. While large language models
(LLMs) have shown promise in generating high-level editing intentions in
natural language, they often struggle to faithfully execute these
modifications-particularly when operating on non-intuitive representations like
SMILES. We introduce MECo, a framework that bridges reasoning and execution by
translating editing actions into executable code. MECo reformulates molecular
optimization for LLMs as a cascaded framework: generating human-interpretable
editing intentions from a molecule and property goal, followed by translating
those intentions into executable structural edits via code generation. Our
approach achieves over 98% accuracy in reproducing held-out realistic edits
derived from chemical reactions and target-specific compound pairs. On
downstream optimization benchmarks spanning physicochemical properties and
target activities, MECo substantially improves consistency by 38-86 percentage
points to 90%+ and achieves higher success rates over SMILES-based baselines
while preserving structural similarity. By aligning intention with execution,
MECo enables consistent, controllable and interpretable molecular design,
laying the foundation for high-fidelity feedback loops and collaborative
human-AI workflows in drug discovery.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于上下文近似(ICA)的数据选择和重加权框架，通过在小规模精选验证集上进行上下文学习来估计候选训练样本的验证损失，无需参考模型或额外微调，可动态调整梯度更新权重。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前微调大型预训练语言模型时，噪声或偏离目标的训练样本会稀释监督信号，而系统性和高效识别高价值训练数据的方法仍未被充分探索。

Method: 使用In-Context Approximation(ICA)方法，在局部线性化假设下，通过在小规模验证集上进行上下文学习来估计候选样本的验证损失，并基于ICA得分推导每个样本的权重，动态重加权梯度更新。

Result: 在SFT、DPO和SimPO等不同训练方法以及多种骨干网络和数据集上，ICA重加权方法持续提升了模型对齐性能，且开销极小。

Conclusion: ICA框架为数据选择和重加权提供了理论基础和高效实现，能够有效提升模型对齐效果，但面对快速漂移的在线策略更新时存在局限性，这是未来工作的方向。

Abstract: Fine-tuning large pretrained language models is a common approach for
aligning them with human preferences, but noisy or off-target examples can
dilute supervision. While small, well-chosen datasets often match the
performance of much larger ones, systematic and efficient ways to identify
high-value training data remain underexplored. Many current methods rely on
heuristics or expensive retraining. We present a theoretically grounded,
resource-efficient framework for data selection and reweighting. At its core is
an In-Context Approximation (ICA) that estimates the holdout loss a model would
incur after training on a candidate example by conditioning on a small, curated
holdout set in context. ICA requires no reference model and no additional
finetuning. Under a local linearization, ICA is equivalent to a first-order
update toward the holdout optimum, motivating its use as a proxy for data
value. We derive per-example weights from ICA scores, dynamically reweighting
gradient updates as model parameters evolve. Across SFT, DPO, and SimPO, and
over diverse backbones and datasets, ICA-based reweighting consistently
improves model alignment with minimal overhead. We analyze sensitivity to score
update frequency and the choice of $k$ holdout examples for in-context
demonstrations, and note limitations for rapidly drifting on-policy updates,
highlighting directions for future work. Code and prompts will be released.

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Causal discovery algorithms often perform poorly with limited samples. While
integrating expert knowledge (including from LLMs) as constraints promises to
improve performance, guarantees for existing methods require perfect
predictions or uncertainty estimates, making them unreliable for practical use.
We propose the Guess2Graph (G2G) framework, which uses expert guesses to guide
the sequence of statistical tests rather than replacing them. This maintains
statistical consistency while enabling performance improvements. We develop two
instantiations of G2G: PC-Guess, which augments the PC algorithm, and
gPC-Guess, a learning-augmented variant designed to better leverage
high-quality expert input. Theoretically, both preserve correctness regardless
of expert error, with gPC-Guess provably outperforming its non-augmented
counterpart in finite samples when experts are "better than random."
Empirically, both show monotonic improvement with expert accuracy, with
gPC-Guess achieving significantly stronger gains.

TL;DR: 提出可逆学习框架，通过状态可逆性度量和选择性回滚操作，提升基于价值的强化学习在部分不可逆环境中的鲁棒性和效率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决基于价值的强化学习智能体在部分不可逆环境中容易产生价值高估和不稳定的问题，提高决策安全性和可靠性

Method: 使用经验推导的状态-动作可逆性度量Phi(s,a)来量化固定时间范围内返回先前状态的可能性，并引入选择性状态回滚操作来中断次优高风险轨迹

Result: 在CliffWalking v0环境中减少99.8%的灾难性跌落，平均回合回报提升55%；在Taxi v3环境中抑制99.9%的非法动作，累积奖励提升65.7%，同时显著降低奖励方差

Conclusion: 回滚机制是实现安全性和性能提升的关键组件，为安全可靠的序列决策迈出了坚实一步

Abstract: This paper proposes a reversible learning framework to improve the robustness
and efficiency of value based Reinforcement Learning agents, addressing
vulnerability to value overestimation and instability in partially irreversible
environments. The framework has two complementary core mechanisms: an
empirically derived transition reversibility measure called Phi of s and a, and
a selective state rollback operation. We introduce an online per state action
estimator called Phi that quantifies the likelihood of returning to a prior
state within a fixed horizon K. This measure is used to adjust the penalty term
during temporal difference updates dynamically, integrating reversibility
awareness directly into the value function. The system also includes a
selective rollback operator. When an action yields an expected return markedly
lower than its instantaneous estimated value and violates a predefined
threshold, the agent is penalized and returns to the preceding state rather
than progressing. This interrupts sub optimal high risk trajectories and avoids
catastrophic steps. By combining reversibility aware evaluation with targeted
rollback, the method improves safety, performance, and stability. In the
CliffWalking v0 domain, the framework reduced catastrophic falls by over 99.8
percent and yielded a 55 percent increase in mean episode return. In the Taxi
v3 domain, it suppressed illegal actions by greater than or equal to 99.9
percent and achieved a 65.7 percent improvement in cumulative reward, while
also sharply reducing reward variance in both environments. Ablation studies
confirm that the rollback mechanism is the critical component underlying these
safety and performance gains, marking a robust step toward safe and reliable
sequential decision making.

Conclusion: 选择性表示空间能够有效提升时间序列预测性能，SRS模块具有通用性和有效性。

Abstract: Time Series Forecasting has made significant progress with the help of
Patching technique, which partitions time series into multiple patches to
effectively retain contextual semantic information into a representation space
beneficial for modeling long-term dependencies. However, conventional patching
partitions a time series into adjacent patches, which causes a fixed
representation space, thus resulting in insufficiently expressful
representations. In this paper, we pioneer the exploration of constructing a
selective representation space to flexibly include the most informative patches
for forecasting. Specifically, we propose the Selective Representation Space
(SRS) module, which utilizes the learnable Selective Patching and Dynamic
Reassembly techniques to adaptively select and shuffle the patches from the
contextual time series, aiming at fully exploiting the information of
contextual time series to enhance the forecasting performance of patch-based
models. To demonstrate the effectiveness of SRS module, we propose a simple yet
effective SRSNet consisting of SRS and an MLP head, which achieves
state-of-the-art performance on real-world datasets from multiple domains.
Furthermore, as a novel plugin-and-play module, SRS can also enhance the
performance of existing patch-based models. The resources are available at

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于先验预测矩匹配的严格方法来确定概率张量模型中的秩可识别性，将矩匹配条件转化为对数线性方程组，并证明了秩可识别性与该方程组可解性的等价关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 张量分解中潜在维度（秩）的选择是一个核心挑战，通常依赖于启发式方法，需要一种更严谨的方法来确定秩的可识别性。

Method: 将矩匹配条件转化为关于边际矩、先验超参数和秩的对数线性方程组，建立秩可识别性与方程组可解性的等价关系，并应用于四种基础张量模型。

Conclusion: 该方法为张量分解中的秩选择提供了理论基础，并通过经验验证了估计器的有效性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Selecting the latent dimensions (ranks) in tensor factorization is a central
challenge that often relies on heuristic methods. This paper introduces a
rigorous approach to determine rank identifiability in probabilistic tensor
models, based on prior predictive moment matching. We transform a set of moment
matching conditions into a log-linear system of equations in terms of marginal
moments, prior hyperparameters, and ranks; establishing an equivalence between
rank identifiability and the solvability of such system. We apply this
framework to four foundational tensor-models, demonstrating that the linear
structure of the PARAFAC/CP model, the chain structure of the Tensor Train
model, and the closed-loop structure of the Tensor Ring model yield solvable
systems, making their ranks identifiable. In contrast, we prove that the
symmetric topology of the Tucker model leads to an underdetermined system,
rendering the ranks unidentifiable by this method. For the identifiable models,
we derive explicit closed-form rank estimators based on the moments of observed
data only. We empirically validate these estimators and evaluate the robustness
of the proposal.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了MX+格式，一种基于微缩放格式的非侵入式扩展，通过重新利用异常值的指数字段作为扩展尾数来提高精度，在4位精度下显著提升语言模型性能，存储开销和速度损失可忽略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的低精度数据格式要么需要侵入式修改软件框架，要么不够通用。现有的超低位块浮点格式由于块中的异常值问题，难以提供合理的语言模型性能。

Method: 基于微缩放格式提出MX+扩展，关键洞察是异常值不需要使用其元素数据类型中的指数字段，因此可以重新利用该字段作为扩展尾数来提高异常值元素的精度。

Result: MX+相比4位MX格式（MXFP4）实现了显著更高的模型性能，存储开销和速度损失可忽略，为高效LLM推理提供了有吸引力的MXFP4或MXFP6替代方案。

Conclusion: MX+是一种成本效益高且非侵入式的解决方案，能够有效解决块浮点格式中的异常值问题，在4位精度下为大型语言模型服务提供了更好的性能表现。

Abstract: Reduced-precision data formats are crucial for cost-effective serving of
large language models (LLMs). While numerous reduced-precision formats have
been introduced thus far, they often require intrusive modifications to the
software frameworks or are rather unconventional for widespread adoption across
hardware vendors. In this paper, we instead focus on recent industry-driven
variants of block floating-point (BFP) formats and conduct a comprehensive
analysis to push their limits for efficient LLM serving. Our analysis shows
that existing ultra low-bit BFP variants struggle to provide reasonable
language model performance due to outlier values in blocks. To address the
outliers with BFPs, we propose MX+, a cost-effective and non-intrusive
extension designed for seamless integration into the microscaling (MX) formats.
MX+ builds on the key insight that the outlier does not need to use its
exponent field in the element data type, which allows us to repurpose the
exponent field as an extended mantissa to increase the precision of the outlier
element. Our evaluation shows that MX+ achieves significantly higher model
performance compared to the 4-bit MX format (MXFP4) with negligible storage
overhead and slowdown, thus offering a compelling alternative to MXFP4 or MXFP6
for efficient LLM inference.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 训练数据和测试数据之间的分布差异导致模型在遇到分布外样本时预测不准确，现有图OOD检测方法受结构冗余影响性能受限。

Method: 提出RedOUT框架，集成结构熵到测试时OOD检测中，引入冗余感知图信息瓶颈(ReGIB)，将目标分解为本质信息和无关冗余，通过最小化结构熵减少解耦的冗余。

Result: 在真实数据集上的广泛实验显示RedOUT在OOD检测上表现优异，平均提升6.7%，在ClinTox/LIPO数据集对上显著超越最佳竞争对手17.3%。

Conclusion: RedOUT通过结构熵和ReGIB有效解决了图OOD检测中的结构冗余问题，显著提升了检测性能。

Abstract: Distributional discrepancy between training and test data can lead models to
make inaccurate predictions when encountering out-of-distribution (OOD) samples
in real-world applications. Although existing graph OOD detection methods
leverage data-centric techniques to extract effective representations, their
performance remains compromised by structural redundancy that induces semantic
shifts. To address this dilemma, we propose RedOUT, an unsupervised framework
that integrates structural entropy into test-time OOD detection for graph
classification. Concretely, we introduce the Redundancy-aware Graph Information
Bottleneck (ReGIB) and decompose the objective into essential information and
irrelevant redundancy. By minimizing structural entropy, the decoupled
redundancy is reduced, and theoretically grounded upper and lower bounds are
proposed for optimization. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets
demonstrate the superior performance of RedOUT on OOD detection. Specifically,
our method achieves an average improvement of 6.7%, significantly surpassing
the best competitor by 17.3% on the ClinTox/LIPO dataset pair.

Motivation: Transformer在表格数据基础模型中表现出色，但其二次复杂度限制了处理长序列的能力，因此需要探索更高效的序列模型。

Method: 使用Hydra双向SSM替代Transformer，通过双向上下文聚合来减少对输入顺序的依赖，同时保持线性时间复杂度。

Result: 该方法显著降低了顺序依赖性，预测性能与原TabPFN模型相当。

Conclusion: Hydra双向SSM是Transformer在表格数据基础模型中的有效替代方案，在保持性能的同时提高了效率。

Abstract: Recent advancements in foundation models for tabular data, such as TabPFN,
demonstrated that pretrained Transformer architectures can approximate Bayesian
inference with high predictive performance. However, Transformers suffer from
quadratic complexity with respect to sequence length, motivating the
exploration of more efficient sequence models. In this work, we investigate the
potential of using Hydra, a bidirectional linear-time structured state space
model (SSM), as an alternative to Transformers in TabPFN. A key challenge lies
in SSM's inherent sensitivity to the order of input tokens - an undesirable
property for tabular datasets where the row order is semantically meaningless.
We investigate to what extent a bidirectional approach can preserve efficiency
and enable symmetric context aggregation. Our experiments show that this
approach reduces the order-dependence, achieving predictive performance
competitive to the original TabPFN model.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Conformal Labeling的新方法，通过控制AI标签子集中的错误发现率(FDR)，为AI预测的可信度提供理论保证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决AI模型在数据标注中存在的标签质量问题，现有选择性标注方法缺乏对AI标签质量的理论保证，导致AI标注子集的错误率过高。

Method: 为每个测试实例构建符合性p值，通过比较AI模型的预测置信度与校准实例中被AI错误标注的置信度，选择p值低于数据依赖阈值的实例作为可信AI预测。

Result: 实验表明该方法在各种任务（图像和文本标注、LLM问答）中实现了严格的FDR控制和高功效。

Conclusion: Conformal Labeling方法能够有效控制AI标注的错误率，为AI预测的可信度提供理论保证，是解决大规模数据标注质量问题的有效方案。

Abstract: Obtaining high-quality labels for large datasets is expensive, requiring
massive annotations from human experts. While AI models offer a cost-effective
alternative by predicting labels, their label quality is compromised by the
unavoidable labeling errors. Existing methods mitigate this issue through
selective labeling, where AI labels a subset and human labels the remainder.
However, these methods lack theoretical guarantees on the quality of
AI-assigned labels, often resulting in unacceptably high labeling error within
the AI-labeled subset. To address this, we introduce \textbf{Conformal
Labeling}, a novel method to identify instances where AI predictions can be
provably trusted. This is achieved by controlling the false discovery rate
(FDR), the proportion of incorrect labels within the selected subset. In
particular, we construct a conformal $p$-value for each test instance by
comparing AI models' predicted confidence to those of calibration instances
mislabeled by AI models. Then, we select test instances whose $p$-values are
below a data-dependent threshold, certifying AI models' predictions as
trustworthy. We provide theoretical guarantees that Conformal Labeling controls
the FDR below the nominal level, ensuring that a predefined fraction of
AI-assigned labels is correct on average. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our method achieves tight FDR control with high power across various
tasks, including image and text labeling, and LLM QA.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of protein-ligand binding poses is crucial for
structure-based drug design, yet existing methods struggle to balance speed,
accuracy, and physical plausibility. We introduce Matcha, a novel molecular
docking pipeline that combines multi-stage flow matching with learned scoring
and physical validity filtering. Our approach consists of three sequential
stages applied consecutively to refine docking predictions, each implemented as
a flow matching model operating on appropriate geometric spaces
($\mathbb{R}^3$, $\mathrm{SO}(3)$, and $\mathrm{SO}(2)$). We enhance the
prediction quality through a dedicated scoring model and apply unsupervised
physical validity filters to eliminate unrealistic poses. Compared to various
approaches, Matcha demonstrates superior performance on Astex and PDBbind test
sets in terms of docking success rate and physical plausibility. Moreover, our
method works approximately 25 times faster than modern large-scale co-folding
models. The model weights and inference code to reproduce our results are

Motivation: 现有的transformer设计在多GPU并行训练中存在显著的通信开销，特别是在Tensor Parallelism中，每个块的MHA-MLP连接需要all-reduce通信。研究发现MHA-MLP连接可以绕过以提高效率。

Method: 提出FAL架构，将第一层MHA输出重定向到后续层的MLP输入，消除了每块的MHA-MLP连接。FAL+版本在MHA输出中添加归一化的第一注意力输出来增强MLP输入质量。

Result: FAL将多GPU训练时间减少高达44%，单GPU吞吐量提高1.18倍，并且比基线GPT获得更好的困惑度。FAL+在不增加训练时间的情况下实现了更低的困惑度。

Conclusion: FAL和FAL+通过消除MHA-MLP连接中的通信瓶颈，显著提高了transformer的训练效率和模型质量。

Abstract: As training billion-scale transformers becomes increasingly common, employing
multiple distributed GPUs along with parallel training methods has become a
standard practice. However, existing transformer designs suffer from
significant communication overhead, especially in Tensor Parallelism (TP),
where each block's MHA-MLP connection requires an all-reduce communication.
Through our investigation, we show that the MHA-MLP connections can be bypassed
for efficiency, while the attention output of the first layer can serve as an
alternative signal for the bypassed connection. Motivated by the observations,
we propose FAL (First Attentions Last), an efficient transformer architecture
that redirects the first MHA output to the MLP inputs of the following layers,
eliminating the per-block MHA-MLP connections. This removes the all-reduce
communication and enables parallel execution of MHA and MLP on a single GPU. We
also introduce FAL+, which adds the normalized first attention output to the
MHA outputs of the following layers to augment the MLP input for the model
quality. Our evaluation shows that FAL reduces multi-GPU training time by up to
44%, improves single-GPU throughput by up to 1.18x, and achieves better
perplexity compared to the baseline GPT. FAL+ achieves even lower perplexity
without increasing the training time than the baseline.

Abstract: The growing integration of machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence
(AI) models into high-stakes domains such as healthcare and scientific research
calls for models that are not only accurate but also interpretable. Among the
existing explainable methods, counterfactual explanations offer
interpretability by identifying minimal changes to inputs that would alter a
model's prediction, thus providing deeper insights. However, current
counterfactual generation methods suffer from critical limitations, including
gradient vanishing, discontinuous latent spaces, and an overreliance on the
alignment between learned and true decision boundaries. To overcome these
limitations, we propose LeapFactual, a novel counterfactual explanation
algorithm based on conditional flow matching. LeapFactual generates reliable
and informative counterfactuals, even when true and learned decision boundaries
diverge. Following a model-agnostic approach, LeapFactual is not limited to
models with differentiable loss functions. It can even handle human-in-the-loop
systems, expanding the scope of counterfactual explanations to domains that
require the participation of human annotators, such as citizen science. We
provide extensive experiments on benchmark and real-world datasets showing that
LeapFactual generates accurate and in-distribution counterfactual explanations
that offer actionable insights. We observe, for instance, that our reliable
counterfactual samples with labels aligning to ground truth can be beneficially
used as new training data to enhance the model. The proposed method is broadly
applicable and enhances both scientific knowledge discovery and non-expert
interpretability.

low-order statistical moments of the source and target distributions in an

alternative that instead leverages the intrinsic geometry of these
distributions by adopting a Riemannian distance for this alignment. Our key
novelty lies in expressing the first- and second-order moments as a single
symmetric positive definite (SPD) matrix through Siegel embeddings. This
enables simultaneous adaptation of both moments using the natural geometric
distance on the shared manifold of SPD matrices, preserving the mean and
covariance structure of the source and target distributions and yielding a more
faithful metric for cross-domain comparison. We connect the Riemannian manifold
distance to the target-domain error bound, and validate the method on image
denoising and image classification benchmarks. Our code is publicly available

TL;DR: 提出了FedPPA方法，通过渐进式参数对齐解决联邦学习中模型和数据异构性问题，在非IID设置下提升个性化性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实联邦学习场景中客户端存在计算资源异构性和非IID数据分布，现有个性化联邦学习方法通常忽视模型和数据异构性共存的问题

Method: FedPPA方法渐进对齐客户端通用层权重与全局模型权重，同时保留客户端本地知识，并集成基于熵的加权平均

Result: 在MNIST、FMNIST和CIFAR-10数据集上的实验表明，FedPPA优于现有联邦学习算法，在个性化适应方面表现优异

Conclusion: FedPPA能有效缓解客户端更新时全局与局部模型的不一致性，增强非IID设置下的个性化鲁棒性

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is designed as a decentralized, privacy-preserving
machine learning paradigm that enables multiple clients to collaboratively
train a model without sharing their data. In real-world scenarios, however,
clients often have heterogeneous computational resources and hold
non-independent and identically distributed data (non-IID), which poses
significant challenges during training. Personalized Federated Learning (PFL)
has emerged to address these issues by customizing models for each client based
on their unique data distribution. Despite its potential, existing PFL
approaches typically overlook the coexistence of model and data heterogeneity
arising from clients with diverse computational capabilities. To overcome this
limitation, we propose a novel method, called Progressive Parameter Alignment
(FedPPA), which progressively aligns the weights of common layers across
clients with the global model's weights. Our approach not only mitigates
inconsistencies between global and local models during client updates, but also
preserves client's local knowledge, thereby enhancing personalization
robustness in non-IID settings. To further enhance the global model performance
while retaining strong personalization, we also integrate entropy-based
weighted averaging into the FedPPA framework. Experiments on three image
classification datasets, including MNIST, FMNIST, and CIFAR-10, demonstrate
that FedPPA consistently outperforms existing FL algorithms, achieving superior
performance in personalized adaptation.

*Alexandru Meterez,Depen Morwani,Jingfeng Wu,Costin-Andrei Oncescu,Cengiz Pehlevan,Sham Kakade*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Seesaw是一种批处理大小调度方法，通过将学习率乘以1/√2并加倍批处理大小来替代传统学习率减半策略，在保持损失动态的同时减少串行步骤，加速大语言模型预训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 批处理大小增加是加速大语言模型预训练的有前景策略，但对于Adam等自适应优化器的最优策略尚不明确，通常需要启发式调优。

Method: 提出Seesaw框架：当标准调度器要减半学习率时，改为将学习率乘以1/√2并加倍批处理大小。理论证明SGD中学习率衰减与批处理大小增加的等价性，并扩展到归一化SGD作为Adam的代理。

Result: 在Chinchilla规模上训练150M/300M/600M参数模型，Seesaw在相同FLOPs下匹配余弦衰减性能，同时减少约36%的挂钟时间，接近理论极限。

Conclusion: Seesaw提供了一种原则性的批处理大小调度方法，显著加速大语言模型预训练，同时保持模型性能。

Abstract: Increasing the batch size during training -- a ''batch ramp'' -- is a
promising strategy to accelerate large language model pretraining. While for
SGD, doubling the batch size can be equivalent to halving the learning rate,
the optimal strategy for adaptive optimizers like Adam is less clear. As a
result, any batch-ramp scheduling, if used at all, is typically tuned
heuristically. This work develops a principled framework for batch-size
scheduling and introduces Seesaw: whenever a standard scheduler would halve the
learning rate, Seesaw instead multiplies it by $1/\sqrt{2}$ and doubles the
batch size, preserving loss dynamics while reducing serial steps.
Theoretically, we provide, to our knowledge, the first finite-sample proof of
equivalence between learning-rate decay and batch-size ramp-up for SGD on noisy
linear regression, and we extend this equivalence to normalized SGD, a
tractable proxy for Adam, under a variance-dominated regime observed in
practice. Empirically, on 150M/300M/600M-parameter models trained at Chinchilla
scale using a constant (critical) batch size, Seesaw matches cosine decay at
equal FLOPs while reducing wall-clock time by $\approx 36\%$, approaching the
theoretical limit implied by our analysis.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Tawa是一个自动化编译器，能从高层瓦片化程序自动生成高性能的warp专业化代码，通过异步引用抽象隐藏硬件细节，显著降低编程复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代GPU的异步数据流执行硬件与SIMT编程模型不匹配，导致程序可编程性差距。硬件级warp专业化虽能提升性能，但需要开发者手动管理复杂通信和软件管道，过程繁琐易错。

Method: 提出Tawa编译器，采用新颖的异步引用IR抽象来表达warp级通信，自动将程序划分为生产者-消费者角色并管理数据流管道，无需手动重写内核。

Result: 在NVIDIA H100 GPU上评估显示，Tawa在LLM内核中实现高硬件利用率，比高度优化的cuBLAS GEMM内核快1.1倍，注意力工作负载比Triton快1.2倍，性能与手工优化的CUTLASS C++ FlashAttention-3内核相当但编程工作量大幅减少。

Conclusion: Tawa通过自动化warp专业化代码生成，有效弥合了GPU硬件能力与编程模型之间的差距，在保持高性能的同时显著降低了开发复杂度。

Abstract: Modern GPUs feature specialized hardware units that enable high-performance,
asynchronous dataflow execution. However, the conventional SIMT programming
model is fundamentally misaligned with this task-parallel hardware, creating a
significant programmability gap. While hardware-level warp specialization is
the key to unlocking peak performance, it forces developers to manually
orchestrate complex, low-level communication and software pipelines--a process
that is labor-intensive, error-prone, and unsustainable. To address this
challenge, we present Tawa, an automated compiler that systematically generates
high-performance, warp-specialized code from a high-level, tile-based program.
Central to our approach is a novel IR abstraction, asynchronous references
(aref), which expresses warp-level communication without exposing low-level
hardware details. Using this abstraction, Tawa automatically partitions
programs into producer-consumer roles and manages the intricate dataflow
pipeline, relieving developers of invasive kernel rewriting. Evaluation on
NVIDIA H100 GPUs across representative LLM kernels shows that Tawa delivers
high hardware utilization, achieving up to 1.1$\times$ speedup over highly
optimized cuBLAS GEMM kernels. For attention workloads, Tawa attains
1.2$\times$ speedup over Triton and matches the performance of the
hand-optimized CUTLASS C++ FlashAttention-3 kernel with far less programming
effort.

TL;DR: INDAGO-Nexus是一个多目标搜索方法，用于发现深度强化学习代理的多样化故障场景，相比单目标优化的INDAGO显著提高了独特故障发现率和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工具如INDAGO仅关注最大化故障数量，无法确保发现的故障场景具有多样性或揭示不同的错误类型。

Method: 使用多目标进化算法，联合优化故障可能性和测试场景多样性，采用多种多样性指标和帕累托前沿选择策略。

Result: 在三个DRL代理上评估：人形步行者、自动驾驶汽车和停车代理。平均而言，INDAGO-Nexus在SDC和停车场景中分别比INDAGO多发现83%和40%的独特故障，同时所有代理的故障发现时间减少高达67%。

Conclusion: INDAGO-Nexus通过多目标优化方法显著提高了测试深度强化学习代理的故障场景多样性和发现效率。

Abstract: Testing deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agents in safety-critical domains
requires discovering diverse failure scenarios. Existing tools such as INDAGO
rely on single-objective optimization focused solely on maximizing failure
counts, but this does not ensure discovered scenarios are diverse or reveal
distinct error types. We introduce INDAGO-Nexus, a multi-objective search
approach that jointly optimizes for failure likelihood and test scenario
diversity using multi-objective evolutionary algorithms with multiple diversity
metrics and Pareto front selection strategies. We evaluated INDAGO-Nexus on
three DRL agents: humanoid walker, self-driving car, and parking agent. On
average, INDAGO-Nexus discovers up to 83% and 40% more unique failures (test
effectiveness) than INDAGO in the SDC and Parking scenarios, respectively,
while reducing time-to-failure by up to 67% across all agents.

TL;DR: 本文提出未来摘要预测(FSP)方法，通过预测长文本的紧凑表示来改进大型语言模型的长程推理能力，相比传统下一词预测和多重词预测有显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统下一词预测(NTP)在长程推理、规划和创意写作方面存在局限，多重词预测(MTP)只能捕捉短程依赖关系，改进有限。需要一种能更好处理长文本生成的方法。

Method: 提出未来摘要预测(FSP)，训练辅助头来预测长文本未来的紧凑表示。探索两种变体：手工制作的摘要(如词袋)和学习的摘要(使用从右到左训练的反向语言模型生成的嵌入)。

Result: 大规模预训练实验(30亿和80亿参数模型)显示，FSP在数学、推理和编程基准测试中均优于NTP和MTP。

Conclusion: FSP通过预测长文本的紧凑表示，有效提升了语言模型的长程推理能力，为长文本生成任务提供了更好的解决方案。

Abstract: Next-token prediction (NTP) has driven the success of large language models
(LLMs), but it struggles with long-horizon reasoning, planning, and creative
writing, with these limitations largely attributed to teacher-forced training.
Multi-token prediction (MTP) partially mitigates these issues by predicting
several future tokens at once, but it mostly captures short-range dependencies
and offers limited improvement. We propose future summary prediction (FSP),
which trains an auxiliary head to predict a compact representation of the
long-term future, preserving information relevant for long-form generations. We
explore two variants of FSP: handcrafted summaries, for example, a bag of words
summary of the future of the sequence, and learned summaries, which use
embeddings produced by a reverse language model trained from right to left.
Large-scale pretraining experiments (3B and 8B-parameter models) demonstrate
that FSP provides improvements over both NTP and MTP across math, reasoning,
and coding benchmarks.

Motivation: 现有的被动众包方法效率较低，需要开发能够自适应引导移动代理收集高价值测量数据的主动定位方法，同时考虑城市环境中的障碍物和移动约束。

Method: 修改A*算法为A-UCB*，将采集值纳入轨迹成本计算，生成高采集值的规划路径，结合贝叶斯优化来指导移动代理收集信号强度测量数据。

Abstract: We propose an active jammer localization framework that combines Bayesian

Received Signal Strength measurements while accounting for urban obstacles and

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Hebbian学习在机器学习中存在连接更新无约束和缺乏反馈调节的问题，限制了其在复杂网络架构和任务中的有效扩展。

Method: SPHeRe通过局部辅助非线性块整合正交性和结构信息保留，使用轻量级投影进行反馈调节，正交性约束确保更新幅度的有界性。

Result: 在CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100和Tiny-ImageNet等标准图像分类基准测试中达到无监督突触可塑性方法的SOTA性能，在持续学习和迁移学习场景中表现优异。

Conclusion: 这项工作展示了Hebbian无监督学习规则在现代深度学习框架中的竞争力和潜力，证明了无需严格依赖反向传播的高效生物启发学习算法的可能性。

Abstract: Hebbian learning is a biological principle that intuitively describes how
neurons adapt their connections through repeated stimuli. However, when applied
to machine learning, it suffers serious issues due to the unconstrained updates
of the connections and the lack of accounting for feedback mediation. Such
shortcomings limit its effective scaling to complex network architectures and
tasks. To this end, here we introduce the Structural Projection Hebbian
Representation (SPHeRe), a novel unsupervised learning method that integrates
orthogonality and structural information preservation through a local auxiliary
nonlinear block. The loss for structural information preservation
backpropagates to the input through an auxiliary lightweight projection that
conceptually serves as feedback mediation while the orthogonality constraints
account for the boundedness of updating magnitude. Extensive experimental
results show that SPHeRe achieves SOTA performance among unsupervised synaptic
plasticity approaches on standard image classification benchmarks, including
CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet. Furthermore, the method exhibits strong
effectiveness in continual learning and transfer learning scenarios, and image
reconstruction tasks show the robustness and generalizability of the extracted
features. This work demonstrates the competitiveness and potential of Hebbian
unsupervised learning rules within modern deep learning frameworks,
demonstrating the possibility of efficient and biologically inspired learning
algorithms without the strong dependence on strict backpropagation. Our code is
available at https://github.com/brain-intelligence-lab/SPHeRe.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 结构化稀疏在现代GPU上能加速训练和推理，但在准确率上仍落后于非结构化动态稀疏训练，主要原因是表达能力受限。

Method: 为每层学习一个排列矩阵与结构化权重矩阵联合训练，应用于块、N:M和对角线三种典型结构。

Result: 在ImageNet-1K和WikiText-103上，PA-DST在90-95%稀疏度下匹配非结构化基线准确率，同时训练快1.21倍，推理快2.9倍。

Conclusion: 结构+学习排列在准确率和效率之间找到了最佳平衡点。

Abstract: Structured sparsity accelerates training and inference on modern GPUs, yet it
still trails unstructured dynamic sparse training (DST) in accuracy. The
shortfall stems from a loss of expressivity: whereas a dense layer can realize
every possible mask obtained by choosing any $w$ active weights out of $n$, a
fixed block or N:M layout explores only a subset of those possibilities. We
propose to close this gap by learning, for each layer, a single permutation
matrix jointly with the structured weight matrix. Applied to three canonical
structures -- block, N:M, and diagonals -- we show that permutation-augmented
DST (PA-DST) matches unstructured baselines (RigL, SET) at 90--95\% sparsity on
ImageNet-1K (ViT-B/16) and WikiText-103 (GPT-2), yet trains up to $1.21\times$
and infers up to $2.9\times$ faster. The results position structure + learned
permutation as a sweet spot between accuracy and efficiency.

Motivation: 时间序列数据具有动态特性，存在概念漂移和时间偏移两种分布偏移。现有研究主要关注时间偏移，而针对时间序列预测的概念漂移方法研究较少

Method: 提出ShifTS框架：1）先处理时间偏移；2）使用软注意力机制从回看和预测时间序列中寻找不变模式来处理概念漂移

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，ShifTS能持续提升无关模型的预测精度，优于现有的概念漂移、时间偏移及组合基线方法

Conclusion: ShifTS框架通过先处理时间偏移再处理概念漂移的统一方法，有效解决了时间序列预测中的分布偏移问题

Abstract: Time-series forecasting finds broad applications in real-world scenarios. Due
to the dynamic nature of time series data, it is important for time-series
forecasting models to handle potential distribution shifts over time. In this
paper, we initially identify two types of distribution shifts in time series:
concept drift and temporal shift. We acknowledge that while existing studies
primarily focus on addressing temporal shift issues in time series forecasting,
designing proper concept drift methods for time series forecasting has received
comparatively less attention.
  Motivated by the need to address potential concept drift, while conventional
concept drift methods via invariant learning face certain challenges in
time-series forecasting, we propose a soft attention mechanism that finds
invariant patterns from both lookback and horizon time series. Additionally, we
emphasize the critical importance of mitigating temporal shifts as a
preliminary to addressing concept drift. In this context, we introduce ShifTS,
a method-agnostic framework designed to tackle temporal shift first and then
concept drift within a unified approach. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
efficacy of ShifTS in consistently enhancing the forecasting accuracy of
agnostic models across multiple datasets, and outperforming existing concept
drift, temporal shift, and combined baselines.

Method: 使用LLM合成代码特征函数，结合决策树构建LeaPR模型。提出两种算法：FunSearch的改编版本学习特征，以及ID3算法的变体在分裂节点时按需生成新特征。

Result: 在象棋位置评估、图像和文本分类等任务中，LeaPR模型学习到高质量的非神经网络预测器，性能与神经网络相当。

Conclusion: LeaPR提供了一个灵活的学习范式，能够端到端学习可解释的表征，特征和预测结果都可以被轻松检查和理解。

Abstract: Classical models for supervised machine learning, such as decision trees, are
efficient and interpretable predictors, but their quality is highly dependent
on the particular choice of input features. Although neural networks can learn
useful representations directly from raw data (e.g., images or text), this
comes at the expense of interpretability and the need for specialized hardware
to run them efficiently. In this paper, we explore a hypothesis class we call
Learned Programmatic Representations (LeaPR) models, which stack arbitrary
features represented as code (functions from data points to scalars) and
decision tree predictors. We synthesize feature functions using Large Language
Models (LLMs), which have rich prior knowledge in a wide range of domains and a
remarkable ability to write code using existing domain-specific libraries. We
propose two algorithms to learn LeaPR models from supervised data. First, we
design an adaptation of FunSearch to learn features rather than directly
generate predictors. Then, we develop a novel variant of the classical ID3
algorithm for decision tree learning, where new features are generated on
demand when splitting leaf nodes. In experiments from chess position evaluation
to image and text classification, our methods learn high-quality, neural
network-free predictors often competitive with neural networks. Our work
suggests a flexible paradigm for learning interpretable representations
end-to-end where features and predictions can be readily inspected and
understood.

Result: 工具增强的SSMs在算术、推理和编程任务上实现了显著的序列长度泛化能力。

Conclusion: SSMs在交互式工具和代理设置中可能成为Transformer的高效替代方案。

Abstract: State Space Models (SSMs) have become the leading alternative to Transformers
for sequence modeling. Their primary advantage is efficiency in long-context
and long-form generation, enabled by fixed-size memory and linear scaling of
computational complexity. We begin this work by showing a simple theoretical
result stating that SSMs cannot accurately solve any ``truly long-form''
generation problem (in a sense we formally define), undermining their main
competitive advantage. However, we show that this limitation can be mitigated
by allowing SSMs interactive access to external tools. In fact, we show that
given the right choice of tool access and problem-dependent training data, SSMs
can learn to solve any tractable problem and generalize to arbitrary problem
length/complexity (i.e., achieve length generalization). Following our
theoretical finding, we demonstrate that tool-augmented SSMs achieve remarkable
length generalization on a variety of arithmetic, reasoning, and coding tasks.
These findings highlight SSMs as a potential efficient alternative to
Transformers in interactive tool-based and agentic settings.

Abstract: The emerging paradigm of 6G multiple Radio Access Technology (multi-RAT)
networks, where cellular and Wireless Fidelity (WiFi) transmitters coexist,
requires mobility decisions that remain reliable under fast channel dynamics,
interference, and heterogeneous coverage. Handover in multi-RAT deployments is
still highly reactive and event-triggered, relying on instantaneous
measurements and threshold events. This work proposes a Machine Learning
(ML)-assisted Predictive Conditional Handover (P-CHO) framework based on a
model-driven and short-horizon signal quality forecasts. We present a
generalized P-CHO sequence workflow orchestrated by a RAT Steering Controller,
which standardizes data collection, parallel per-RAT predictions, decision
logic with hysteresis-based conditions, and CHO execution. Considering a
realistic multi-RAT environment, we train RAT-aware Long Short Term Memory
(LSTM) networks to forecast the signal quality indicators of mobile users along
randomized trajectories. The proposed P-CHO models are trained and evaluated
under different channel models for cellular and IEEE 802.11 WiFi integrated
coverage. We study the impact of hyperparameter tuning of LSTM models under
different system settings, and compare direct multi-step versus recursive P-CHO
variants. Comparisons against baseline predictors are also carried out.
Finally, the proposed P-CHO is tested under soft and hard handover settings,
showing that hysteresis-enabled P-CHO scheme is able to reduce handover
failures and ping-pong events. Overall, the proposed P-CHO framework can enable
accurate, low-latency, and proactive handovers suitable for ML-assisted
handover steering in 6G multi-RAT deployments.

Abstract: Reward machines are an established tool for dealing with reinforcement
learning problems in which rewards are sparse and depend on complex sequences
of actions. However, existing algorithms for learning reward machines assume an
overly idealized setting where rewards have to be free of noise. To overcome
this practical limitation, we introduce a novel type of reward machines, called
stochastic reward machines, and an algorithm for learning them. Our algorithm,
based on constraint solving, learns minimal stochastic reward machines from the
explorations of a reinforcement learning agent. This algorithm can easily be
paired with existing reinforcement learning algorithms for reward machines and
guarantees to converge to an optimal policy in the limit. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our algorithm in two case studies and show that it outperforms
both existing methods and a naive approach for handling noisy reward functions.

Method: 研究发现后门在模型权重空间中与其他良性任务是解耦的，基于这一发现提出了一种简单的遗忘方法，通过隔离和擦除后门的影响来实现后门移除。

Result: 在CLIP模型和常见对抗性触发器上的实验表明，该方法实现了近乎完美的后门遗忘，同时平均保持了96%的干净准确率。即使攻击未知，也能通过逆向工程触发器成功移除后门。

Conclusion: 该方法在遗忘效果和干净准确率的权衡上优于现有最先进的防御方法，为后门防御提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Foundation models have revolutionized computer vision by enabling broad
generalization across diverse tasks. Yet, they remain highly susceptible to
adversarial perturbations and targeted backdoor attacks. Mitigating such
vulnerabilities remains an open challenge, especially given that the
large-scale nature of the models prohibits retraining to ensure safety.
Existing backdoor removal approaches rely on costly fine-tuning to override the
harmful behavior, and can often degrade performance on other unrelated tasks.
This raises the question of whether backdoors can be removed without
compromising the general capabilities of the models. In this work, we address
this question and study how backdoors are encoded in the model weight space,
finding that they are disentangled from other benign tasks. Specifically, this
separation enables the isolation and erasure of the backdoor's influence on the
model with minimal impact on clean performance. Building on this insight, we
introduce a simple unlearning method that leverages such disentanglement.
Through extensive experiments with CLIP-based models and common adversarial
triggers, we show that, given the knowledge of the attack, our method achieves
approximately perfect unlearning, while retaining, on average, 96% of clean
accuracy. Additionally, we demonstrate that even when the attack and its
presence are unknown, our method successfully unlearns backdoors by proper
estimation using reverse-engineered triggers. Overall, our method consistently
yields better unlearning and clean accuracy tradeoffs when compared to present
state-of-the-art defenses.

TL;DR: 提出Hermite特征结构假设(HEA)框架，通过数据协方差矩阵和目标函数的多项式分解来预测核回归的学习曲线，并在真实图像数据集上验证有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究如何在真实数据集上预测核回归的学习曲线，建立从数据集结构到模型性能的端到端理论框架。

Method: 提出HEA假设，通过分析核特征值和特征函数的近似来预测学习曲线，该方法在真实图像数据上表现良好。

Result: HEA在真实图像数据集(CIFAR-5m、SVHN、ImageNet)上有效，并能预测多层感知机在特征学习阶段学习Hermite多项式的顺序。

Conclusion: HEA框架证明了在真实数据集上为复杂学习算法建立从数据集结构到模型性能的端到端理论是可行的。

Abstract: We study kernel regression with common rotation-invariant kernels on real
datasets including CIFAR-5m, SVHN, and ImageNet. We give a theoretical
framework that predicts learning curves (test risk vs. sample size) from only
two measurements: the empirical data covariance matrix and an empirical
polynomial decomposition of the target function $f_*$. The key new idea is an
analytical approximation of a kernel's eigenvalues and eigenfunctions with
respect to an anisotropic data distribution. The eigenfunctions resemble
Hermite polynomials of the data, so we call this approximation the Hermite
eigenstructure ansatz (HEA). We prove the HEA for Gaussian data, but we find
that real image data is often "Gaussian enough" for the HEA to hold well in
practice, enabling us to predict learning curves by applying prior results
relating kernel eigenstructure to test risk. Extending beyond kernel
regression, we empirically find that MLPs in the feature-learning regime learn
Hermite polynomials in the order predicted by the HEA. Our HEA framework is a
proof of concept that an end-to-end theory of learning which maps dataset
structure all the way to model performance is possible for nontrivial learning
algorithms on real datasets.

TL;DR: 提出一种在无导师情况下处理无界奖励的谨慎学习算法，通过选择可信区域仅在证据充分时执行动作，避免不可逆错误。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在AI高风险应用中，传统强化学习假设所有错误都可恢复，但实际中单个错误可能造成不可逆损害。现有方法依赖导师帮助，但导师并非总是可用。

Method: 将问题建模为带弃权选项的双动作上下文赌博机，提出基于谨慎的算法：选择可信区域，仅在证据不证明有害时才执行动作。

Result: 在i.i.d.输入假设下，证明了次线性遗憾保证，理论上验证了谨慎探索在高风险环境中安全部署学习智能体的有效性。

Conclusion: 谨慎探索策略能够在不依赖导师的情况下安全部署学习智能体，避免不可逆错误，适用于高风险AI应用场景。

Abstract: In high-stakes AI applications, even a single action can cause irreparable
damage. However, nearly all of sequential decision-making theory assumes that
all errors are recoverable (e.g., by bounding rewards). Standard bandit
algorithms that explore aggressively may cause irreparable damage when this
assumption fails. Some prior work avoids irreparable errors by asking for help
from a mentor, but a mentor may not always be available. In this work, we
formalize a model of learning with unbounded rewards without a mentor as a
two-action contextual bandit with an abstain option: at each round the agent
observes an input and chooses either to abstain (always 0 reward) or to commit
(execute a preexisting task policy). Committing yields rewards that are
upper-bounded but can be arbitrarily negative, and the commit reward is assumed
Lipschitz in the input. We propose a caution-based algorithm that learns when
not to learn: it chooses a trusted region and commits only where the available
evidence does not already certify harm. Under these conditions and i.i.d.
inputs, we establish sublinear regret guarantees, theoretically demonstrating
the effectiveness of cautious exploration for deploying learning agents safely
in high-stakes environments.

Main category: cs.LG

<details>

Motivation: 探索是否能在推理阶段通过纯采样方法从基础模型中激发出与强化学习后训练相当的推理能力，而无需额外训练。

Method: 受马尔可夫链蒙特卡洛技术启发，提出基于基础模型自身似然的简单迭代采样算法。

Result: 在MATH500、HumanEval、GPQA等单次任务上，该方法显著提升推理能力，性能接近甚至超过强化学习后训练，同时保持样本多样性。

Conclusion: 该方法无需训练、精选数据集或验证器，具有广泛适用性，为激发基础模型推理能力提供了有效途径。

Abstract: Frontier reasoning models have exhibited incredible capabilities across a
wide array of disciplines, driven by posttraining large language models (LLMs)
with reinforcement learning (RL). However, despite the widespread success of
this paradigm, much of the literature has been devoted to disentangling truly
novel behaviors that emerge during RL but are not present in the base models.
In our work, we approach this question from a different angle, instead asking
whether comparable reasoning capabilites can be elicited from base models at
inference time by pure sampling, without any additional training. Inspired by
Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques for sampling from sharpened
distributions, we propose a simple iterative sampling algorithm leveraging the
base models' own likelihoods. Over different base models, we show that our
algorithm offers substantial boosts in reasoning that nearly match and even
outperform those from RL on a wide variety of single-shot tasks, including
MATH500, HumanEval, and GPQA. Moreover, our sampler avoids the collapse in
diversity over multiple samples that is characteristic of RL-posttraining.
Crucially, our method does not require training, curated datasets, or a
verifier, suggesting broad applicability beyond easily verifiable domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有可解释性方法依赖人工检查且仅限于简单任务，自动化方法常忽略特征间交互且依赖外部LLM和数据集质量。

Method: WeightLens直接从学习权重解释特征，无需解释模型或数据集；CircuitLens捕捉特征激活如何从组件交互中产生，揭示电路级动态。

Result: WeightLens在上下文无关特征上匹配或超越现有方法性能；CircuitLens能识别仅基于激活方法无法发现的电路动态。

Conclusion: 这两种方法共同提高了可解释性鲁棒性，增强了电路机制分析的可扩展性，同时保持效率和质量。

Abstract: The fields of explainable AI and mechanistic interpretability aim to uncover
the internal structure of neural networks, with circuit discovery as a central
tool for understanding model computations. Existing approaches, however, rely
on manual inspection and remain limited to toy tasks. Automated
interpretability offers scalability by analyzing isolated features and their
activations, but it often misses interactions between features and depends
strongly on external LLMs and dataset quality. Transcoders have recently made
it possible to separate feature attributions into input-dependent and
input-invariant components, providing a foundation for more systematic circuit
analysis. Building on this, we propose WeightLens and CircuitLens, two
complementary methods that go beyond activation-based analysis. WeightLens
interprets features directly from their learned weights, removing the need for
explainer models or datasets while matching or exceeding the performance of
existing methods on context-independent features. CircuitLens captures how
feature activations arise from interactions between components, revealing
circuit-level dynamics that activation-only approaches cannot identify.
Together, these methods increase interpretability robustness and enhance
scalable mechanistic analysis of circuits while maintaining efficiency and
quality.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于扩散模型原理的新采样器，用于加速循环深度语言模型的生成，在相同时间预算下比自回归生成更高效，可达到5倍加速。


<details>

Motivation: 研究循环深度模型与扩散语言模型之间的关系，利用它们的相似性来改进生成效率。

Method: 开发了新的扩散强制采样器，在每个前向传递中解码新token，同时通过循环并行细化这些token的潜在状态。

Result: 该采样器可直接应用于现有的35亿参数循环深度transformer，无需调优即可实现高达5倍的加速。

Conclusion: 循环深度模型可被视为强大的连续因果扩散语言模型，该采样器为推理时并行化额外计算提供了高效机制。

Abstract: Language models with recurrent depth, also referred to as universal or looped
when considering transformers, are defined by the capacity to increase their
computation through the repetition of layers. Recent efforts in pretraining
have demonstrated that these architectures can scale to modern language
modeling tasks while exhibiting advantages in reasoning tasks. In this work, we
examine the relationship between recurrent-depth models and diffusion language
models. Building on their similarities, we develop a new diffusion forcing
sampler for these models to accelerate generation. The sampler advances by
decoding new tokens at every forward pass of the model, while the latent states
of these tokens can be further refined in parallel through recurrence.
Theoretically, generation with our sampler is strictly more expressive than the
baseline autoregressive generation using the same time budget on modern
hardware. Moreover, this sampler, based on principles from diffusion
literature, can be directly applied to existing 3.5B recurrent-depth
transformers without any tuning, leading to up to a 5x speedup. Consequently,
our findings not only provide an efficient mechanism for parallelizing the
extra computation in recurrent-depth models at inference, but also suggest that
such models can be naturally viewed as strong continuous, though causal,
diffusion language models.

### [327] [Identity-Link IRT for Label-Free LLM Evaluation: Preserving Additivity in TVD-MI Scores](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14966)
*Zachary Robertson*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出使用恒等链接函数而非传统的logit/probit链接来保持TVD-MI成对比较的加性结构，通过Gini熵最大化推导出盒约束最小二乘模型，在保持代理排名的同时显著减少评估次数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的IRT方法使用logistic链接函数会引入曲率破坏TVD-MI成对比较的加性结构，需要找到更适合的链接函数来保持这种几何特性。

Method: 从Gini熵最大化推导出剪裁线性模型，采用盒约束最小二乘公式处理边界饱和问题，使用恒等链接函数而非非线性链接。

Result: 在33%覆盖率下实现0.117±0.008的留一RMSE，同时保持代理排名（Spearman ρ=0.972±0.015），评估次数比全密集少三倍。不同评判者间代理排名高度一致（ρ=0.872）。

Conclusion: 恒等映射最能保持TVD-MI的几何特性，为高效LLM评估提供有效方法，并可应用于其他有界响应领域。

Abstract: Pairwise comparisons of large language models using total variation distance
mutual information (TVD-MI) produce binary critic decisions per pair. We show
that averaging TVD-MI's binary trials yields centered-probability scores with
additive structure suitable for item-response theory (IRT) without nonlinear
link functions. Maximum-likelihood approaches to IRT use logistic links, but we
find empirically that these transformations introduce curvature that breaks
additivity: across three domains, the identity link yields median curl on raw
data of 0.080-0.150 (P95 = [0.474, 0.580]), whereas probit/logit introduce
substantially higher violations (median [0.245, 0.588], P95 [0.825, 2.252]). We
derive this clipped-linear model from Gini entropy maximization, yielding a
box-constrained least-squares formulation that handles boundary saturation. At
33% coverage, we achieve holdout RMSE $0.117 \pm 0.008$ while preserving agent
rankings (Spearman $\rho = 0.972 \pm 0.015$), three times fewer evaluations
than full dense. Judge robustness analysis (GPT-4o-mini vs. Llama3-70b) shows
strong agreement in agent rankings ($\rho = 0.872$) and consistent
identity-link advantage. TVD-MI's geometry is best preserved by identity
mapping for efficient LLM evaluation, applicable to other bounded-response
domains.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文扩展了生物信息神经网络（BINNs）在作物基因组预测和选择中的应用，通过整合数千个SNPs与多组学数据及先验生物知识，显著提高了预测准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基因型到表型（G2P）模型依赖直接映射，准确性有限，育种者需进行大规模昂贵的田间试验。虽然整合中间分子表型可提高预测拟合度，但这些数据在部署时不可用。BINNs旨在克服这一限制。

Method: BINNs通过编码通路级归纳偏差，在训练时利用多组学数据，但在推理时仅使用基因型数据。应用于玉米基因表达和多环境田间试验数据，并在合成代谢组学基准测试中使用完整领域知识。

Result: 在稀疏数据条件下，BINN将秩相关准确性提高了56%，并能非线性识别GWAS/TWAS无法发现的基因。在合成代谢组学基准测试中，相对于传统神经网络将预测误差降低了75%，并正确识别了最重要的非线性通路。

Conclusion: BINNs建立了一个框架，利用中间领域信息提高基因组预测准确性，揭示非线性生物学关系，可指导基因组选择、候选基因选择、通路富集和基因编辑优先排序。

Abstract: We extend biologically-informed neural networks (BINNs) for genomic
prediction (GP) and selection (GS) in crops by integrating thousands of
single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with multi-omics measurements and prior
biological knowledge. Traditional genotype-to-phenotype (G2P) models depend
heavily on direct mappings that achieve only modest accuracy, forcing breeders
to conduct large, costly field trials to maintain or marginally improve genetic
gain. Models that incorporate intermediate molecular phenotypes such as gene
expression can achieve higher predictive fit, but they remain impractical for
GS since such data are unavailable at deployment or design time. BINNs overcome
this limitation by encoding pathway-level inductive biases and leveraging
multi-omics data only during training, while using genotype data alone during
inference. Applied to maize gene-expression and multi-environment field-trial
data, BINN improves rank-correlation accuracy by up to 56% within and across
subpopulations under sparse-data conditions and nonlinearly identifies genes
that GWAS/TWAS fail to uncover. With complete domain knowledge for a synthetic
metabolomics benchmark, BINN reduces prediction error by 75% relative to
conventional neural nets and correctly identifies the most important nonlinear
pathway. Importantly, both cases show highly sensitive BINN latent variables
correlate with the experimental quantities they represent, despite not being
trained on them. This suggests BINNs learn biologically-relevant
representations, nonlinear or linear, from genotype to phenotype. Together,
BINNs establish a framework that leverages intermediate domain information to
improve genomic prediction accuracy and reveal nonlinear biological
relationships that can guide genomic selection, candidate gene selection,
pathway enrichment, and gene-editing prioritization.

Motivation: 传统少步扩散模型存在师生模型格式不匹配问题，导致复杂的蒸馏过程和质量-多样性权衡

Method: 修改学生流模型的输出层，预测网络无关策略，通过策略产生动态流速度，使用模仿蒸馏方法匹配教师模型行为

Result: 在ImageNet 256²上达到1-NFE FID 2.85，优于相同DiT架构的MeanFlow；在FLUX.1-12B和Qwen-Image-20B上4 NFEs时获得更好的多样性

Conclusion: π-Flow通过简单模仿教师行为实现稳定可扩展训练，避免质量-多样性权衡，在少步生成任务中表现优异

Abstract: Few-step diffusion or flow-based generative models typically distill a
velocity-predicting teacher into a student that predicts a shortcut towards
denoised data. This format mismatch has led to complex distillation procedures
that often suffer from a quality-diversity trade-off. To address this, we
propose policy-based flow models ($\pi$-Flow). $\pi$-Flow modifies the output
layer of a student flow model to predict a network-free policy at one timestep.
The policy then produces dynamic flow velocities at future substeps with
negligible overhead, enabling fast and accurate ODE integration on these
substeps without extra network evaluations. To match the policy's ODE
trajectory to the teacher's, we introduce a novel imitation distillation
approach, which matches the policy's velocity to the teacher's along the
policy's trajectory using a standard $\ell_2$ flow matching loss. By simply
mimicking the teacher's behavior, $\pi$-Flow enables stable and scalable
training and avoids the quality-diversity trade-off. On ImageNet 256$^2$, it
attains a 1-NFE FID of 2.85, outperforming MeanFlow of the same DiT
architecture. On FLUX.1-12B and Qwen-Image-20B at 4 NFEs, $\pi$-Flow achieves
substantially better diversity than state-of-the-art few-step methods, while
maintaining teacher-level quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 模型有效性对决策过程至关重要，但传统方法依赖预定义的有效性框架，这些框架可能不可用或不充分。

Method: DOTechnique通过评估替代模型是否与高保真模型产生等效决策来确定模型有效性，整合领域约束和符号推理来缩小搜索空间。

Result: 以高速公路变道系统为例，展示了DOTechnique能够揭示仿真模型的有效性区域。

Conclusion: 该技术有潜力通过决策者上下文来支持寻找模型有效性。

Abstract: Model validity is as critical as the model itself, especially when guiding
decision-making processes. Traditional approaches often rely on predefined
validity frames, which may not always be available or sufficient. This paper
introduces the Decision Oriented Technique (DOTechnique), a novel method for
determining model validity based on decision consistency rather than output
similarity. By evaluating whether surrogate models lead to equivalent decisions
compared to high-fidelity models, DOTechnique enables efficient identification
of validity regions, even in the absence of explicit validity boundaries. The
approach integrates domain constraints and symbolic reasoning to narrow the
search space, enhancing computational efficiency. A highway lane change system
serves as a motivating example, demonstrating how DOTechnique can uncover the
validity region of a simulation model. The results highlight the potential of
the technique to support finding model validity through decision-maker context.

Abstract: State-of-the-art (SOTA) Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems primarily
rely on acoustic information while disregarding additional multi-modal context.
However, visual information are essential in disambiguation and adaptation.
While most work focus on speaker images to handle noise conditions, this work
also focuses on integrating presentation slides for the use cases of scientific
presentation.
  In a first step, we create a benchmark for multi-modal presentation including
an automatic analysis of transcribing domain-specific terminology. Next, we
explore methods for augmenting speech models with multi-modal information. We
mitigate the lack of datasets with accompanying slides by a suitable approach
of data augmentation. Finally, we train a model using the augmented dataset,
resulting in a relative reduction in word error rate of approximately 34%,
across all words and 35%, for domain-specific terms compared to the baseline

Motivation: 探讨大型语言模型是否会在经典的认知科学范式——列联判断任务中产生因果幻觉，这种认知偏差被认为是许多社会问题的基础。

Method: 构建了1000个医学背景下的零相关情境数据集，在这些情境中可用信息不足以建立变量间的因果关系，然后提示LLMs评估潜在原因的有效性。

Result: 所有评估的模型都系统性地推断出无根据的因果关系，显示出对因果幻觉的强烈易感性。

Conclusion: 研究结果支持LLMs只是复制因果语言而非真正理解因果关系的假设，并对在需要准确因果推理的领域中使用语言模型提出了担忧。

Abstract: Causal learning is the cognitive process of developing the capability of
making causal inferences based on available information, often guided by
normative principles. This process is prone to errors and biases, such as the
illusion of causality, in which people perceive a causal relationship between
two variables despite lacking supporting evidence. This cognitive bias has been
proposed to underlie many societal problems, including social prejudice,
stereotype formation, misinformation, and superstitious thinking. In this work,
we examine whether large language models are prone to developing causal
illusions when faced with a classic cognitive science paradigm: the contingency
judgment task. To investigate this, we constructed a dataset of 1,000 null
contingency scenarios (in which the available information is not sufficient to
establish a causal relationship between variables) within medical contexts and
prompted LLMs to evaluate the effectiveness of potential causes. Our findings
show that all evaluated models systematically inferred unwarranted causal
relationships, revealing a strong susceptibility to the illusion of causality.
While there is ongoing debate about whether LLMs genuinely understand causality
or merely reproduce causal language without true comprehension, our findings
support the latter hypothesis and raise concerns about the use of language
models in domains where accurate causal reasoning is essential for informed
decision-making.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法需要特定领域的神经网络架构且难以扩展，GammaZero旨在开发一个统一的图表示框架，实现跨问题规模的泛化能力。

Method: 将信念状态系统性地转换为动作中心图，使用图神经网络和编码器-解码器架构从小规模问题中学习价值函数和策略，然后应用这些学习到的启发式来指导大规模问题的蒙特卡洛树搜索。

Result: 在标准POMDP基准测试中，GammaZero在与BetaZero相同规模问题上表现相当，同时能够零样本泛化到训练时未见过的2-4倍大规模问题，保持解质量的同时减少搜索需求。

Conclusion: GammaZero通过动作中心图表示框架成功实现了POMDP规划中的跨规模泛化，为可扩展的规划学习提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce an action-centric graph representation framework for learning to
guide planning in Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs).
Unlike existing approaches that require domain-specific neural architectures
and struggle with scalability, GammaZero leverages a unified graph-based belief
representation that enables generalization across problem sizes within a
domain. Our key insight is that belief states can be systematically transformed
into action-centric graphs where structural patterns learned on small problems
transfer to larger instances. We employ a graph neural network with a decoder
architecture to learn value functions and policies from expert demonstrations
on computationally tractable problems, then apply these learned heuristics to
guide Monte Carlo tree search on larger problems. Experimental results on
standard POMDP benchmarks demonstrate that GammaZero achieves comparable
performance to BetaZero when trained and tested on the same-sized problems,
while uniquely enabling zero-shot generalization to problems 2-4 times larger
than those seen during training, maintaining solution quality with reduced
search requirements.

Result: 研究表明，使用这些较小模型开发的安全和可解释性方法能有效推广到前沿规模系统，显著降低监管负担并加速安全进展。

Conclusion: 这种授权承诺以最小额外成本显著促进公共利益，并说明对模型的更深入理解能够缓解安全与创新的权衡，实现两者兼得。

Abstract: Recent proposals for regulating frontier AI models have sparked concerns
about the cost of safety regulation, and most such regulations have been
shelved due to the safety-innovation tradeoff. This paper argues for an
alternative regulatory approach that ensures AI safety while actively promoting
innovation: mandating that large AI laboratories release small, openly
accessible analog models (scaled-down versions) trained similarly to and
distilled from their largest proprietary models.
  Analog models serve as public proxies, allowing broad participation in safety
verification, interpretability research, and algorithmic transparency without
forcing labs to disclose their full-scale models. Recent research demonstrates
that safety and interpretability methods developed using these smaller models
generalize effectively to frontier-scale systems. By enabling the wider
research community to directly investigate and innovate upon accessible
analogs, our policy substantially reduces the regulatory burden and accelerates
safety advancements.
  This mandate promises minimal additional costs, leveraging reusable resources
like data and infrastructure, while significantly contributing to the public
good. Our hope is not only that this policy be adopted, but that it illustrates
a broader principle supporting fundamental research in machine learning: deeper
understanding of models relaxes the safety-innovation tradeoff and lets us have
more of both.

### [336] [Generating Fair Consensus Statements with Social Choice on Token-Level MDPs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14106)
*Carter Blair,Kate Larson*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于多目标马尔可夫决策过程的共识声明生成框架，通过社会选择理论提供可证明的公平性保证，包括基于比例公平的随机生成策略和基于平等福利的搜索算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型共识声明生成框架缺乏结构化方法来提供可证明的公平性保证，无法在聚合多样化自由形式意见时确保公平性。

Method: 将任务建模为多目标、令牌级的马尔可夫决策过程，每个目标对应一个智能体的偏好。基于社会选择理论提出两种方法：一是保证处于事前核心的随机生成策略，二是使用搜索算法最大化平等福利来生成单一声明。

Result: 实验表明，基于平等福利目标的搜索算法生成的共识声明在智能体对齐的最坏情况下优于基线方法，包括Habermas Machine。

Conclusion: 该框架为共识声明生成提供了可证明的公平性保证，将社会选择理论原则应用于文本生成任务，在公平性和共识质量方面表现出优势。

Abstract: Current frameworks for consensus statement generation with large language
models lack the inherent structure needed to provide provable fairness
guarantees when aggregating diverse free-form opinions. We model the task as a
multi-objective, token-level Markov Decision Process (MDP), where each
objective corresponds to an agent's preference. Token-level rewards for each
agent are derived from their policy (e.g., a personalized language model). This
approach utilizes the finding that such policies implicitly define optimal
Q-functions, providing a principled way to quantify rewards at each generation
step without a value function (Rafailov et al., 2024). This MDP formulation
creates a formal structure amenable to analysis using principles from social
choice theory. We propose two approaches grounded in social choice theory.
First, we propose a stochastic generation policy guaranteed to be in the
ex-ante core, extending core stability concepts from voting theory to text
generation. This policy is derived from an underlying distribution over
complete statements that maximizes proportional fairness (Nash Welfare).
Second, for generating a single statement, we target the maximization of
egalitarian welfare using search algorithms within the MDP framework.
Empirically, experiments using language models to instantiate agent policies
show that search guided by the egalitarian objective generates consensus
statements with improved worst-case agent alignment compared to baseline
methods, including the Habermas Machine (Tessler et al., 2024).

TL;DR: 提出STEMS框架，一种安全约束的多智能体强化学习方法，用于协调建筑能源管理，通过空间-时间图表示学习和控制障碍函数确保安全运行。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多建筑能源系统中的空间-时间依赖关系利用不足、缺乏严格安全保证和系统复杂性等关键挑战。

Method: 集成GCN-Transformer融合架构的空间-时间图表示学习框架，以及结合控制障碍函数的安全约束多智能体强化学习算法。

Result: 在真实建筑数据集上，STEMS实现21%成本降低、18%排放减少，安全违规从35.1%降至5.6%，仅0.13的不适比例保持最佳舒适度。

Conclusion: STEMS框架在多建筑能源管理中表现出卓越性能，在极端天气条件下具有强鲁棒性，并在不同建筑类型中保持有效性。

Abstract: Building energy management is essential for achieving carbon reduction goals,
improving occupant comfort, and reducing energy costs. Coordinated building
energy management faces critical challenges in exploiting spatial-temporal
dependencies while ensuring operational safety across multi-building systems.
Current multi-building energy systems face three key challenges: insufficient
spatial-temporal information exploitation, lack of rigorous safety guarantees,
and system complexity. This paper proposes Spatial-Temporal Enhanced Safe
Multi-Agent Coordination (STEMS), a novel safety-constrained multi-agent
reinforcement learning framework for coordinated building energy management.
STEMS integrates two core components: (1) a spatial-temporal graph
representation learning framework using a GCN-Transformer fusion architecture
to capture inter-building relationships and temporal patterns, and (2) a
safety-constrained multi-agent RL algorithm incorporating Control Barrier
Functions to provide mathematical safety guarantees. Extensive experiments on
real-world building datasets demonstrate STEMS's superior performance over
existing methods, showing that STEMS achieves 21% cost reduction, 18% emission
reduction, and dramatically reduces safety violations from 35.1% to 5.6% while
maintaining optimal comfort with only 0.13 discomfort proportion. The framework
also demonstrates strong robustness during extreme weather conditions and
maintains effectiveness across different building types.

Conclusion: 该框架为多AI智能体系统的行为推理提供了统一的语义基础，能够预防死锁和安全漏洞，确保系统在关键应用中的安全性和功能性。

Abstract: Agentic AI systems, which leverage multiple autonomous agents and Large
Language Models (LLMs), are increasingly used to address complex, multi-step
tasks. The safety, security, and functionality of these systems are critical,
especially in high-stakes applications. However, the current ecosystem of
inter-agent communication is fragmented, with protocols such as the Model
Context Protocol (MCP) for tool access and the Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocol
for coordination being analyzed in isolation. This fragmentation creates a
semantic gap that prevents the rigorous analysis of system properties and
introduces risks such as architectural misalignment and exploitable
coordination issues. To address these challenges, we introduce a modeling
framework for agentic AI systems composed of two foundational models. The
first, the host agent model, formalizes the top-level entity that interacts
with the user, decomposes tasks, and orchestrates their execution by leveraging
external agents and tools. The second, the task lifecycle model, details the
states and transitions of individual sub-tasks from creation to completion,
providing a fine-grained view of task management and error handling. Together,
these models provide a unified semantic framework for reasoning about the
behavior of multi-AI agent systems. Grounded in this framework, we define 17
properties for the host agent and 14 for the task lifecycle, categorized into
liveness, safety, completeness, and fairness. Expressed in temporal logic,
these properties enable formal verification of system behavior, detection of
coordination edge cases, and prevention of deadlocks and security
vulnerabilities. Through this effort, we introduce the first rigorously
grounded, domain-agnostic framework for the systematic analysis, design, and
deployment of correct, reliable, and robust agentic AI systems.

*David Roqui,Adèle Cormier,nistor Grozavu,Ann Bourges*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种轻量级多模态架构，融合传感器数据和视觉图像来预测文化遗产地的退化严重程度，在数据稀缺情况下实现了76.9%的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文化遗产地因气候变化加速退化，传统单模态监测方法无法捕捉环境压力与材料劣化之间的复杂相互作用。

Method: 基于PerceiverIO的轻量级多模态架构，采用简化编码器（64D潜在空间）防止小数据集过拟合，并使用自适应Barlow Twins损失促进模态互补性。

Result: 在斯特拉斯堡大教堂数据上达到76.9%准确率，比标准多模态架构提升43%，比原始PerceiverIO提升25%。消融研究证实多模态协同效果显著。

Conclusion: 架构简单性与对比正则化相结合，能够在数据稀缺的文化遗产监测环境中实现有效的多模态学习，为AI驱动的保护决策支持系统奠定基础。

Abstract: Cultural heritage sites face accelerating degradation due to climate change,
yet tradi- tional monitoring relies on unimodal analysis (visual inspection or
environmental sen- sors alone) that fails to capture the complex interplay
between environmental stres- sors and material deterioration. We propose a
lightweight multimodal architecture that fuses sensor data (temperature,
humidity) with visual imagery to predict degradation severity at heritage
sites. Our approach adapts PerceiverIO with two key innovations: (1) simplified
encoders (64D latent space) that prevent overfitting on small datasets (n=37
training samples), and (2) Adaptive Barlow Twins loss that encourages modality
complementarity rather than redundancy. On data from Strasbourg Cathedral, our
model achieves 76.9% accu- racy, a 43% improvement over standard multimodal
architectures (VisualBERT, Trans- former) and 25% over vanilla PerceiverIO.
Ablation studies reveal that sensor-only achieves 61.5% while image-only
reaches 46.2%, confirming successful multimodal synergy. A systematic
hyperparameter study identifies an optimal moderate correlation target ({\tau}
=0.3) that balances align- ment and complementarity, achieving 69.2% accuracy
compared to other {\tau} values ({\tau} =0.1/0.5/0.7: 53.8%, {\tau} =0.9:
61.5%). This work demonstrates that architectural sim- plicity combined with
contrastive regularization enables effective multimodal learning in data-scarce
heritage monitoring contexts, providing a foundation for AI-driven con-
servation decision support systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管强化学习研究进展迅速，但在商业视频游戏中的应用仍然缓慢。本文旨在解决游戏AI社区在使用RL驱动NPC时面临的常见挑战，并探索RL与行为树结合的关键节点。

Method: 使用AMD Schola插件在Unreal Engine中训练RL代理，创建多任务NPC。提供了将RL模型与行为树联合训练的详细方法，并在受《最后生还者》启发的复杂3D环境中展示各种技能。

Result: 验证了RL与行为树结合方法的可行性，成功在复杂3D环境中创建了多任务NPC，展示了各种技能。

Conclusion: RL与行为树的结合是一个有前景的方向，虽然之前有研究提出，但实际应用仍然罕见。本文通过实际案例证明了这种方法的实用价值。

Abstract: While the rapid advancements in the reinforcement learning (RL) research
community have been remarkable, the adoption in commercial video games remains
slow. In this paper, we outline common challenges the Game AI community faces
when using RL-driven NPCs in practice, and highlight the intersection of RL
with traditional behavior trees (BTs) as a crucial juncture to be explored
further. Although the BT+RL intersection has been suggested in several research
papers, its adoption is rare. We demonstrate the viability of this approach
using AMD Schola -- a plugin for training RL agents in Unreal Engine -- by
creating multi-task NPCs in a complex 3D environment inspired by the commercial
video game ``The Last of Us". We provide detailed methodologies for jointly
training RL models with BTs while showcasing various skills.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: JEDA是一个用于临床对话中订单检索的双编码器系统，能够直接从对话中检索规范订单，无需依赖LLM重写，提供实时、可解释的订单检索能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床对话包含显性指令和隐性推理，现有系统依赖LLM重写导致延迟、不稳定和不透明，阻碍实时订单处理。

Method: 基于PubMedBERT初始化的双编码器，使用重复安全对比目标进行微调，通过约束LLM指导将不同意图表达对齐到共享订单概念，支持查询和无查询两种模式。

Result: 在实践部署中表现优异，大幅超越基础编码器和最新开源嵌入模型，提供噪声弹性检索能力。

Conclusion: JEDA实现了快速、可解释、无需LLM的检索层，能够实时将环境上下文链接到可操作的临床订单。

Abstract: Clinical conversations mix explicit directives (order a chest X-ray) with
implicit reasoning (the cough worsened overnight, we should check for
pneumonia). Many systems rely on LLM rewriting, adding latency, instability,
and opacity that hinder real-time ordering. We present JEDA (Joint Embedding
for Direct and Ambient clinical orders), a domain-initialized bi-encoder that
retrieves canonical orders directly and, in a query-free mode, encodes a short
rolling window of ambient dialogue to trigger retrieval. Initialized from
PubMedBERT and fine-tuned with a duplicate-safe contrastive objective, JEDA
aligns heterogeneous expressions of intent to shared order concepts. Training
uses constrained LLM guidance to tie each signed order to complementary
formulations (command only, context only, command+context, context+reasoning),
producing clearer inter-order separation, tighter query extendash order
coupling, and stronger generalization. The query-free mode is noise-resilient,
reducing sensitivity to disfluencies and ASR errors by conditioning on a short
window rather than a single utterance. Deployed in practice, JEDA yields large
gains and substantially outperforms its base encoder and recent open embedders
(Linq Embed Mistral, SFR Embedding, GTE Qwen, BGE large, Embedding Gemma). The
result is a fast, interpretable, LLM-free retrieval layer that links ambient
context to actionable clinical orders in real time.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 强化学习算法对奖励函数规范高度敏感，这限制了其广泛应用。需要一种自动化、组合式的奖励设计方法来克服这一挑战。

Method: 使用基础模型从自然语言规范自动生成奖励机器；将语言嵌入与奖励机器状态关联以实现任务间泛化；在多样化环境中进行实证验证。

Result: 在多个具有挑战性的环境中证明了ARM-FM的有效性，包括零样本泛化能力的证据。

Conclusion: ARM-FM通过结合基础模型和奖励机器形式化，为强化学习提供了一种自动化、可组合的奖励设计方法，显著提高了奖励函数设计的效率和泛化能力。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms are highly sensitive to reward
function specification, which remains a central challenge limiting their broad
applicability. We present ARM-FM: Automated Reward Machines via Foundation
Models, a framework for automated, compositional reward design in RL that
leverages the high-level reasoning capabilities of foundation models (FMs).
Reward machines (RMs) -- an automata-based formalism for reward specification
-- are used as the mechanism for RL objective specification, and are
automatically constructed via the use of FMs. The structured formalism of RMs
yields effective task decompositions, while the use of FMs enables objective
specifications in natural language. Concretely, we (i) use FMs to automatically
generate RMs from natural language specifications; (ii) associate language
embeddings with each RM automata-state to enable generalization across tasks;
and (iii) provide empirical evidence of ARM-FM's effectiveness in a diverse
suite of challenging environments, including evidence of zero-shot
generalization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有越狱研究主要关注单轮提示，而真实骚扰通常发生在多轮互动中。需要开发多轮、理论基础的攻击方法来评估LLM代理的安全性。

Method: 构建了包含合成多轮骚扰对话数据集、基于重复博弈理论的多代理模拟、三种越狱攻击方法（针对记忆、规划和微调）以及混合评估框架的基准测试。使用LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct和Gemini-2.0-flash两种模型进行测试。

Result: 微调后的越狱攻击使骚扰成功率大幅提升：Llama模型从57.25-64.19%提升至95.78-96.89%，Gemini模型从98.46%提升至99.33%。最常见的毒性行为是侮辱（84.9-87.8%）和谩骂（81.2-85.1%）。闭源和开源模型显示出不同的升级轨迹。

Conclusion: 多轮和理论基础的攻击不仅成功率高，还能模拟类似人类的骚扰动态，这强调了开发强大安全防护措施的必要性，以确保在线平台的安全和负责任。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents are powering a growing share of interactive
web applications, yet remain vulnerable to misuse and harm. Prior jailbreak
research has largely focused on single-turn prompts, whereas real harassment
often unfolds over multi-turn interactions. In this work, we present the Online
Harassment Agentic Benchmark consisting of: (i) a synthetic multi-turn
harassment conversation dataset, (ii) a multi-agent (e.g., harasser, victim)
simulation informed by repeated game theory, (iii) three jailbreak methods
attacking agents across memory, planning, and fine-tuning, and (iv) a
mixed-methods evaluation framework. We utilize two prominent LLMs,
LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct (open-source) and Gemini-2.0-flash (closed-source). Our
results show that jailbreak tuning makes harassment nearly guaranteed with an
attack success rate of 95.78--96.89% vs. 57.25--64.19% without tuning in Llama,
and 99.33% vs. 98.46% without tuning in Gemini, while sharply reducing refusal
rate to 1-2% in both models. The most prevalent toxic behaviors are Insult with
84.9--87.8% vs. 44.2--50.8% without tuning, and Flaming with 81.2--85.1% vs.
31.5--38.8% without tuning, indicating weaker guardrails compared to sensitive
categories such as sexual or racial harassment. Qualitative evaluation further
reveals that attacked agents reproduce human-like aggression profiles, such as
Machiavellian/psychopathic patterns under planning, and narcissistic tendencies
with memory. Counterintuitively, closed-source and open-source models exhibit
distinct escalation trajectories across turns, with closed-source models
showing significant vulnerability. Overall, our findings show that multi-turn
and theory-grounded attacks not only succeed at high rates but also mimic
human-like harassment dynamics, motivating the development of robust safety
guardrails to ultimately keep online platforms safe and responsible.

Abstract: Deep research -- producing comprehensive, citation-grounded reports by
searching and synthesizing information from hundreds of live web sources --
marks an important frontier for agentic systems. To rigorously evaluate this
ability, four principles are essential: tasks should be (1) user-centric,
reflecting realistic information needs, (2) dynamic, requiring up-to-date
information beyond parametric knowledge, (3) unambiguous, ensuring consistent
interpretation across users, and (4) multi-faceted and search-intensive,
requiring search over numerous web sources and in-depth analysis. Existing
benchmarks fall short of these principles, often focusing on narrow domains or
posing ambiguous questions that hinder fair comparison. Guided by these
principles, we introduce LiveResearchBench, a benchmark of 100 expert-curated
tasks spanning daily life, enterprise, and academia, each requiring extensive,
dynamic, real-time web search and synthesis. Built with over 1,500 hours of
human labor, LiveResearchBench provides a rigorous basis for systematic
evaluation. To evaluate citation-grounded long-form reports, we introduce
DeepEval, a comprehensive suite covering both content- and report-level
quality, including coverage, presentation, citation accuracy and association,
consistency and depth of analysis. DeepEval integrates four complementary
evaluation protocols, each designed to ensure stable assessment and high
agreement with human judgments. Using LiveResearchBench and DeepEval, we
conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 17 frontier deep research systems,
including single-agent web search, single-agent deep research, and multi-agent
systems. Our analysis reveals current strengths, recurring failure modes, and
key system components needed to advance reliable, insightful deep research.

Conclusion: 奖励来源和数据规模是开放领域智能体学习的关键杠杆，多角色协同进化是实现可扩展、自我改进智能体的有效方法。

Abstract: We study whether self-learning can scale LLM-based agents without relying on
human-curated datasets or predefined rule-based rewards. Through controlled
experiments in a search-agent setting, we identify two key determinants of
scalable agent training: the source of reward signals and the scale of agent
task data. We find that rewards from a Generative Reward Model (GRM) outperform
rigid rule-based signals for open-domain learning, and that co-evolving the GRM
with the policy further boosts performance. Increasing the volume of agent task
data-even when synthetically generated-substantially enhances agentic
capabilities. Building on these insights, we propose \textbf{Agentic
Self-Learning} (ASL), a fully closed-loop, multi-role reinforcement learning
framework that unifies task generation, policy execution, and evaluation within
a shared tool environment and LLM backbone. ASL coordinates a Prompt Generator,
a Policy Model, and a Generative Reward Model to form a virtuous cycle of
harder task setting, sharper verification, and stronger solving. Empirically,
ASL delivers steady, round-over-round gains, surpasses strong RLVR baselines
(e.g., Search-R1) that plateau or degrade, and continues improving under
zero-labeled-data conditions, indicating superior sample efficiency and
robustness. We further show that GRM verification capacity is the main
bottleneck: if frozen, it induces reward hacking and stalls progress; continual
GRM training on the evolving data distribution mitigates this, and a small
late-stage injection of real verification data raises the performance ceiling.
This work establishes reward source and data scale as critical levers for
open-domain agent learning and demonstrates the efficacy of multi-role
co-evolution for scalable, self-improving agents. The data and code of this
paper are released at

Abstract: With the advancement of powerful large-scale reasoning models, effectively
evaluating the reasoning capabilities of these models has become increasingly
important. However, existing benchmarks designed to assess the reasoning
abilities of large models tend to be limited in scope and lack the flexibility
to adapt their difficulty according to the evolving reasoning capacities of the
models. To address this, we propose MorphoBench, a benchmark that incorporates
multidisciplinary questions to evaluate the reasoning capabilities of large
models and can adjust and update question difficulty based on the reasoning
abilities of advanced models. Specifically, we curate the benchmark by
selecting and collecting complex reasoning questions from existing benchmarks
and sources such as Olympiad-level competitions. Additionally, MorphoBench
adaptively modifies the analytical challenge of questions by leveraging key
statements generated during the model's reasoning process. Furthermore, it

### [348] [A Guardrail for Safety Preservation: When Safety-Sensitive Subspace Meets Harmful-Resistant Null-Space](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14301)
*Bingjie Zhang,Yibo Yang,Renzhe,Dandan Guo,Jindong Gu,Philip Torr,Bernard Ghanem*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GuardSpace是一个在微调过程中保护大语言模型安全对齐的框架，通过安全敏感子空间和有害抵抗零空间来防止安全行为退化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在微调过程中容易丧失预训练的安全对齐能力，即使使用良性数据或低秩适配也会产生有害响应。

Method: 使用协方差预处理的奇异值分解将预训练权重分解为安全相关和安全无关组件，初始化低秩适配器时冻结安全相关组件，并构建零空间投影器限制适配器更新对有害提示的响应。

Result: 在多个下游任务上的实验表明，GuardSpace优于现有方法。对于Llama-2-7B-Chat在GSM8K上的微调，有害分数从14.4%降至3.6%，准确率从26.0%提升至28.0%。

Conclusion: GuardSpace框架能有效在微调过程中保持模型的安全对齐，同时提升任务性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in diverse
tasks, yet their safety alignment remains fragile during adaptation. Even when
fine-tuning on benign data or with low-rank adaptation, pre-trained safety
behaviors are easily degraded, leading to harmful responses in the fine-tuned
models. To address this challenge, we propose GuardSpace, a guardrail framework
for preserving safety alignment throughout fine-tuning, composed of two key
components: a safety-sensitive subspace and a harmful-resistant null space.
First, we explicitly decompose pre-trained weights into safety-relevant and
safety-irrelevant components using covariance-preconditioned singular value
decomposition, and initialize low-rank adapters from the safety-irrelevant
ones, while freezing safety-relevant components to preserve their associated
safety mechanism. Second, we construct a null space projector that restricts
adapter updates from altering safe outputs on harmful prompts, thereby
maintaining the original refusal behavior. Experiments with various pre-trained
models on multiple downstream tasks demonstrate that GuardSpace achieves
superior performance over existing methods. Notably, for Llama-2-7B-Chat
fine-tuned on GSM8K, GuardSpace outperforms the state-of-the-art method AsFT,
reducing the average harmful score from 14.4% to 3.6%, while improving the
accuracy from from 26.0% to 28.0%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM驱动的多智能体系统能够自动化繁琐的用户任务，但这种设计引入了新的风险，包括错位、恶意方攻击、智能体被破坏或用户数据被盗。

Method: 重新利用多智能体系统中的黑板设计，创建模块化、可配置的测试平台，识别关键攻击向量（错位、恶意智能体、通信被破坏、数据投毒），并实现三个协作MAS场景和四种代表性攻击。

Result: 开发了Terrarium框架，提供了快速原型设计、评估和迭代防御与设计的工具，展示了框架的灵活性。

Conclusion: Terrarium旨在加速可信赖多智能体系统的进展，通过提供工具来研究安全、隐私和安全性问题。

Abstract: A multi-agent system (MAS) powered by large language models (LLMs) can
automate tedious user tasks such as meeting scheduling that requires
inter-agent collaboration. LLMs enable nuanced protocols that account for
unstructured private data, user constraints, and preferences. However, this
design introduces new risks, including misalignment and attacks by malicious
parties that compromise agents or steal user data. In this paper, we propose
the Terrarium framework for fine-grained study on safety, privacy, and security
in LLM-based MAS. We repurpose the blackboard design, an early approach in
multi-agent systems, to create a modular, configurable testbed for multi-agent
collaboration. We identify key attack vectors such as misalignment, malicious
agents, compromised communication, and data poisoning. We implement three
collaborative MAS scenarios with four representative attacks to demonstrate the
framework's flexibility. By providing tools to rapidly prototype, evaluate, and
iterate on defenses and designs, Terrarium aims to accelerate progress toward
trustworthy multi-agent systems.

TL;DR: MASC是一个元认知框架，通过实时无监督的步骤级错误检测和自校正来增强多智能体系统的鲁棒性，防止错误级联传播。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多智能体系统中单个错误步骤会级联传播并破坏整个轨迹的问题，提高系统的稳定性和可靠性。

Method: 采用历史条件异常评分方法，包括：1）下一执行重构，从查询和交互历史预测下一步嵌入以捕捉因果一致性；2）原型引导增强，学习正常步骤嵌入的原型先验以稳定稀疏上下文下的重构和异常评分。

Result: 在Who&When基准测试中，MASC始终优于所有基线方法，步骤级错误检测AUC-ROC提升高达8.47%；在多种MAS框架中都能带来一致的端到端性能提升。

Conclusion: MASC的元认知监控和针对性校正能够以最小开销缓解错误传播，在不同架构中都具有良好的通用性。

Abstract: Large Language Model based multi-agent systems (MAS) excel at collaborative
problem solving but remain brittle to cascading errors: a single faulty step
can propagate across agents and disrupt the trajectory. In this paper, we
present MASC, a metacognitive framework that endows MAS with real-time,
unsupervised, step-level error detection and self-correction. MASC rethinks
detection as history-conditioned anomaly scoring via two complementary designs:
(1) Next-Execution Reconstruction, which predicts the embedding of the next
step from the query and interaction history to capture causal consistency, and
(2) Prototype-Guided Enhancement, which learns a prototype prior over
normal-step embeddings and uses it to stabilize reconstruction and anomaly
scoring under sparse context (e.g., early steps). When an anomaly step is
flagged, MASC triggers a correction agent to revise the acting agent's output
before information flows downstream. On the Who&When benchmark, MASC
consistently outperforms all baselines, improving step-level error detection by
up to 8.47% AUC-ROC ; When plugged into diverse MAS frameworks, it delivers
consistent end-to-end gains across architectures, confirming that our
metacognitive monitoring and targeted correction can mitigate error propagation
with minimal overhead.

Motivation: 现有AI服务多为被动响应，需要用户明确指令。真正的智能助手应能预见用户需求并在适当时机主动提供帮助。

Method: 基于冯·诺依曼架构设计Alpha-Service框架，包含输入单元、中央处理单元、算术逻辑单元、内存单元和输出单元，通过多智能体系统在AI眼镜上实现。

Conclusion: Alpha-Service框架为实现主动式AI服务提供了可行方案，展示了从被动工具向主动伴侣转变的潜力。

Abstract: In an era where AI is evolving from a passive tool into an active and
adaptive companion, we introduce AI for Service (AI4Service), a new paradigm
that enables proactive and real-time assistance in daily life. Existing AI
services remain largely reactive, responding only to explicit user commands. We
argue that a truly intelligent and helpful assistant should be capable of
anticipating user needs and taking actions proactively when appropriate. To
realize this vision, we propose Alpha-Service, a unified framework that
addresses two fundamental challenges: Know When to intervene by detecting
service opportunities from egocentric video streams, and Know How to provide
both generalized and personalized services. Inspired by the von Neumann
computer architecture and based on AI glasses, Alpha-Service consists of five
key components: an Input Unit for perception, a Central Processing Unit for
task scheduling, an Arithmetic Logic Unit for tool utilization, a Memory Unit
for long-term personalization, and an Output Unit for natural human
interaction. As an initial exploration, we implement Alpha-Service through a
multi-agent system deployed on AI glasses. Case studies, including a real-time
Blackjack advisor, a museum tour guide, and a shopping fit assistant,
demonstrate its ability to seamlessly perceive the environment, infer user
intent, and provide timely and useful assistance without explicit prompts.

TL;DR: 提出IP-Merging方法，无需调优即可将数学推理能力从数学LLM直接迁移到多模态LLM，解决了参数空间不对齐的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态LLM在数学推理能力上落后于纯文本LLM，但现有模型融合方法忽视了MLLM与LLM之间的参数空间对齐问题。

Method: IP-Merging方法：识别MLLM和数学LLM中的推理相关参数，将其投影到MLLM子空间，然后在该子空间内合并参数。

Result: 实验表明IP-Merging能有效提升MLLM的数学推理能力，且不损害其他能力。

Conclusion: IP-Merging是一种无需调优的方法，能够成功将数学推理能力从数学LLM迁移到MLLM。

Abstract: Math reasoning has been one crucial ability of large language models (LLMs),
where significant advancements have been achieved in recent years. However,
most efforts focus on LLMs by curating high-quality annotation data and
intricate training (or inference) paradigms, while the math reasoning
performance of multi-modal LLMs (MLLMs) remains lagging behind. Since the MLLM
typically consists of an LLM and a vision block, we wonder: Can MLLMs directly
absorb math reasoning abilities from off-the-shelf math LLMs without tuning?
Recent model-merging approaches may offer insights into this question. However,
they overlook the alignment between the MLLM and LLM, where we find that there
is a large gap between their parameter spaces, resulting in lower performance.
Our empirical evidence reveals two key factors behind this issue: the
identification of crucial reasoning-associated layers in the model and the
mitigation of the gaps in parameter space. Based on the empirical insights, we
propose IP-Merging that first identifies the reasoning-associated parameters in
both MLLM and Math LLM, then projects them into the subspace of MLLM, aiming to
maintain the alignment, and finally merges parameters in this subspace.
IP-Merging is a tuning-free approach since parameters are directly adjusted.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our IP-Merging method can enhance the
math reasoning ability of MLLMs directly from Math LLMs without compromising
their other capabilities.

TL;DR: TITAN是一个连接自然语言网络威胁查询与结构化知识图谱推理的框架，包含路径规划模型和图执行器，支持在MITRE威胁情报上进行双向推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统检索系统无法在威胁情报知识图谱上进行清晰的推理，需要开发能够将自然语言查询转换为可执行推理路径的系统。

Method: 集成路径规划模型预测逻辑关系链，图执行器遍历TITAN本体图检索答案和证据，基于MITRE构建类型化双向图。

Result: 创建了包含88209个示例的TITAN数据集，实证评估显示模型能生成语法有效、语义连贯的可执行推理路径。

Conclusion: TITAN框架成功实现了自然语言威胁查询到结构化知识图谱的确定性推理，为网络威胁情报分析提供了新方法。

Abstract: TITAN (Threat Intelligence Through Automated Navigation) is a framework that
connects natural-language cyber threat queries with executable reasoning over a
structured knowledge graph. It integrates a path planner model, which predicts
logical relation chains from text, and a graph executor that traverses the
TITAN Ontology to retrieve factual answers and supporting evidence. Unlike
traditional retrieval systems, TITAN operates on a typed, bidirectional graph
derived from MITRE, allowing reasoning to move clearly and reversibly between
threats, behaviors, and defenses. To support training and evaluation, we
introduce the TITAN Dataset, a corpus of 88209 examples (Train: 74258; Test:
13951) pairing natural language questions with executable reasoning paths and
step by step Chain of Thought explanations. Empirical evaluations show that
TITAN enables models to generate syntactically valid and semantically coherent
reasoning paths that can be deterministically executed on the underlying graph.

TL;DR: Hi-Agent是一个可训练的分层视觉语言代理，通过高层推理模型和低层动作模型的联合优化，在移动设备控制任务中实现了87.9%的最新SOTA成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的移动设备控制方法大多依赖直接的状态到动作映射，缺乏结构化推理和规划，导致在新任务或未见过的UI布局上泛化能力差。

Method: 提出分层架构，将多步决策重新表述为单步子目标序列，引入前瞻优势函数，利用低层模型的执行反馈指导高层优化，缓解GRPO在长时程任务中的路径爆炸问题。

Result: 在Android-in-the-Wild基准测试中达到87.9%的任务成功率，显著优于基于提示(17.7%)、监督学习(54.5%)和强化学习(71.9%)的方法，并在ScreenSpot-v2上展示了竞争力的零样本泛化能力。

Conclusion: Hi-Agent通过分层设计和联合优化策略，在复杂移动控制场景中表现出强大的适应性和扩展性，为自主移动设备控制提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Building agents that autonomously operate mobile devices has attracted
increasing attention. While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) show promise, most
existing approaches rely on direct state-to-action mappings, which lack
structured reasoning and planning, and thus generalize poorly to novel tasks or
unseen UI layouts. We introduce Hi-Agent, a trainable hierarchical
vision-language agent for mobile control, featuring a high-level reasoning
model and a low-level action model that are jointly optimized. For efficient
training, we reformulate multi-step decision-making as a sequence of
single-step subgoals and propose a foresight advantage function, which
leverages execution feedback from the low-level model to guide high-level
optimization. This design alleviates the path explosion issue encountered by
Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) in long-horizon tasks and enables
stable, critic-free joint training. Hi-Agent achieves a new State-Of-The-Art
(SOTA) 87.9% task success rate on the Android-in-the-Wild (AitW) benchmark,
significantly outperforming prior methods across three paradigms: prompt-based
(AppAgent: 17.7%), supervised (Filtered BC: 54.5%), and reinforcement
learning-based (DigiRL: 71.9%). It also demonstrates competitive zero-shot
generalization on the ScreenSpot-v2 benchmark. On the more challenging
AndroidWorld benchmark, Hi-Agent also scales effectively with larger backbones,
showing strong adaptability in high-complexity mobile control scenarios.

TL;DR: 提出了IMAGINE框架，将多智能体系统的推理规划能力集成到单一紧凑模型中，显著超越传统MAS性能，在TravelPlanner基准上达到82.7%的最终通过率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在复杂推理和规划任务中仍面临挑战，传统多智能体系统虽然能提供更好的集体推理，但存在推理成本高、响应延迟长和端到端训练困难等问题。

Method: 提出IMAGINE框架，通过端到端训练将多智能体系统的推理规划能力集成到单一紧凑模型中，使用Qwen3-8B-Instruct作为基础模型进行训练。

Result: 在TravelPlanner基准测试中，训练后的模型达到82.7%的最终通过率，远超DeepSeek-R1-671B的40%，同时保持更小的模型规模。

Conclusion: IMAGINE框架成功地将多智能体系统的能力集成到单一模型中，不仅获得了结构化推理和规划能力，还显著超越了原始多智能体系统的性能。

Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) have made significant strides across
various tasks, they still face significant challenges in complex reasoning and
planning. For example, even with carefully designed prompts and prior
information explicitly provided, GPT-4o achieves only a 7% Final Pass Rate on
the TravelPlanner dataset in the sole-planning mode. Similarly, even in the
thinking mode, Qwen3-8B-Instruct and DeepSeek-R1-671B, only achieve Final Pass
Rates of 5.9% and 40%, respectively. Although well-organized Multi-Agent
Systems (MAS) can offer improved collective reasoning, they often suffer from
high reasoning costs due to multi-round internal interactions, long
per-response latency, and difficulties in end-to-end training. To address these
challenges, we propose a general and scalable framework called IMAGINE, short
for Integrating Multi-Agent System into One Model. This framework not only
integrates the reasoning and planning capabilities of MAS into a single,
compact model, but also significantly surpass the capabilities of the MAS
through a simple end-to-end training. Through this pipeline, a single
small-scale model is not only able to acquire the structured reasoning and
planning capabilities of a well-organized MAS but can also significantly
outperform it. Experimental results demonstrate that, when using
Qwen3-8B-Instruct as the base model and training it with our method, the model
achieves an 82.7% Final Pass Rate on the TravelPlanner benchmark, far exceeding
the 40% of DeepSeek-R1-671B, while maintaining a much smaller model size.

*Claudia Grundke,Gabriele Röger*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个转换方法，用于消除PDDL公理中派生谓词的负出现，证明这种限制不影响表达能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PDDL标准限制公理体中谓词的负出现只能用于直接由动作设置的谓词，不能用于由公理派生的谓词。但文献中作者经常偏离这一限制，只要求公理集是可分层的。本文旨在证明这两种变体可以表达相同的查询。

Method: 提出了相应的转换方法，通过消除派生谓词的负出现，将允许负出现的可分层公理集转换为符合PDDL标准限制的形式。

Result: 证明了两种变体（PDDL标准限制和可分层的负出现）可以表达完全相同的查询，即最小不动点逻辑所表达的查询。

Conclusion: 负出现的派生谓词可以被消除，PDDL公理的限制不会影响其表达能力，两种方法在表达能力上是等价的。

Abstract: Axioms are a feature of the Planning Domain Definition Language PDDL that can
be considered as a generalization of database query languages such as Datalog.
The PDDL standard restricts negative occurrences of predicates in axiom bodies
to predicates that are directly set by actions and not derived by axioms. In
the literature, authors often deviate from this limitation and only require
that the set of axioms is stratifiable. Both variants can express exactly the
same queries as least fixed-point logic, indicating that negative occurrences
of derived predicates can be eliminated. We present the corresponding
transformation.

Result: 实验表明，Helmsman生成的解决方案与手工构建的基线方法相当甚至更优，并引入了AgentFL-Bench基准进行评估。

Conclusion: 该工作代表了向复杂去中心化AI系统自动化工程迈出的重要一步。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) offers a powerful paradigm for training models on
decentralized data, but its promise is often undermined by the immense
complexity of designing and deploying robust systems. The need to select,
combine, and tune strategies for multifaceted challenges like data
heterogeneity and system constraints has become a critical bottleneck,
resulting in brittle, bespoke solutions. To address this, we introduce
Helmsman, a novel multi-agent system that automates the end-to-end synthesis of
federated learning systems from high-level user specifications. It emulates a
principled research and development workflow through three collaborative
phases: (1) interactive human-in-the-loop planning to formulate a sound
research plan, (2) modular code generation by supervised agent teams, and (3) a
closed-loop of autonomous evaluation and refinement in a sandboxed simulation
environment. To facilitate rigorous evaluation, we also introduce
AgentFL-Bench, a new benchmark comprising 16 diverse tasks designed to assess
the system-level generation capabilities of agentic systems in FL. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach generates solutions competitive with,
and often superior to, established hand-crafted baselines. Our work represents
a significant step towards the automated engineering of complex decentralized
AI systems.

Motivation: 随着AI系统发展，用户期望增加，需要LLM与外部工具交互，但工具数量增加导致提示膨胀，带来高令牌成本、延迟增加和任务成功率降低的问题。

Method: JSPLIT将工具组织成层次化分类学，使用用户提示基于查询和分类结构识别并仅包含最相关工具。

Result: JSPLIT显著减少提示大小，且不影响代理响应能力。当可用工具大幅增加时，JSPLIT甚至提高工具选择准确性，在高度复杂代理环境中降低成本同时提高任务成功率。

Conclusion: JSPLIT框架有效管理提示大小，解决工具数量增加带来的提示膨胀问题，在保持代理性能的同时显著降低成本。

Abstract: AI systems are continually evolving and advancing, and user expectations are
concurrently increasing, with a growing demand for interactions that go beyond
simple text-based interaction with Large Language Models (LLMs). Today's
applications often require LLMs to interact with external tools, marking a
shift toward more complex agentic systems. To support this, standards such as
the Model Context Protocol (MCP) have emerged, enabling agents to access tools
by including a specification of the capabilities of each tool within the
prompt. Although this approach expands what agents can do, it also introduces a
growing problem: prompt bloating. As the number of tools increases, the prompts
become longer, leading to high prompt token costs, increased latency, and
reduced task success resulting from the selection of tools irrelevant to the
prompt. To address this issue, we introduce JSPLIT, a taxonomy-driven framework
designed to help agents manage prompt size more effectively when using large
sets of MCP tools. JSPLIT organizes the tools into a hierarchical taxonomy and
uses the user's prompt to identify and include only the most relevant tools,
based on both the query and the taxonomy structure. In this paper, we describe
the design of the taxonomy, the tool selection algorithm, and the dataset used
to evaluate JSPLIT. Our results show that JSPLIT significantly reduces prompt
size without significantly compromising the agent's ability to respond
effectively. As the number of available tools for the agent grows
substantially, JSPLIT even improves the tool selection accuracy of the agent,
effectively reducing costs while simultaneously improving task success in
high-complexity agent environments.

Conclusion: 这篇概述旨在促进可靠神经符号AI和可信AI模型的开发，通过以易于理解的形式重新阐述高级材料，为处理推理捷径问题提供统一视角。

Abstract: Neuro-symbolic (NeSy) AI aims to develop deep neural networks whose
predictions comply with prior knowledge encoding, e.g. safety or structural
constraints. As such, it represents one of the most promising avenues for
reliable and trustworthy AI. The core idea behind NeSy AI is to combine neural
and symbolic steps: neural networks are typically responsible for mapping
low-level inputs into high-level symbolic concepts, while symbolic reasoning
infers predictions compatible with the extracted concepts and the prior
knowledge. Despite their promise, it was recently shown that - whenever the
concepts are not supervised directly - NeSy models can be affected by Reasoning
Shortcuts (RSs). That is, they can achieve high label accuracy by grounding the
concepts incorrectly. RSs can compromise the interpretability of the model's
explanations, performance in out-of-distribution scenarios, and therefore
reliability. At the same time, RSs are difficult to detect and prevent unless
concept supervision is available, which is typically not the case. However, the
literature on RSs is scattered, making it difficult for researchers and
practitioners to understand and tackle this challenging problem. This overview
addresses this issue by providing a gentle introduction to RSs, discussing
their causes and consequences in intuitive terms. It also reviews and
elucidates existing theoretical characterizations of this phenomenon. Finally,
it details methods for dealing with RSs, including mitigation and awareness
strategies, and maps their benefits and limitations. By reformulating advanced
material in a digestible form, this overview aims to provide a unifying
perspective on RSs to lower the bar to entry for tackling them. Ultimately, we
hope this overview contributes to the development of reliable NeSy and
trustworthy AI models.

Motivation: 随着LLM代理能力的增强，研究其是否能超越智能问题解决工具，成为能够自主规划、设计任务并为模糊目标推理的独立实体。

Method: 在开放式实验环境中增强预训练LLM代理，使其能够生成自己的任务、积累知识并与环境进行广泛交互，然后对结果进行定性研究。

Result: 代理能够可靠地遵循复杂多步指令，跨运行存储和重用信息，提出并解决自己的任务，但对提示设计敏感，容易重复生成任务，无法形成自我表征。

Conclusion: 研究显示了将预训练LLM适应开放式环境的潜力和当前限制，指出了未来在训练代理管理记忆、进行有效探索和追求抽象长期目标方面的方向。

Abstract: Recent LLM agents have made great use of chain of thought reasoning and
function calling. As their capabilities grow, an important question arises: can
this software represent not only a smart problem-solving tool, but an entity in
its own right, that can plan, design immediate tasks, and reason toward
broader, more ambiguous goals? To study this question, we adopt an open-ended
experimental setting where we augment a pretrained LLM agent with the ability
to generate its own tasks, accumulate knowledge, and interact extensively with
its environment. We study the resulting open-ended agent qualitatively. It can
reliably follow complex multi-step instructions, store and reuse information
across runs, and propose and solve its own tasks, though it remains sensitive
to prompt design, prone to repetitive task generation, and unable to form
self-representations. These findings illustrate both the promise and current
limits of adapting pretrained LLMs toward open-endedness, and point to future
directions for training agents to manage memory, explore productively, and
pursue abstract long-term goals.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有移动代理评估标准存在局限性：离线静态基准只能验证单一预定义路径，而在线动态测试受限于真实设备的复杂性和不可重现性，两者都无法全面评估代理能力。

Method: 通过建模真实设备交互中观察到的有限状态，实现动态行为的静态模拟，开发了专注于复杂长任务的ColorBench基准，支持多有效解决方案评估、子任务完成率统计和原子级能力分析。

Result: ColorBench包含175个任务（74个单应用，101个跨应用），平均长度超过13步，每个任务包含至少两条正确路径和若干典型错误路径，通过评估发现现有模型的局限性。

Conclusion: 基于实验结果提出了改进方向和可行的技术路径，以增强代理在复杂长任务问题上的性能。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of multimodal large language models has enabled agents
to operate mobile devices by directly interacting with graphical user
interfaces, opening new possibilities for mobile automation. However,
real-world mobile tasks are often complex and allow for multiple valid
solutions. This contradicts current mobile agent evaluation standards: offline
static benchmarks can only validate a single predefined "golden path", while
online dynamic testing is constrained by the complexity and non-reproducibility
of real devices, making both approaches inadequate for comprehensively
assessing agent capabilities. To bridge the gap between offline and online
evaluation and enhance testing stability, this paper introduces a novel
graph-structured benchmarking framework. By modeling the finite states observed
during real-device interactions, it achieves static simulation of dynamic
behaviors. Building on this, we develop ColorBench, a benchmark focused on
complex long-horizon tasks. It supports evaluation of multiple valid solutions,
subtask completion rate statistics, and atomic-level capability analysis.
ColorBench contains 175 tasks (74 single-app, 101 cross-app) with an average
length of over 13 steps. Each task includes at least two correct paths and
several typical error paths, enabling quasi-dynamic interaction. By evaluating
ColorBench across various baselines, we discover limitations of existing models
and propose improvement directions and feasible technical pathways to enhance
agents' performance on complex, long-horizon problems based on experimental
results. Code and data are available at:

*Rikard Rosenbacke,Carl Rosenbacke,Victor Rosenbacke,Martin McKee*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了Rose-Frame框架，用于诊断人机交互中的认知和认识论漂移，通过三个维度（地图vs领土、直觉vs理性、冲突vs确认）来识别和缓解LLM的幻觉风险，强调将AI对齐重新定义为认知治理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型虽然流畅且情感共鸣强，但基于统计预测而非有根据的推理，存在产生听起来令人信服但缺乏事实有效性的幻觉风险。需要解决LLM操作化System 1认知（快速、联想、有说服力但无反思或证伪）的问题。

Method: 引入Rose-Frame三维框架：(i)地图vs领土区分现实表征与现实本身；(ii)直觉vs理性基于双过程理论分离快速情感判断与慢速反思思维；(iii)冲突vs确认检验思想是通过分歧批判性测试还是仅通过相互验证强化。

Result: Rose-Frame不试图用更多数据或规则修复LLM，而是提供一个反思工具，使模型的局限性和用户的假设可见，实现更透明和批判性意识的AI部署。

Conclusion: 将对齐重新定义为认知治理：无论是人类还是人工的直觉，都必须由人类理性来治理。只有通过嵌入反思性、可证伪的监督，才能将机器的流畅性与人类的理解对齐。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are becoming deeply embedded in human
communication and decision-making, yet they inherit the ambiguity, bias, and
lack of direct access to truth inherent in language itself. While their outputs
are fluent, emotionally resonant, and coherent, they are generated through
statistical prediction rather than grounded reasoning. This creates the risk of
hallucination, responses that sound convincing but lack factual validity.
Building on Geoffrey Hinton's observation that AI mirrors human intuition
rather than reasoning, this paper argues that LLMs operationalize System 1
cognition at scale: fast, associative, and persuasive, but without reflection
or falsification. To address this, we introduce the Rose-Frame, a
three-dimensional framework for diagnosing cognitive and epistemic drift in
human-AI interaction. The three axes are: (i) Map vs. Territory, which
distinguishes representations of reality (epistemology) from reality itself
(ontology); (ii) Intuition vs. Reason, drawing on dual-process theory to
separate fast, emotional judgments from slow, reflective thinking; and (iii)
Conflict vs. Confirmation, which examines whether ideas are critically tested
through disagreement or simply reinforced through mutual validation. Each
dimension captures a distinct failure mode, and their combination amplifies
misalignment. Rose-Frame does not attempt to fix LLMs with more data or rules.
Instead, it offers a reflective tool that makes both the model's limitations
and the user's assumptions visible, enabling more transparent and critically
aware AI deployment. It reframes alignment as cognitive governance: intuition,
whether human or artificial, must remain governed by human reason. Only by
embedding reflective, falsifiable oversight can we align machine fluency with
human understanding.

TL;DR: 本文开发了算法偏倚风险评估工具(RABAT)，用于评估荷兰公共卫生机器学习研究中的算法偏倚，并提出了ACAR四阶段公平性框架来帮助研究人员在机器学习生命周期中解决公平性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器学习在公共卫生领域有巨大潜力，但如果不系统关注算法偏倚，可能会无意中加剧现有的健康不平等。需要评估当前研究中对算法偏倚的识别、讨论和报告情况。

Method: 开发了RABAT工具，整合了Cochrane偏倚风险、PROBAST和微软负责任AI检查表的元素，应用于35篇同行评审研究。基于分析结果提出了ACAR四阶段公平性框架。

Result: 分析显示普遍存在差距：虽然数据采样和缺失数据处理有良好记录，但大多数研究缺乏明确的公平性框架、亚组分析以及对潜在危害的透明讨论。

Conclusion: 提出了针对公共卫生机器学习从业者的可行建议，确保算法创新能够促进健康公平而非削弱它，通过系统考虑算法偏倚和促进透明度。

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) promises to revolutionize public health through
improved surveillance, risk stratification, and resource allocation. However,
without systematic attention to algorithmic bias, ML may inadvertently
reinforce existing health disparities. We present a systematic literature
review of algorithmic bias identification, discussion, and reporting in Dutch
public health ML research from 2021 to 2025. To this end, we developed the Risk
of Algorithmic Bias Assessment Tool (RABAT) by integrating elements from
established frameworks (Cochrane Risk of Bias, PROBAST, Microsoft Responsible
AI checklist) and applied it to 35 peer-reviewed studies. Our analysis reveals
pervasive gaps: although data sampling and missing data practices are well
documented, most studies omit explicit fairness framing, subgroup analyses, and
transparent discussion of potential harms. In response, we introduce a
four-stage fairness-oriented framework called ACAR (Awareness,
Conceptualization, Application, Reporting), with guiding questions derived from
our systematic literature review to help researchers address fairness across
the ML lifecycle. We conclude with actionable recommendations for public health
ML practitioners to consistently consider algorithmic bias and foster
transparency, ensuring that algorithmic innovations advance health equity
rather than undermine it.

Motivation: 传统以人类为中心的AI伦理方法存在局限，NAEL旨在开发不预设人类道德直觉、能适应情境的伦理行为框架。

Method: 结合主动推理和符号推理的神经符号架构，通过最小化全局期望自由能量来形式化伦理行为，在动态多智能体环境中实现伦理推理。

Result: 通过伦理资源分配的案例研究，展示了NAEL能够动态平衡自我保存、认知学习和集体福利。

Conclusion: NAEL为人工智能提供了一种非人类中心主义的伦理框架，能够产生情境敏感、自适应和关系性的伦理行为。

Abstract: We introduce NAEL (Non-Anthropocentric Ethical Logic), a novel ethical
framework for artificial agents grounded in active inference and symbolic
reasoning. Departing from conventional, human-centred approaches to AI ethics,
NAEL formalizes ethical behaviour as an emergent property of intelligent
systems minimizing global expected free energy in dynamic, multi-agent
environments. We propose a neuro-symbolic architecture to allow agents to
evaluate the ethical consequences of their actions in uncertain settings. The
proposed system addresses the limitations of existing ethical models by
allowing agents to develop context-sensitive, adaptive, and relational ethical
behaviour without presupposing anthropomorphic moral intuitions. A case study
involving ethical resource distribution illustrates NAEL's dynamic balancing of
self-preservation, epistemic learning, and collective welfare.

TL;DR: COUP算法配置方法的实用性能改进，使其在保持理论保证的同时达到与启发式配置方法相当的竞争力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: COUP方法虽然具有强大的理论保证，但在实际性能方面关注不足，需要改进其实用性以与广泛使用的启发式配置方法竞争

Method: 提出一系列对COUP的改进措施，在不降低理论保证的前提下提升其经验性能，并通过实验验证这些改进的效果

Result: 改进后的COUP在经验性能上显著提升，能够与无性能保证的启发式配置程序竞争，并通过案例研究展示了算法选择解决方案对效用函数变化的鲁棒性

Conclusion: 通过改进，基于理论的功利主义算法配置方法达到了实用化水平，能够有效处理用户偏好并保持理论保证

Abstract: Utilitarian algorithm configuration identifies a parameter setting for a
given algorithm that maximizes a user's utility. Utility functions offer a
theoretically well-grounded approach to optimizing decision-making under
uncertainty and are flexible enough to capture a user's preferences over
algorithm runtimes (e.g., they can describe a sharp cutoff after which a
solution is no longer required, a per-hour cost for compute, or diminishing
returns from algorithms that take longer to run). COUP is a recently-introduced
utilitarian algorithm configuration procedure which was designed mainly to
offer strong theoretical guarantees about the quality of the configuration it
returns, with less attention paid to its practical performance. This paper
closes that gap, bringing theoretically-grounded, utilitarian algorithm
configuration to the point where it is competitive with widely used, heuristic
configuration procedures that offer no performance guarantees. We present a
series of improvements to COUP that improve its empirical performance without
degrading its theoretical guarantees and demonstrate their benefit
experimentally. Using a case study, we also illustrate ways of exploring the
robustness of a given solution to the algorithm selection problem to variations
in the utility function.

TL;DR: 提出PAVE方法，通过在知识感知子空间中净化任务向量来减少任务无关冗余，提升模型合并性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型合并方法中，任务向量包含任务无关冗余导致性能下降，而随机丢弃参数的方法缺乏知识感知

Method: 使用训练样本获取协方差矩阵，进行上下文导向的奇异值分解，在知识感知子空间中分离任务相关和冗余组件，并引入谱秩分配策略

Result: PAVE作为即插即用方案，在多种合并方法、任务和模型架构中均能有效提升性能

Conclusion: PAVE方法能有效净化任务向量中的冗余信息，显著改善模型合并的性能

Abstract: Model merging aims to integrate task-specific abilities from individually
fine-tuned models into a single model without extra training. In recent model
merging methods, task vector has become a fundamental building block, as it can
encapsulate the residual information from finetuning. However, the merged model
often suffers from notable performance degradation due to the conflicts caused
by task-irrelevant redundancy in task vectors. Existing efforts in overcoming
redundancy by randomly dropping elements in the parameter space involves
randomness and lacks knowledge awareness. To address these challenges, in this
study, we propose Purifying TAsk Vectors (PAVE) in knowledge-aware subspace.
Concretely, we sample some training examples from each task, and feed them into
their corresponding fine-tuned models to acquire the covariance matrices before
linear layers. We then perform a context-oriented singular value decomposition,
which accentuates the weight components most relevant to the target knowledge.
As a result, we can split fine-tuned model weights into task-relevant and
redundant components in the knowledge-aware subspace, and purify the task
vector by pruning the redundant components. To induce fair pruning efforts
across models, we further introduce a spectral rank allocation strategy by
optimizing a normalized activated pruning error. The task vector purification
by our method as a plug-and-play scheme is applicable across various task
vector-based merging methods to improve their performance. In experiments, we
demonstrate the effectiveness of PAVE across a diverse set of merging methods,
tasks, and model architectures.

TL;DR: CoAST是一个用于下一个兴趣点推荐的框架，通过自然语言接口整合世界知识、时空轨迹模式和个人资料，使用两阶段方法：推荐知识获取和认知对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型在POI推荐中缺乏地理实体理解和时空移动模式认知的问题，同时整合世界知识和人类认知对齐以提升推荐性能。

Method: 采用两阶段方法：1) 在去标识化的用户时空轨迹数据上进行持续预训练获取推荐知识；2) 通过监督微调和强化学习实现认知对齐。

Result: 在多个真实数据集上的离线实验和在AMAP应用中的在线实验证明了CoAST的有效性。

Conclusion: CoAST框架能够有效整合世界知识和时空模式，通过认知对齐提升POI推荐性能，在实际应用中表现出良好效果。

Abstract: The next point-of-interest (POI) recommendation task aims to predict the
users' immediate next destinations based on their preferences and historical
check-ins, holding significant value in location-based services. Recently,
large language models (LLMs) have shown great potential in recommender systems,
which treat the next POI prediction in a generative manner. However, these
LLMs, pretrained primarily on vast corpora of unstructured text, lack the
native understanding of structured geographical entities and sequential
mobility patterns required for next POI prediction tasks. Moreover, in
industrial-scale POI prediction applications, incorporating world knowledge and
alignment of human cognition, such as seasons, weather conditions, holidays,
and users' profiles (such as habits, occupation, and preferences), can enhance
the user experience while improving recommendation performance. To address
these issues, we propose CoAST (Cognitive-Aligned Spatial-Temporal LLMs), a
framework employing natural language as an interface, allowing for the
incorporation of world knowledge, spatio-temporal trajectory patterns,
profiles, and situational information. Specifically, CoAST mainly comprises of
2 stages: (1) Recommendation Knowledge Acquisition through continued
pretraining on the enriched spatial-temporal trajectory data of the
desensitized users; (2) Cognitive Alignment to align cognitive judgments with
human preferences using enriched training data through Supervised Fine-Tuning
(SFT) and a subsequent Reinforcement Learning (RL) phase. Extensive offline
experiments on various real-world datasets and online experiments deployed in
"Guess Where You Go" of AMAP App homepage demonstrate the effectiveness of
CoAST.

TL;DR: 提出了一个结合细粒度束搜索和过程奖励模型ToolPRM的推理扩展框架，用于提升大语言模型在结构化输出（如函数调用）任务中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前推理扩展研究主要关注非结构化输出生成任务，而在结构化输出（如函数调用）中的应用研究不足，需要填补这一空白。

Method: 构建了首个细粒度函数调用过程监督数据集，使用函数掩码技术自动标注步骤级奖励，训练ToolPRM过程奖励模型来评分函数调用的内部步骤。

Result: ToolPRM在预测准确性上优于粗粒度和结果奖励模型，配备ToolPRM的推理扩展技术显著提升了骨干模型在各种函数调用任务和基准测试中的性能。

Conclusion: 揭示了将推理扩展技术应用于结构化输出的关键原则："多探索少保留"，这是由于结构化函数调用生成的不可恢复特性决定的。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly demonstrating strong
capabilities as autonomous agents, with function calling serving as a core
mechanism for interaction with the environment. Meanwhile, inference scaling
has become a cutting-edge technique to enhance LLM performance by allocating
more computational resources during the inference process. However, current
research on inference scaling primarily focuses on unstructured output
generation tasks, leaving its application in structured outputs, like function
calling, largely underexplored. To bridge this gap, we propose an inference
scaling framework that combines fine-grained beam search with a process reward
model, ToolPRM, which scores the internal steps of each single function call.
To train ToolPRM, we construct the first fine-grained intra-call process
supervision dataset, automatically annotated with function-masking techniques
to provide step-level rewards for structured tool-use reasoning. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that ToolPRM beats the coarse-grained and outcome
reward models in terms of predictive accuracy, indicating its stronger
capability in supervising the function calling inference process. Inference
scaling technique equipped with ToolPRM also significantly improves the
backbone model performance across various function calling tasks and
benchmarks. More importantly, we reveal a key principle for applying inference
scaling techniques to structured outputs: "explore more but retain less" due to
the unrecoverability characteristics of structured function calling generation.

TL;DR: 论文分析了RLVR方法存在系统性偏向利用而非探索的问题，提出了SimKO方法来缓解概率过度集中，提升探索能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RLVR方法存在系统性偏向利用而非探索的问题，表现为pass@1提升但pass@K(K>1)下降，需要理解并解决这一训练动态问题。

Method: 通过分析token级概率分布，发现概率集中效应，提出SimKO方法：对验证正确的响应提升top-K候选概率，对验证错误的响应惩罚top-1候选，特别在高熵token上应用。

Result: SimKO在各种数学和逻辑推理基准测试中，对广泛的K值范围都能获得更高的pass@K性能。

Conclusion: SimKO通过缓解概率过度集中问题，有效提升了RLVR方法的探索能力，为改进RLVR提供了一种简单有效的方法。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has advanced the
reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). However, prevailing
RLVR methods exhibit a systematic bias toward exploitation over exploration, as
evidenced by improved pass@1 but reduced pass@K (K>1) performance. To
understand this issue, we analyze training dynamics of RLVR methods by tracking
the token-level probability distributions over vocabulary candidates. Our
analysis reveals a consistent probability concentration effect where the top-1
candidate increasingly accumulates probability mass and suppresses that of
other candidates. More importantly, stronger over-concentration correlates with
worse pass@K performance. Inspired by this finding, we propose Simple Pass@K
Optimization (SimKO), a method designed to mitigate the over-concentration
issue, thereby encouraging exploration. SimKO operates in an asymmetrical
manner. For verified-correct responses, it boosts the probabilities of the
top-K candidates. For verified-incorrect responses, it applies stronger
penalties to the top-1 candidate. We observe that this asymmetric design is
particularly effective at mitigating over-concentration when applied at tokens
with high entropy. Across various math and logical-reasoning benchmarks, SimKO
consistently yields higher pass@K for a wide range of K, providing a simple way
to improve RLVR's exploration.

TL;DR: Datalake Agent是一个基于LLM的交互式NL2SQL系统，通过选择性请求必要元信息来大幅减少token使用量和处理成本，同时保持竞争力性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统NL2SQL方法在处理大量数据库元信息时会产生冗长提示和高昂处理成本，需要更高效的解决方案。

Method: 采用代理系统设计，使用交互式循环和推理框架，让LLM选择性请求必要信息来解决表格问答任务，而非一次性使用所有元信息。

Result: 在23个数据库和100个表格问答任务上的评估显示，Datalake Agent将LLM使用的token减少高达87%，显著降低成本同时保持竞争性性能。

Conclusion: Datalake Agent通过选择性信息请求机制有效解决了NL2SQL任务中的高成本问题，为大规模数据库应用提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Translating natural language queries into SQL queries (NL2SQL or Text-to-SQL)
has recently been empowered by large language models (LLMs). Using LLMs to
perform NL2SQL methods on a large collection of SQL databases necessitates
processing large quantities of meta-information about the databases, which in
turn results in lengthy prompts with many tokens and high processing costs. To
address this challenge, we introduce Datalake Agent, an agentic system designed
to enable an LLM to solve NL2SQL tasks more efficiently. Instead of utilizing
direct solvers for NL2SQL that call the LLM once with all meta-information in
the prompt, the Datalake Agent employs an interactive loop to reduce the
utilized meta-information. Within the loop, the LLM is used in a reasoning
framework that selectively requests only the necessary information to solve a
table question answering task. We evaluate the Datalake Agent on a collection
of 23 databases with 100 table question answering tasks. The Datalake Agent
reduces the tokens used by the LLM by up to 87\% and thus allows for
substantial cost reductions while maintaining competitive performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型和视觉语言模型在规划任务中面临常识和推理能力受限的问题，特别是在复杂真实环境中的长视距操作任务表现不佳。

Method: 采用两阶段微调框架：监督训练从专家序列获取基础知识，然后通过强化学习解决模型在视觉空间理解和推理方面的不足。设计了基于规则的奖励函数来同时考虑长视距性能和动作约束。

Result: 在Qwen2.5-VL-3B上训练的推理模型在EmbodiedBench基准测试中显著优于GPT-4o-mini 21.33%，并超过其他在Qwen2.5-VL-7B上训练的工作20.33%。

Conclusion: RoboGPT-R1框架有效提升了具身智能体在复杂环境中的推理和规划能力，证明了监督学习与强化学习结合在机器人任务中的有效性。

Abstract: Improving the reasoning capabilities of embodied agents is crucial for robots
to complete complex human instructions in long-view manipulation tasks
successfully. Despite the success of large language models and vision language
models based on Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) in planning tasks, they continue
facing challenges in performing long-horizon manipulation tasks in complex
real-world environments, owing to their restricted common sense and reasoning
capabilities. Considering that aligning general-purpose vision language models
to robotic planning tasks via supervised fine-tuning suffers from poor
generalization and insufficient physical understanding, we propose RoboGPT-R1,
a two-stage fine-tuning framework for embodied planning. In this framework,
supervised training acquires foundational knowledge through expert sequences,
followed by RL to address the model's shortcomings in visual-spatial
understanding and reasoning. To achieve physical understanding and action
sequence consistency in multi-step reasoning tasks, we design a rule-based
reward function that simultaneously considers long-horizon performance and
action constraint in the environment. The reasoning model, trained on
Qwen2.5-VL-3B, significantly outperforms the larger-scale model, GPT-4o-mini,
by 21.33% and surpasses other work trained on Qwen2.5-VL-7B by 20.33% on the
EmbodiedBench benchmark.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Instruction Boosting是一种后生成方法，通过提高LLM对提示指令的遵循率，解决了单纯添加指令无法保证指令被实际遵循的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发人员通常通过精心操作提示来影响LLM行为，但仅仅添加更多指令并不能保证它们会被实际遵循，需要提高指令遵循的可靠性。

Method: 引入Instruction Boosting作为后生成方法，并创建SCALEDIF基准测试，该基准包含最多十个指令的数据样本。还开发了定量冲突评分工具来分析指令间的紧张和冲突。

Result: Instruction Boosting将两个指令的遵循率提高了7个百分点，十个指令的遵循率提高了4个百分点。分析显示性能下降与指令数量增加导致的冲突程度相关。

Conclusion: Instruction Boosting能有效提高LLM对多指令的遵循可靠性，冲突评分工具可为开发者提供关于额外提示指令对模型性能影响的反馈。

Abstract: A typical approach developers follow to influence an LLM's behavior in an
application is through careful manipulation of the prompt, such as by adding or
modifying instructions. However, merely adding more instructions provides
little assurance that they will actually be followed. We introduce Instruction
Boosting as a post-generation method to increase the reliability of LLM prompt
instructions. We show that Instruction Boosting improves the instruction
following rate by up to 7 points for two instructions and up to 4 points for
ten instructions. To demonstrate these results we introduce SCALEDIF, a
benchmark with a scaled instruction volume of up to ten instructions per data
sample. We also present an analysis of the commonly observed trend that
performance degrades as more instructions are added. We show that an important
factor contributing to this trend is the degree of tension and conflict that
arises as the number of instructions is increased. We contribute a quantitative
conflict scoring tool that explains the observed performance trends and
provides feedback to developers on the impact that additional prompt
instructions have on a model's performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然基于LLM的生成-过滤-精炼迭代范式在推理、编程和科学AI中取得进展，但搜索效果取决于如何将领域先验编码为操作化结构化的假设空间。

Method: 将智能体表示为输入输出的模糊关系算子来捕捉可行转换，通过单一延续参数加权所有可达路径得到覆盖生成函数，从而诱导可达性难度的度量。

Result: 提供了最简单的可测试推断，并通过多数投票实例进行验证，为测量智能体及其搜索空间提供了可行的语言和操作工具。

Conclusion: 该理论为LLM构建的迭代搜索提供了系统的形式化描述，能够衡量智能体和搜索空间，为领域先验指导的搜索提供了理论基础。

Abstract: The generate-filter-refine (iterative paradigm) based on large language
models (LLMs) has achieved progress in reasoning, programming, and program
discovery in AI+Science. However, the effectiveness of search depends on where
to search, namely, how to encode the domain prior into an operationally
structured hypothesis space. To this end, this paper proposes a compact formal
theory that describes and measures LLM-assisted iterative search guided by
domain priors. We represent an agent as a fuzzy relation operator on inputs and
outputs to capture feasible transitions; the agent is thereby constrained by a
fixed safety envelope. To describe multi-step reasoning/search, we weight all
reachable paths by a single continuation parameter and sum them to obtain a
coverage generating function; this induces a measure of reachability
difficulty; and it provides a geometric interpretation of search on the graph
induced by the safety envelope. We further provide the simplest testable
inferences and validate them via a majority-vote instantiation. This theory
offers a workable language and operational tools to measure agents and their
search spaces, proposing a systematic formal description of iterative search
constructed by LLMs.

### [375] [The Gatekeeper Knows Enough](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14881)
*Fikresilase Wondmeneh Abebayew*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了Gatekeeper Protocol框架，通过潜在状态表示和按需请求高保真上下文来解决LLM代理的上下文窗口限制和状态同步问题，显著提高了代理的可靠性和计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM作为自主代理部署时面临上下文窗口有限、状态不同步等限制，导致输出不可靠、行为不可预测、资源使用效率低下，特别是在与代码库和文档等结构化知识系统交互时。

Method: 引入Gatekeeper Protocol框架，要求代理首先在最小化的低保真"潜在状态"表示上进行操作和推理，然后按需策略性地请求高保真上下文。所有交互通过统一的JSON格式进行中介，作为声明性、状态同步的协议。

Result: 通过Sage（软件开发的参考实现）证明该方法显著提高了代理可靠性，通过最小化token消耗改善了计算效率，并实现了与复杂系统的可扩展交互。

Conclusion: Gatekeeper Protocol为在任何结构化知识领域构建更稳健、可预测和基于现实的AI代理提供了基础方法论。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as autonomous agents,
yet their practical utility is fundamentally constrained by a limited context
window and state desynchronization resulting from the LLMs' stateless nature
and inefficient context management. These limitations lead to unreliable
output, unpredictable behavior, and inefficient resource usage, particularly
when interacting with large, structured, and sensitive knowledge systems such
as codebases and documents. To address these challenges, we introduce the
Gatekeeper Protocol, a novel, domain-agnostic framework that governs
agent-system interactions. Our protocol mandates that the agent first operate
and reason on a minimalist, low-fidelity "latent state" representation of the
system to strategically request high-fidelity context on demand. All
interactions are mediated through a unified JSON format that serves as a
declarative, state-synchronized protocol, ensuring the agent's model of the
system remains verifiably grounded in the system's reality. We demonstrate the
efficacy of this protocol with Sage, a reference implementation of the
Gatekeeper Protocol for software development. Our results show that this
approach significantly increases agent reliability, improves computational
efficiency by minimizing token consumption, and enables scalable interaction
with complex systems, creating a foundational methodology for building more
robust, predictable, and grounded AI agents for any structured knowledge
domain.

*Wen-Kwang Tsao,Yao-Ching Yu,Chien-Ming Huang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于强化学习的智能体，能够在没有标签数据或模型权重更新的情况下自我改进，通过生成针对性网络搜索查询来收集外部证据，迭代优化企业日志的模式映射准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 企业智能平台需要集成来自众多第三方供应商的日志，但供应商文档在测试时往往不可用、不匹配、格式混乱或不完整，这使得模式映射变得困难。

Method: 使用强化学习智能体，在推理时：1)识别模糊的字段映射尝试；2)生成针对性网络搜索查询收集外部证据；3)应用基于置信度的奖励迭代优化映射。

Result: 将Microsoft Defender for Endpoint日志转换为通用模式，映射准确率从56.4%(仅LLM)提升到72.73%(RAG)再到93.94%(100次迭代后)，同时将需要专家审查的低置信度映射减少了85%。

Conclusion: 该方法为未来行业问题提供了证据驱动、透明的解决方案，为更鲁棒、可问责、可扩展、高效、灵活、自适应和协作的解决方案铺平了道路。

Abstract: The Enterprise Intelligence Platform must integrate logs from numerous
third-party vendors in order to perform various downstream tasks. However,
vendor documentation is often unavailable at test time. It is either misplaced,
mismatched, poorly formatted, or incomplete, which makes schema mapping
challenging. We introduce a reinforcement learning agent that can self-improve
without labeled examples or model weight updates. During inference, the agent:
1) Identifies ambiguous field-mapping attempts. 2) Generates targeted
web-search queries to gather external evidence. 3) Applies a confidence-based
reward to iteratively refine its mappings. To demonstrate this concept, we
converted Microsoft Defender for Endpoint logs into a common schema. Our method
increased mapping accuracy from 56.4\%(LLM-only) to 72.73\%(RAG) to 93.94\%
over 100 iterations using GPT-4o. At the same time, it reduced the number of
low-confidence mappings requiring expert review by 85\%. This new approach
provides an evidence-driven, transparent method for solving future industry
problems, paving the way for more robust, accountable, scalable, efficient,
flexible, adaptable, and collaborative solutions.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种预算感知的判别式验证方法，结合自一致性机制，在固定计算预算下显著优于生成式验证方法，在AIME2025上达到15.3%的准确率提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的生成式验证器虽然性能优秀但计算成本过高，限制了实际应用。需要寻找更高效的验证策略。

Method: 采用判别式验证器与自一致性相结合的混合方法，在固定计算预算下进行测试时扩展。

Result: 在固定计算预算下，该混合方法比最先进的生成式验证方法表现更好，在AIME2025上准确率提升高达15.3%。

Conclusion: 对于实际应用，基于判别式验证器的预算感知扩展不仅是自一致性的"免费"升级，而且是比昂贵生成式技术更有效和高效的替代方案。

Abstract: Test-time scaling is a powerful strategy for boosting the performance of
large language models on complex reasoning tasks. While state-of-the-art
approaches often employ generative verifiers to select the best solution from a
pool of candidates, this method incurs prohibitive computational costs,
limiting its practicality. In this work, we shift the focus to a more
budget-aware paradigm: discriminative verification. We conduct a thorough
empirical analysis and demonstrate that while discriminative verifiers may
underperform in isolation, combining them with self-consistency in a hybrid
approach creates a powerful and efficient test-time scaling mechanism. Notably,
under a fixed compute budget, this hybrid approach surpasses state-of-the-art
generative verification by a significant margin: achieving up to 15.3\% higher
accuracy on AIME2025. Our findings establish that for practical, real-world
applications, budget-aware scaling with discriminative verifiers is not only a
"free" upgrade over self-consistency, but also a more effective and efficient
alternative to costly generative techniques. Code is available at

TL;DR: 本文系统研究了多模态抑郁症检测，比较了EEG、语音和文本特征表示与建模策略，发现三模态组合能提升检测性能，预训练嵌入优于手工特征，精心设计的三模态模型达到最先进水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有抑郁症自动检测研究存在范围有限、缺乏特征系统比较、评估协议不一致等问题，需要系统探索多模态特征表示和建模策略。

Method: 系统评估手工特征与预训练嵌入、不同神经编码器效果、单模态/双模态/三模态配置、融合策略，特别关注EEG作用，使用一致的受试者独立分割确保可复现性。

Result: EEG、语音和文本三模态组合增强多模态检测性能；预训练嵌入优于手工特征；精心设计的三模态模型达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: 本研究为未来多模态抑郁症检测研究奠定了基础，证明了多模态融合的有效性和预训练嵌入的优越性。

Abstract: Depression is a widespread mental health disorder, yet its automatic
detection remains challenging. Prior work has explored unimodal and multimodal
approaches, with multimodal systems showing promise by leveraging complementary
signals. However, existing studies are limited in scope, lack systematic
comparisons of features, and suffer from inconsistent evaluation protocols. We
address these gaps by systematically exploring feature representations and
modelling strategies across EEG, together with speech and text. We evaluate
handcrafted features versus pre-trained embeddings, assess the effectiveness of
different neural encoders, compare unimodal, bimodal, and trimodal
configurations, and analyse fusion strategies with attention to the role of
EEG. Consistent subject-independent splits are applied to ensure robust,
reproducible benchmarking. Our results show that (i) the combination of EEG,
speech and text modalities enhances multimodal detection, (ii) pretrained
embeddings outperform handcrafted features, and (iii) carefully designed
trimodal models achieve state-of-the-art performance. Our work lays the
groundwork for future research in multimodal depression detection.

*Akira Okutomi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 将康德的《纯粹理性批判》重新解释为反馈稳定性理论，提出复合不稳定性指数(H-Risk)来量化推理系统的过自信问题，并在LLMs中发现脆弱内部动态与错误校准相关


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 建立康德哲学中的理性自我限制与反馈控制理论之间的结构性桥梁，为诊断和减少推理系统的过自信提供原则性视角

Method: 提出复合不稳定性指数H-Risk（结合谱边界、条件数、时间敏感性和创新放大），在线性高斯模拟和大型语言模型中进行验证

Result: 在模拟中，高H-Risk预测过自信错误；在LLMs中，脆弱内部动态与错误校准和幻觉相关，批判式提示对校准和幻觉有混合效果

Conclusion: 揭示了名义稳定性与认知稳定性之间的差距，为理解推理系统的过自信问题提供了新的理论框架和诊断工具

Abstract: We reinterpret Kant's Critique of Pure Reason as a theory of feedback
stability, viewing reason as a regulator that keeps inference within the bounds
of possible experience. We formalize this intuition via a composite instability
index (H-Risk) combining spectral margin, conditioning, temporal sensitivity,
and innovation amplification. In linear-Gaussian simulations, higher H-Risk
predicts overconfident errors even under formal stability, revealing a gap
between nominal and epistemic stability. Extending to large language models
(LLMs), we find that fragile internal dynamics correlate with miscalibration
and hallucination, while critique-style prompts show mixed effects on
calibration and hallucination. These results suggest a structural bridge
between Kantian self-limitation and feedback control, offering a principled
lens for diagnosing -- and selectively reducing -- overconfidence in reasoning
systems. This is a preliminary version; supplementary experiments and broader
replication will be reported in a future revision.

*Yao Zhang,Yu Wu,Haowei Zhang,Weiguo Li,Haokun Chen,Jingpei Wu,Guohao Li,Zhen Han,Volker Tresp*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GroundedPRM是一个基于树搜索和外部工具验证的自动过程监督框架，通过MCTS构建结构化推理路径，使用外部工具验证中间步骤，结合步骤级验证和全局结果评估，仅用10%的数据就实现了比现有方法更好的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的过程奖励模型(PRMs)面临三个核心挑战：噪声奖励、低事实保真度以及与步骤级推理目标的不对齐。这些挑战源于缺乏可扩展的高质量标注，现有方法依赖昂贵的人工标注、易产生幻觉的LLM自评估或存在信用分配问题的蒙特卡洛估计。

Method: 1. 使用蒙特卡洛树搜索(MCTS)构建结构化推理路径，减少奖励噪声并实现细粒度信用分配；2. 通过外部工具验证每个中间步骤，提供执行基础的正确性信号；3. 设计混合奖励聚合机制，融合工具验证和MCTS反馈；4. 将奖励信号格式化为增强推理的生成结构，提高可解释性。

Result: 仅使用40K自动标注样本(最佳自动标注PRM数据量的10%)，在ProcessBench上实现了高达26%的相对性能提升。在奖励引导的贪婪搜索中，甚至超越了使用人工标注监督训练的PRMs。

Conclusion: GroundedPRM提供了一个可扩展且可验证的路径，能够实现高质量的过程级推理，解决了现有PRMs在奖励噪声、事实保真度和步骤对齐方面的核心限制。

Abstract: Process Reward Models (PRMs) aim to improve multi-step reasoning in Large
Language Models (LLMs) by supervising intermediate steps and identifying
errors. However, building effective PRMs remains challenging due to the lack of
scalable, high-quality annotations. Existing approaches rely on costly human
labeling, LLM-based self-evaluation that is prone to hallucination, or Monte
Carlo (MC) estimation, which infers step quality solely from rollout outcomes
and often introduces noisy, misaligned supervision due to credit
misattribution. These issues result in three core limitations: noisy rewards,
low factual fidelity, and misalignment with step-level reasoning objectives. To
address these challenges, we introduce GroundedPRM, a tree-guided and
fidelity-aware framework for automatic process supervision. To reduce reward
noise and enable fine-grained credit assignment, we construct structured
reasoning paths via Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). To eliminate hallucinated
supervision, we validate each intermediate step using an external tool,
providing execution-grounded correctness signals. To combine both step-level
validation and global outcome assessment, we design a hybrid reward aggregation
mechanism that fuses tool-based verification with MCTS-derived feedback.
Finally, we format the reward signal into a rationale-enhanced, generative
structure to promote interpretability and compatibility with instruction-tuned
LLMs. GroundedPRM is trained on only 40K automatically labeled samples,
amounting to just 10% of the data used by the best-performing PRM trained with
auto-labeled supervision. Nevertheless, it achieves up to a 26% relative
improvement in average performance on ProcessBench. When used for reward-guided
greedy search, GroundedPRM outperforms even PRMs trained with human-labeled
supervision, offering a scalable and verifiable path toward high-quality
process-level reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索大型语言模型是否能够学习创造性设计，特别是在组合式机器设计领域，这是人类智能的重要标志和工程实践的基础。

Method: 引入BesiegeField测试平台，基于Besiege游戏构建，支持基于部件的构造、物理模拟和奖励驱动评估。使用代理工作流对最先进的LLMs进行基准测试，并探索强化学习微调作为改进路径。

Result: 当前开源模型在空间推理、战略组装和指令遵循等关键能力上表现不足，通过强化学习微调实验展示了改进潜力。

Conclusion: 该研究揭示了语言、机器设计和物理推理交叉领域的关键挑战，为LLMs在创造性设计任务中的进一步发展提供了方向。

Abstract: The design of complex machines stands as both a marker of human intelligence
and a foundation of engineering practice. Given recent advances in large
language models (LLMs), we ask whether they, too, can learn to create. We
approach this question through the lens of compositional machine design: a task
in which machines are assembled from standardized components to meet functional
demands like locomotion or manipulation in a simulated physical environment. To
support this investigation, we introduce BesiegeField, a testbed built on the
machine-building game Besiege, which enables part-based construction, physical
simulation and reward-driven evaluation. Using BesiegeField, we benchmark
state-of-the-art LLMs with agentic workflows and identify key capabilities
required for success, including spatial reasoning, strategic assembly, and
instruction-following. As current open-source models fall short, we explore
reinforcement learning (RL) as a path to improvement: we curate a cold-start
dataset, conduct RL finetuning experiments, and highlight open challenges at
the intersection of language, machine design, and physical reasoning.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了统一的多模态假内容检测框架UMFDet，能够同时处理人工制作和AI生成的虚假内容，解决了现有方法只能处理单一类型虚假内容的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体上的虚假多模态内容日益增多，包括人工制作的虚假信息和AI生成的内容。现有研究通常孤立处理这两种类型，但在真实场景中内容类型未知，限制了专业系统的有效性。

Method: 构建了OmniFake数据集（12.7万样本），提出UMFDet框架：使用VLM骨干网络，结合类别感知的MoE适配器捕获类别特定线索，以及归因思维链机制提供隐式推理指导。

Result: 大量实验表明UMFDet在两种虚假信息类型上都实现了稳健一致的性能，优于专业基线方法。

Conclusion: UMFDet为真实世界的多模态欺骗检测提供了实用解决方案，能够有效处理未知类型的虚假内容。

Abstract: In recent years, detecting fake multimodal content on social media has drawn
increasing attention. Two major forms of deception dominate: human-crafted
misinformation (e.g., rumors and misleading posts) and AI-generated content
produced by image synthesis models or vision-language models (VLMs). Although
both share deceptive intent, they are typically studied in isolation. NLP
research focuses on human-written misinformation, while the CV community
targets AI-generated artifacts. As a result, existing models are often
specialized for only one type of fake content. In real-world scenarios,
however, the type of a multimodal post is usually unknown, limiting the
effectiveness of such specialized systems. To bridge this gap, we construct the
Omnibus Dataset for Multimodal News Deception (OmniFake), a comprehensive
benchmark of 127K samples that integrates human-curated misinformation from
existing resources with newly synthesized AI-generated examples. Based on this
dataset, we propose Unified Multimodal Fake Content Detection (UMFDet), a
framework designed to handle both forms of deception. UMFDet leverages a VLM
backbone augmented with a Category-aware Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Adapter to
capture category-specific cues, and an attribution chain-of-thought mechanism
that provides implicit reasoning guidance for locating salient deceptive
signals. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UMFDet achieves robust and
consistent performance across both misinformation types, outperforming
specialized baselines and offering a practical solution for real-world
multimodal deception detection.

*François Durand*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 本文分析了三种主要投票规则（多数制、两轮制和即时决选投票）在联盟操纵下的脆弱性，发现IRV在偏好集中度临界值θ_c=0时对联盟操纵具有抵抗力，这主要归因于超级孔多塞赢家的存在。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 先前研究表明IRV对联盟操纵具有高度抵抗力，但其理论原因尚不清楚。本文旨在填补这一空白，分析三种主要投票规则在扰动文化模型中对联盟操纵的敏感性。

Method: 使用扰动文化模型分析三种投票规则（多数制、两轮制和IRV）对联盟操纵的敏感性，引入超级孔多塞赢家概念来理解IRV的抵抗力。

Result: 每种规则在偏好集中度临界值θ_c处经历相变：在大规模选民中，联盟操纵概率在θ_c以下指数收敛到1，在θ_c以上指数收敛到0。IRV的θ_c=0，使其即使在最小偏好集中度下也对联盟操纵具有抵抗力。

Conclusion: IRV对联盟操纵的抵抗力主要归因于超级孔多塞赢家的存在，其临界值θ_c=0使其在理论上对联盟操纵具有高度抵抗力。

Abstract: Previous studies have shown that Instant-Runoff Voting (IRV) is highly
resistant to coalitional manipulation (CM), though the theoretical reasons for
this remain unclear. To address this gap, we analyze the susceptibility to CM
of three major voting rules-Plurality, Two-Round System, and IRV-within the
Perturbed Culture model. Our findings reveal that each rule undergoes a phase
transition at a critical value theta\_c of the concentration of preferences:
the probability of CM for large electorates converges exponentially fast to 1
below theta\_c and to 0 above theta\_c. We introduce the Super Condorcet Winner
(SCW), showing that its presence is a key factor of IRV's resistance to
coalitional manipulation, both theoretically and empirically. Notably, we use
this notion to prove that for IRV, theta\_c = 0, making it resistant to CM with
even minimal preference concentration.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单个利益相关者无法承担MEC等新服务的大规模投资成本，需要多个利益相关者共同投资。

Method: 采用基于鲁棒博弈理论的新型随机联盟博弈公式，推导大联盟稳定性的概率下界，并使用盈利性作为联合投资的必要条件。

Result: 当服务提供商的收益规模相似且投资周期足够长时，即使存在高度不确定性，也能获得较高的稳定性概率下界。但在收益高度波动时，稳定性下界可能很低，但联合投资仍然有利可图。

Conclusion: 所提出的联合投资框架在MEC部署中有效，能够在不确定性条件下确保联盟的稳定性和盈利性。

Abstract: The introduction of new services, such as Mobile Edge Computing (MEC),
requires a massive investment that cannot be assumed by a single stakeholder,
for instance the Infrastructure Provider (InP). Service Providers (SPs) however
also have an interest in the deployment of such services. We hence propose a
co-investment scheme in which all stakeholders, i.e., the InP and the SPs, form
the so-called grand coalition composed of all the stakeholders with the aim of
sharing costs and revenues and maximizing their payoffs. The challenge comes
from the fact that future revenues are uncertain. We devise in this case a
novel stochastic coalitional game formulation which builds upon robust game
theory and derive a lower bound on the probability of the stability of the
grand coalition, wherein no player can be better off outside of it. In the
presence of some correlated fluctuations of revenues however, stability can be
too conservative. In this case, we make use also of profitability, in which
payoffs of players are non-negative, as a necessary condition for
co-investment. The proposed framework is showcased for MEC deployment, where
computational resources need to be deployed in nodes at the edge of a
telecommunication network. Numerical results show high lower bound on the
probability of stability when the SPs' revenues are of similar magnitude and
the investment period is sufficiently long, even with high levels of
uncertainty. In the case where revenues are highly variable however, the lower
bound on stability can be trivially low whereas co-investment is still
profitable.

Abstract: In blockchain networks, the strategic ordering of transactions within blocks
has emerged as a significant source of profit extraction, known as Maximal
Extractable Value (MEV). The transition from spam-based Priority Gas Auctions
to structured auction mechanisms like Polygon Atlas has transformed MEV
extraction from public bidding wars into sealed-bid competitions under extreme
time constraints. While this shift reduces network congestion, it introduces
complex strategic challenges where searchers must make optimal bidding
decisions within a sub-second window without knowledge of competitor behavior
or presence. Traditional game-theoretic approaches struggle in this
high-frequency, partially observable environment due to their reliance on
complete information and static equilibrium assumptions. We present a
reinforcement learning framework for MEV extraction on Polygon Atlas and make
three contributions: (1) A novel simulation environment that accurately models
the stochastic arrival of arbitrage opportunities and probabilistic competition
in Atlas auctions; (2) A PPO-based bidding agent optimized for real-time
constraints, capable of adaptive strategy formulation in continuous action
spaces while maintaining production-ready inference speeds; (3) Empirical
validation demonstrating our history-conditioned agent captures 49\% of
available profits when deployed alongside existing searchers and 81\% when
replacing the market leader, significantly outperforming static bidding
strategies. Our work establishes that reinforcement learning provides a
critical advantage in high-frequency MEV environments where traditional
optimization methods fail, offering immediate value for industrial participants
and protocol designers alike.

TL;DR: 该论文首次研究在线席位分配问题，提出了无未来信息的动态比例分配框架，分析了确定性和随机性在线分配方法的最优偏差界限及其存在条件。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统席位分配被视为一次性过程，但许多实际场景需要考虑动态因素。本文旨在研究在线环境下的席位分配问题，其中算法需要在每个时间步不可撤销地分配席位，而不知道未来的投票分布。

Method: 引入在线比例分配框架，时间离散，n个政党在每个时间步获得一定投票份额。算法需确保每个政党获得的累计席位与其累计份额的偏差最小。研究了确定性和随机性方法，包括贪心算法和基于递归网络流的构造方法。

Result: 确定性方法存在线性于n的最坏偏差下界，贪心算法达到最优；全局配额方法仅当n≤3时存在。随机性方法在n≤3时可实现全局配额且期望比例公平。

Conclusion: 在线席位分配存在基本限制，确定性方法偏差不可避免，但随机性方法在小规模情况下可提供更强保证。结果可应用于在线依赖舍入程序。

Abstract: Traditionally, the problem of apportioning the seats of a legislative body
has been viewed as a one-shot process with no dynamic considerations. While
this approach is reasonable for some settings, dynamic aspects play an
important role in many others. We initiate the study of apportionment problems
in an online setting. Specifically, we introduce a framework for proportional
apportionment with no information about the future. In this model, time is
discrete and there are $n$ parties that receive a certain share of the votes at
each time step. An online algorithm needs to irrevocably assign a prescribed
number of seats at each time, ensuring that each party receives its fractional
share rounded up or down, and that the cumulative number of seats allocated to
each party remains close to its cumulative share up to that time.
  We study deterministic and randomized online apportionment methods. For
deterministic methods, we construct a family of adversarial instances that
yield a lower bound, linear in $n$, on the worst-case deviation between the
seats allocated to a party and its cumulative share. We show that this bound is
best possible and is matched by a natural greedy method. As a consequence, a
method guaranteeing that the cumulative number of seats assigned to each party
up to any step equals its cumulative share rounded up or down (global quota)
exists if and only if $n\leq 3$. Then, we turn to randomized allocations and
show that, for $n\leq 3$, we can randomize over methods satisfying global quota
with the additional guarantee that each party receives, in expectation, its
proportional share in every step. Our proof is constructive: Any method
satisfying these properties can be obtained from a flow on a recursively
constructed network. We showcase the applicability of our results to obtain
approximate solutions in the context of online dependent rounding procedures.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了博弈学习中非渐近稳定性动态，通过统一稳定性概念连接个体效用寻求动态与集体理性经济特性。研究发现，在温和非退化条件下，混合均衡的统一稳定性与弱帕累托最优性密切相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩展博弈学习研究到非渐近稳定性动态，探索个体效用寻求行为如何导致集体理性结果，填补严格均衡动态可能导致社会低效解的研究空白。

Method: 使用统一稳定性概念分析混合纳什均衡，在非退化条件下研究战略等价性，并分析增量平滑最佳响应动态族的最后迭代收敛行为。

Result: 发现混合均衡如果不是统一稳定的，则不是弱帕累托最优的；如果局部统一稳定，则必须是弱帕累托最优的。统一稳定性决定了增量平滑最佳响应动态的收敛行为。

Conclusion: 个体效用寻求行为在混合纳什均衡附近会导致集体理性，这与严格均衡动态可能稳定到社会低效解形成对比，揭示了博弈动态中个体与集体理性之间的重要联系。

Abstract: We extend the study of learning in games to dynamics that exhibit
non-asymptotic stability. We do so through the notion of uniform stability,
which is concerned with equilibria of individually utility-seeking dynamics.
Perhaps surprisingly, it turns out to be closely connected to economic
properties of collective rationality. Under mild non-degeneracy conditions and
up to strategic equivalence, if a mixed equilibrium is not uniformly stable,
then it is not weakly Pareto optimal: there is a way for all players to improve
by jointly deviating from the equilibrium. On the other hand, if it is locally
uniformly stable, then the equilibrium must be weakly Pareto optimal. Moreover,
we show that uniform stability determines the last-iterate convergence behavior
for the family of incremental smoothed best-response dynamics, used to model
individual and corporate behaviors in the markets. Unlike dynamics around
strict equilibria, which can stabilize to socially-inefficient solutions,
individually utility-seeking behaviors near mixed Nash equilibria lead to
collective rationality.

*Juhyeong Kim,Yejin Kim,Youngbin Lee,Hyunwoo Byun*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: FinAI Data Assistant使用LLM和OpenAI Function Calling API实现金融数据库的自然语言查询，通过预定义参数化查询而非生成完整SQL，在可靠性、延迟和成本方面优于text-to-SQL方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统text-to-SQL方法在金融数据库查询中存在的可靠性、延迟和成本问题，提供更实用的自然语言查询方案。

Method: 结合大型语言模型和OpenAI Function Calling API，将用户请求路由到经过验证的参数化查询库，而非生成完整SQL语句。

Result: LLM单独预测存在显著误差和前瞻偏差；股票代码映射准确率很高；FinAI Data Assistant在延迟、成本和可靠性方面优于text-to-SQL基线。

Conclusion: 该方法在金融数据库查询任务中实现了更好的性能权衡，为实际部署提供了可行方案。

Abstract: We present FinAI Data Assistant, a practical approach for natural-language
querying over financial databases that combines large language models (LLMs)
with the OpenAI Function Calling API. Rather than synthesizing complete SQL via
text-to-SQL, our system routes user requests to a small library of vetted,
parameterized queries, trading generative flexibility for reliability, low
latency, and cost efficiency. We empirically study three questions: (RQ1)
whether LLMs alone can reliably recall or extrapolate time-dependent financial
data without external retrieval; (RQ2) how well LLMs map company names to stock
ticker symbols; and (RQ3) whether function calling outperforms text-to-SQL for
end-to-end database query processing. Across controlled experiments on prices
and fundamentals, LLM-only predictions exhibit non-negligible error and show
look-ahead bias primarily for stock prices relative to model knowledge cutoffs.
Ticker-mapping accuracy is near-perfect for NASDAQ-100 constituents and high
for S\&P~500 firms. Finally, FinAI Data Assistant achieves lower latency and
cost and higher reliability than a text-to-SQL baseline on our task suite. We
discuss design trade-offs, limitations, and avenues for deployment.

TL;DR: LinkedIn开发了一种基于LLaMA 3大语言模型的检索系统，通过双编码器生成高质量的用户和内容嵌入，显著提升了推荐系统性能，特别是在新用户留存方面。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在LinkedIn Feed等大规模推荐系统中，检索阶段需要从数亿候选内容中快速筛选出2000个候选，延迟预算仅几毫秒，QPS高达数千。传统方法难以满足这种高吞吐量、低延迟的需求。

Method: 使用Meta的LLaMA 3大语言模型作为双编码器，仅使用文本输入生成用户和内容的嵌入表示。包括提示设计、大规模微调技术以及低延迟在线服务基础设施。

Result: 通过离线指标和在线A/B测试验证，系统显著提升了用户参与度，特别是在网络连接较弱的新用户中表现突出，表明高质量的建议内容有助于用户留存。

Conclusion: 这项工作证明了生成式语言模型可以有效地适应工业应用中的实时高吞吐量检索需求，为大规模推荐系统提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: In large scale recommendation systems like the LinkedIn Feed, the retrieval
stage is critical for narrowing hundreds of millions of potential candidates to
a manageable subset for ranking. LinkedIn's Feed serves suggested content from
outside of the member's network (based on the member's topical interests),
where 2000 candidates are retrieved from a pool of hundreds of millions
candidate with a latency budget of a few milliseconds and inbound QPS of
several thousand per second. This paper presents a novel retrieval approach
that fine-tunes a large causal language model (Meta's LLaMA 3) as a dual
encoder to generate high quality embeddings for both users (members) and
content (items), using only textual input. We describe the end to end pipeline,
including prompt design for embedding generation, techniques for fine-tuning at
LinkedIn's scale, and infrastructure for low latency, cost effective online
serving. We share our findings on how quantizing numerical features in the
prompt enables the information to get properly encoded in the embedding,
facilitating greater alignment between the retrieval and ranking layer. The
system was evaluated using offline metrics and an online A/B test, which showed
substantial improvements in member engagement. We observed significant gains
among newer members, who often lack strong network connections, indicating that
high-quality suggested content aids retention. This work demonstrates how
generative language models can be effectively adapted for real time, high
throughput retrieval in industrial applications.

TL;DR: 提出CoCo框架，通过动态构建用户特定上下文知识嵌入，实现语义和行为潜在维度的深度融合，提升推荐系统的准确性和个性化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于静态模式提示的方法存在两个主要限制：(1) 使用通用模板结构，忽略了用户偏好的多样性；(2) 语义知识表示与行为特征空间的浅层对齐，未能实现全面的潜在空间整合。

Method: CoCo是一个端到端框架，通过双机制方法动态构建用户特定上下文知识嵌入，包括自适应知识融合和矛盾解决模块，实现语义和行为潜在维度的深度融合。

Result: 在多样化基准数据集和企业级电商平台上的实验评估显示，CoCo在推荐准确性上比七种前沿方法最大提升8.58%。在生产广告系统中的部署实现了1.91%的销售增长。

Conclusion: CoCo通过模块化设计和模型无关架构，为需要知识增强推理和个性化适应的下一代推荐系统提供了通用解决方案。

Abstract: The integration of large language models (LLMs) into recommendation systems
has revealed promising potential through their capacity to extract world
knowledge for enhanced reasoning capabilities. However, current methodologies
that adopt static schema-based prompting mechanisms encounter significant
limitations: (1) they employ universal template structures that neglect the
multi-faceted nature of user preference diversity; (2) they implement
superficial alignment between semantic knowledge representations and behavioral
feature spaces without achieving comprehensive latent space integration. To
address these challenges, we introduce CoCo, an end-to-end framework that
dynamically constructs user-specific contextual knowledge embeddings through a
dual-mechanism approach. Our method realizes profound integration of semantic
and behavioral latent dimensions via adaptive knowledge fusion and
contradiction resolution modules. Experimental evaluations across diverse
benchmark datasets and an enterprise-level e-commerce platform demonstrate
CoCo's superiority, achieving a maximum 8.58% improvement over seven
cutting-edge methods in recommendation accuracy. The framework's deployment on
a production advertising system resulted in a 1.91% sales growth, validating
its practical effectiveness. With its modular design and model-agnostic
architecture, CoCo provides a versatile solution for next-generation
recommendation systems requiring both knowledge-enhanced reasoning and
personalized adaptation.

TL;DR: 提出了大型推理嵌入模型（LREM），通过将推理过程整合到表示学习中，解决密集检索中语义准确性不足的问题，显著提高了困难查询的检索准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有密集检索模型虽然使用LLM生成嵌入，但仍采用直接嵌入方法，语义准确性不足，且倾向于捕获训练数据中的统计共现模式，对词汇差异大的困难查询性能显著下降。

Method: 采用两阶段训练：第一阶段通过SFT和InfoNCE损失在精心构建的Query-CoT-Item三元组上优化LLM，建立初步推理和嵌入能力；第二阶段通过强化学习进一步优化推理轨迹。

Result: 离线和在线实验验证了LREM的有效性，自2025年8月起已在中国最大的电商平台部署。

Conclusion: LREM通过集成推理过程到表示学习中，有效弥合了原始查询与目标商品之间的语义鸿沟，显著提升了检索准确性。

Abstract: In modern e-commerce search systems, dense retrieval has become an
indispensable component. By computing similarities between query and item
(product) embeddings, it efficiently selects candidate products from
large-scale repositories. With the breakthroughs in large language models
(LLMs), mainstream embedding models have gradually shifted from BERT to LLMs
for more accurate text modeling. However, these models still adopt
direct-embedding methods, and the semantic accuracy of embeddings remains
inadequate. Therefore, contrastive learning is heavily employed to achieve
tight semantic alignment between positive pairs. Consequently, such models tend
to capture statistical co-occurrence patterns in the training data, biasing
them toward shallow lexical and semantic matches. For difficult queries
exhibiting notable lexical disparity from target items, the performance
degrades significantly. In this work, we propose the Large Reasoning Embedding
Model (LREM), which novelly integrates reasoning processes into representation
learning. For difficult queries, LREM first conducts reasoning to achieve a
deep understanding of the original query, and then produces a
reasoning-augmented query embedding for retrieval. This reasoning process
effectively bridges the semantic gap between original queries and target items,
significantly improving retrieval accuracy. Specifically, we adopt a two-stage
training process: the first stage optimizes the LLM on carefully curated
Query-CoT-Item triplets with SFT and InfoNCE losses to establish preliminary
reasoning and embedding capabilities, and the second stage further refines the
reasoning trajectories via reinforcement learning (RL). Extensive offline and
online experiments validate the effectiveness of LREM, leading to its
deployment on China's largest e-commerce platform since August 2025.

Motivation: 由于CRAG-MM基准测试中的错误答案会导致负分，团队策略专注于减少视觉语言模型内部表示产生的幻觉，以提高整体得分。

Method: 使用隐藏状态和特定注意力头输出训练基于逻辑回归的幻觉检测模型，并采用这些模型的集成方法。

Result: 该方法虽然牺牲了一些正确答案，但显著减少了幻觉，最终在最终排行榜上获得前五名的成绩。

Conclusion: 通过幻觉检测模型的集成策略可以有效减少VLM的幻觉问题，在需要高准确性的VQA任务中具有实用价值。

Abstract: This paper presents the 5th place solution by our team, y3h2, for the Meta
CRAG-MM Challenge at KDD Cup 2025. The CRAG-MM benchmark is a visual question
answering (VQA) dataset focused on factual questions about images, including
egocentric images. The competition was contested based on VQA accuracy, as
judged by an LLM-based automatic evaluator. Since incorrect answers result in
negative scores, our strategy focused on reducing hallucinations from the
internal representations of the VLM. Specifically, we trained logistic
regression-based hallucination detection models using both the hidden_state and
the outputs of specific attention heads. We then employed an ensemble of these
models. As a result, while our method sacrificed some correct answers, it
significantly reduced hallucinations and allowed us to place among the top
entries on the final leaderboard. For implementation details and code, please

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多兴趣推荐中的两个关键问题：兴趣塌陷（多个表示同质化）和兴趣演化建模不足（难以捕捉用户历史行为中不存在的潜在兴趣）。

Method: 提出GemiRec框架，包含三个模块：兴趣字典维护模块（IDMM）维护共享量化兴趣字典；多兴趣后验分布模块（MIPDM）使用生成模型捕捉用户未来兴趣分布；多兴趣检索模块（MIRM）使用多个用户兴趣表示进行物品检索。

Result: 理论和实证分析以及大量实验证明了该方法的优势和有效性，已于2025年3月部署到生产环境，显示了在工业应用中的实际价值。

Conclusion: GemiRec通过框架级改进有效解决了多兴趣推荐中的关键挑战，实现了结构化的兴趣分离和显式的兴趣演化建模，在理论和实践中都表现出色。

Abstract: Multi-interest recommendation has gained attention, especially in industrial
retrieval stage. Unlike classical dual-tower methods, it generates multiple
user representations instead of a single one to model comprehensive user
interests. However, prior studies have identified two underlying limitations:
the first is interest collapse, where multiple representations homogenize. The
second is insufficient modeling of interest evolution, as they struggle to
capture latent interests absent from a user's historical behavior. We begin
with a thorough review of existing works in tackling these limitations. Then,
we attempt to tackle these limitations from a new perspective. Specifically, we
propose a framework-level refinement for multi-interest recommendation, named
GemiRec. The proposed framework leverages interest quantization to enforce a
structural interest separation and interest generation to learn the evolving
dynamics of user interests explicitly. It comprises three modules: (a) Interest
Dictionary Maintenance Module (IDMM) maintains a shared quantized interest
dictionary. (b) Multi-Interest Posterior Distribution Module (MIPDM) employs a
generative model to capture the distribution of user future interests. (c)
Multi-Interest Retrieval Module (MIRM) retrieves items using multiple
user-interest representations. Both theoretical and empirical analyses, as well
as extensive experiments, demonstrate its advantages and effectiveness.
Moreover, it has been deployed in production since March 2025, showing its
practical value in industrial applications.

TL;DR: 提出了MR.Rec框架，通过结合记忆和推理来增强LLM在推荐系统中的能力，解决个性化不足和推理能力有限的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM在推荐系统中面临上下文窗口有限和单轮推理的约束，难以捕捉动态用户偏好和进行主动推理。

Method: 开发了基于RAG的记忆检索系统，集成推理增强的记忆检索，并设计了强化学习框架来训练LLM自主学习记忆利用和推理优化的策略。

Result: 大量实验表明MR.Rec在多个指标上显著优于现有最先进方法，验证了其在提供智能和个性化推荐方面的有效性。

Conclusion: 通过动态记忆检索与自适应推理的结合，MR.Rec能够提供更准确、上下文感知和高度个性化的推荐。

Abstract: The application of Large Language Models (LLMs) in recommender systems faces
key challenges in delivering deep personalization and intelligent reasoning,
especially for interactive scenarios. Current methods are often constrained by
limited context windows and single-turn reasoning, hindering their ability to
capture dynamic user preferences and proactively reason over recommendation
contexts. To address these limitations, we propose MR.Rec, a novel framework
that synergizes memory and reasoning for LLM-based recommendations. To achieve
personalization, we develop a comprehensive Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) system that efficiently indexes and retrieves relevant external memory to
enhance LLM personalization capabilities. Furthermore, to enable the synergy
between memory and reasoning, our RAG system goes beyond conventional
query-based retrieval by integrating reasoning enhanced memory retrieval.
Finally, we design a reinforcement learning framework that trains the LLM to
autonomously learn effective strategies for both memory utilization and
reasoning refinement. By combining dynamic memory retrieval with adaptive
reasoning, this approach ensures more accurate, context-aware, and highly
personalized recommendations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MR.Rec
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across multiple metrics,
validating its efficacy in delivering intelligent and personalized
recommendations. We will release code and data upon paper notification.

TL;DR: 提出CE-CDR框架，通过因果图建模和部分标签因果损失来增强跨域推荐，解决源域任务不一致和因果关系忽视的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统跨域推荐中，源域任务不一致可能导致负迁移，而忽略因果关系会限制源域特征对预测的贡献。需要直接基于因果标签训练跨域表示，但真实因果标签难以获取。

Method: 首先将跨域推荐建模为因果图，启发式构建因果感知数据集，然后推导理论无偏的部分标签因果损失来泛化到未见模式，生成增强的跨域表示用于目标域推荐。

Result: 理论和实证分析证明了CE-CDR的合理性和有效性，可作为模型无关插件通用应用，已于2025年4月部署到生产环境。

Conclusion: CE-CDR是首个探索因果增强跨域推荐的方法，通过因果建模和部分标签损失有效解决了跨域推荐中的关键挑战，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Cross-domain recommendation forms a crucial component in recommendation
systems. It leverages auxiliary information through source domain tasks or
features to enhance target domain recommendations. However, incorporating
inconsistent source domain tasks may result in insufficient cross-domain
modeling or negative transfer. While incorporating source domain features
without considering the underlying causal relationships may limit their
contribution to final predictions. Thus, a natural idea is to directly train a
cross-domain representation on a causality-labeled dataset from the source to
target domain. Yet this direction has been rarely explored, as identifying
unbiased real causal labels is highly challenging in real-world scenarios. In
this work, we attempt to take a first step in this direction by proposing a
causality-enhanced framework, named CE-CDR. Specifically, we first reformulate
the cross-domain recommendation as a causal graph for principled guidance. We
then construct a causality-aware dataset heuristically. Subsequently, we derive
a theoretically unbiased Partial Label Causal Loss to generalize beyond the
biased causality-aware dataset to unseen cross-domain patterns, yielding an
enriched cross-domain representation, which is then fed into the target model
to enhance target-domain recommendations. Theoretical and empirical analyses,
as well as extensive experiments, demonstrate the rationality and effectiveness
of CE-CDR and its general applicability as a model-agnostic plugin. Moreover,
it has been deployed in production since April 2025, showing its practical
value in real-world applications.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了推荐系统数据修剪（移除交互次数少的用户）对数据集特征和算法性能的影响，发现数据修剪会显著改变数据集结构，在修剪数据上训练和测试会人为提升性能，但在未修剪数据上测试时这种优势消失。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 推荐系统研究严重依赖数据集，许多数据集都经过修剪处理（如MovieLens）。本研究旨在分析数据修剪对数据集特征和算法性能的实际影响，特别是评估修剪是否会导致性能结果被人为夸大。

Method: 分析五个基准数据集在未修剪和五个修剪级别（5、10、20、50、100）下的结构分布特征，训练和测试11种代表性算法，并比较在修剪数据上训练但在未修剪数据上测试的性能。

Result: 常用的核心修剪可能高度选择性，某些数据集仅保留2%的原始用户。传统算法在修剪数据上训练和测试时获得更高nDCG@10分数，但在未修剪测试集上这种优势基本消失。所有算法在未修剪数据上测试时，性能随修剪级别增加而下降。

Conclusion: 数据修剪会显著影响推荐算法性能评估，在修剪数据上获得的性能提升可能是人为的，实际应用中应考虑数据集修剪对算法性能的真实影响。

Abstract: Offline evaluations in recommender system research depend heavily on
datasets, many of which are pruned, such as the widely used MovieLens
collections. This thesis examines the impact of data pruning - specifically,
removing users with fewer than a specified number of interactions - on both
dataset characteristics and algorithm performance. Five benchmark datasets were
analysed in both their unpruned form and at five successive pruning levels (5,
10, 20, 50, 100). For each coreset, we examined structural and distributional
characteristics and trained and tested eleven representative algorithms. To
further assess if pruned datasets lead to artificially inflated performance
results, we also evaluated models trained on the pruned train sets but tested
on unpruned data. Results show that commonly applied core pruning can be highly
selective, leaving as little as 2% of the original users in some datasets.
Traditional algorithms achieved higher nDCG@10 scores when both training and
testing on pruned data; however, this advantage largely disappeared when
evaluated on unpruned test sets. Across all algorithms, performance declined
with increasing pruning levels when tested on unpruned data, highlighting the
impact of dataset reduction on the performance of recommender algorithms.

Conclusion: 该工作推进了统一用户建模，在大规模UGC平台中实现了更深层次的个性化，促进了更有意义的用户参与

Abstract: User interests on content platforms are inherently diverse, manifesting
through complex behavioral patterns across heterogeneous scenarios such as
search, feed browsing, and content discovery. Traditional recommendation
systems typically prioritize business metric optimization within isolated
specific scenarios, neglecting cross-scenario behavioral signals and struggling
to integrate advanced techniques like LLMs at billion-scale deployments, which
finally limits their ability to capture holistic user interests across platform
touchpoints. We propose RED-Rec, an LLM-enhanced hierarchical Recommender
Engine for Diversified scenarios, tailored for industry-level content
recommendation systems. RED-Rec unifies user interest representations across
multiple behavioral contexts by aggregating and synthesizing actions from
varied scenarios, resulting in comprehensive item and user modeling. At its
core, a two-tower LLM-powered framework enables nuanced, multifaceted
representations with deployment efficiency, and a scenario-aware dense mixing
and querying policy effectively fuses diverse behavioral signals to capture
cross-scenario user intent patterns and express fine-grained, context-specific
intents during serving. We validate RED-Rec through online A/B testing on
hundreds of millions of users in RedNote through online A/B testing, showing
substantial performance gains in both content recommendation and advertisement
targeting tasks. We further introduce a million-scale sequential recommendation
dataset, RED-MMU, for comprehensive offline training and evaluation. Our work
advances unified user modeling, unlocking deeper personalization and fostering
more meaningful user engagement in large-scale UGC platforms.

Method: 使用亚马逊电商数据集，构建模拟框架来建模推荐系统在周期性重训练过程中的反馈循环，分析不同推荐算法的影响。

Result: 反馈循环存在系统性权衡：增加个体多样性但减少集体多样性，需求集中在少数热门商品上，某些推荐系统会增加用户同质化。

Conclusion: 推荐系统设计需要在个性化与长期多样性之间取得平衡。

Abstract: Recommender systems continuously interact with users, creating feedback loops
that shape both individual behavior and collective market dynamics. This paper
introduces a simulation framework to model these loops in online retail
environments, where recommenders are periodically retrained on evolving
user-item interactions. Using the Amazon e-Commerce dataset, we analyze how
different recommendation algorithms influence diversity, purchase
concentration, and user homogenization over time. Results reveal a systematic
trade-off: while the feedback loop increases individual diversity, it
simultaneously reduces collective diversity and concentrates demand on a few
popular items. Moreover, for some recommender systems, the feedback loop
increases user homogenization over time, making user purchase profiles
increasingly similar. These findings underscore the need for recommender
designs that balance personalization with long-term diversity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型(LLM)开启了"代理时代"，但代理在关键任务应用中表现出脆弱性、不可预测性和不可信性，这源于将概率性处理器与确定性软件工程思维模式不匹配的根本问题。

Method: 引入以治理为先的代理工程范式，提出了名为ArbiterOS的正式架构。

Conclusion: 需要采用治理优先的范式来解决LLM代理工程中的根本性范式不匹配问题。

Abstract: The advent of powerful Large Language Models (LLMs) has ushered in an ``Age
of the Agent,'' enabling autonomous systems to tackle complex goals. However,
the transition from prototype to production is hindered by a pervasive ``crisis
of craft,'' resulting in agents that are brittle, unpredictable, and ultimately
untrustworthy in mission-critical applications. This paper argues this crisis
stems from a fundamental paradigm mismatch -- attempting to command inherently
probabilistic processors with the deterministic mental models of traditional
software engineering. To solve this crisis, we introduce a governance-first
paradigm for principled agent engineering, embodied in a formal architecture we
call ArbiterOS.

Method: 使用合成数据管道将现有单轮任务转换为语义对齐的多轮交互序列，重用原始测试套件同时模拟真实世界编码过程的复杂性。

Result: 评估了32个开源和闭源模型及三种智能体框架，在多轮设置中正确且安全的输出显著下降；在多轮代码差异生成任务中表现更差；智能体框架在多轮评估中效果不如单轮。

Conclusion: 需要能够联合评估多轮真实世界编码工作流中正确性和安全性的基准测试，当前模型在多轮场景中的表现仍有待提升。

Abstract: AI coding assistants powered by large language models (LLMs) have transformed
software development, significantly boosting productivity. While existing
benchmarks evaluate the correctness and security of LLM-generated code, they
are typically limited to single-turn tasks that do not reflect the iterative
nature of real-world development. We introduce MT-Sec, the first benchmark to
systematically evaluate both correctness and security in multi-turn coding
scenarios. We construct this using a synthetic data pipeline that transforms
existing single-turn tasks into semantically aligned multi-turn interaction
sequences, allowing reuse of original test suites while modeling the complexity
of real-world coding processes. We evaluate 32 open- and closed-source models,
and three agent-scaffolding on MT-Sec and observe a consistent 20-27% drop in
"correct and secure" outputs from single-turn to multi-turn settings -- even
among state-of-the-art models. Beyond full-program generation, we also evaluate
models on multi-turn code-diff generation -- an unexplored yet practically
relevant setting -- and find that models perform worse here, with increased
rates of functionally incorrect and insecure outputs. Finally, we find that
while agent scaffoldings boost single-turn code generation performance, they
are not quite as effective in multi-turn evaluations. Together, these findings
highlight the need for benchmarks that jointly evaluate correctness and
security in multi-turn, real-world coding workflows.

*Janghan Yoon,Jaegwan Cho,Junhyeok Kim,Jiwan Chung,Jaehyun Jeon,Youngjae Yu*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: A11yn是首个将代码生成LLM对齐以可靠生成符合可访问性标准的网页UI的方法，通过优化基于WCAG违规的奖励函数，将不可访问率降低了60%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM在生成网页界面时经常复制训练数据中的可访问性缺陷，导致生成的界面无法满足多样化用户需求。

Method: A11yn优化了一个新颖的奖励函数，该函数根据可访问性测试引擎识别的违规严重程度对WCAG违规进行惩罚。构建了UIReq-6.8K数据集用于训练，并引入RealUIReq-300基准进行评估。

Result: 实证结果显示A11yn显著优于强基线，将不可访问率比基础模型降低了60%，同时保持了生成UI的语义保真度和视觉质量。

Conclusion: 研究表明可访问性可以在LLM中系统优化，证明了为可访问性对齐代码生成的可行性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated strong capabilities
in generating functional and aesthetic web interfaces directly from
instructions. However, these models often replicate accessibility flaws from
their training data, resulting in interfaces that exclude users with diverse
needs and contexts. To address this gap, we introduce A11yn, the first method
that aligns code-generating LLMs to reliably produce accessibility-compliant
web UIs. A11yn optimizes a novel reward function that penalizes violations of
the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG), with penalties scaled to the
severity of each violation as identified by an accessibility testing engine. To
support training, we construct UIReq-6.8K, a dataset of 6,800 diverse
instructions for web UI generation. For evaluation, we introduce RealUIReq-300,
a benchmark of 300 real-world web UI requests grounded and manually curated
from public web pages, spanning a broad range of use cases. Empirical results
show that A11yn significantly outperforms strong baselines, lowering the
Inaccessibility Rate by 60% over the base model while preserving semantic
fidelity and visual quality of generated UIs. These findings demonstrate that
accessibility can be systematically optimized within LLMs, showing the
feasibility of aligning code generation for accessibility.

TL;DR: 重新评估谱签名防御方法在代码模型后门攻击检测中的有效性，发现现有设置通常不是最优的，并提出了新的代理指标来更准确评估防御性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在软件开发中的广泛应用，它们成为对抗性攻击的主要目标，特别是后门攻击。虽然谱签名防御方法在神经网络中用于检测中毒数据，但最近研究表明这些方法对代码模型可能不够有效。

Method: 系统评估谱签名防御在不同攻击场景和防御配置下的有效性，分析关键因素的不同设置对性能的影响。

Result: 发现代码后门检测中广泛使用的谱签名设置通常不是最优的，并发现了一个新的代理指标，可以在防御后无需模型重新训练的情况下更准确地估计谱签名的实际性能。

Conclusion: 谱签名防御方法在代码模型后门检测中的应用需要重新评估和优化，新发现的代理指标为更有效的防御评估提供了可能。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into software
development workflows, they also become prime targets for adversarial attacks.
Among these, backdoor attacks are a significant threat, allowing attackers to
manipulate model outputs through hidden triggers embedded in training data.
Detecting such backdoors remains a challenge, and one promising approach is the
use of Spectral Signature defense methods that identify poisoned data by
analyzing feature representations through eigenvectors. While some prior works
have explored Spectral Signatures for backdoor detection in neural networks,
recent studies suggest that these methods may not be optimally effective for
code models. In this paper, we revisit the applicability of Spectral
Signature-based defenses in the context of backdoor attacks on code models. We
systematically evaluate their effectiveness under various attack scenarios and
defense configurations, analyzing their strengths and limitations. We found
that the widely used setting of Spectral Signature in code backdoor detection
is often suboptimal. Hence, we explored the impact of different settings of the
key factors. We discovered a new proxy metric that can more accurately estimate
the actual performance of Spectral Signature without model retraining after the
defense.

TL;DR: BugStone是一个基于LLVM和大型语言模型的程序分析系统，用于检测软件中重复出现的模式错误(RPBs)。该系统利用已修复的错误实例来识别一致的错误模式，然后在整个程序中搜索相似的可能漏洞代码段。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型程序中的错误修复耗时耗力，但修复一个错误后，程序中可能还存在类似代码段包含相同错误但未被发现。这些重复模式错误(RPBs)广泛存在且严重影响软件安全，甚至可能扩大攻击面。

Method: BugStone结合LLVM和大型语言模型，利用已修复的错误实例识别一致错误模式(如特定API误用)，然后在整个程序中搜索包含相似模式的代码段来发现潜在漏洞。

Result: 从135个独特RPBs开始，BugStone在Linux内核中识别出超过22,000个新潜在问题。手动分析400个发现确认246个有效。在包含1.9K安全错误的测试集上，BugStone达到92.2%精确度和79.1%成对准确度。

Conclusion: RPBs在软件中普遍存在且严重影响安全。BugStone证明能够有效检测这类错误，为软件安全提供了实用的自动化检测工具。

Abstract: Fixing bugs in large programs is a challenging task that demands substantial
time and effort. Once a bug is found, it is reported to the project
maintainers, who work with the reporter to fix it and eventually close the
issue. However, across the program, there are often similar code segments,
which may also contain the bug, but were missed during discovery. Finding and
fixing each recurring bug instance individually is labor intensive. Even more
concerning, bug reports can inadvertently widen the attack surface as they
provide attackers with an exploitable pattern that may be unresolved in other
parts of the program.
  In this paper, we explore these Recurring Pattern Bugs (RPBs) that appear
repeatedly across various code segments of a program or even in different
programs, stemming from a same root cause, but are unresolved. Our
investigation reveals that RPBs are widespread and can significantly compromise
the security of software programs. This paper introduces BugStone, a program
analysis system empowered by LLVM and a Large Language Model (LLM). The key
observation is that many RPBs have one patched instance, which can be leveraged
to identify a consistent error pattern, such as a specific API misuse. By
examining the entire program for this pattern, it is possible to identify
similar sections of code that may be vulnerable. Starting with 135 unique RPBs,
BugStone identified more than 22K new potential issues in the Linux kernel.
Manual analysis of 400 of these findings confirmed that 246 were valid. We also
created a dataset from over 1.9K security bugs reported by 23 recent top-tier
conference works. We manually annotate the dataset, identify 80 recurring
patterns and 850 corresponding fixes. Even with a cost-efficient model choice,
BugStone achieved 92.2% precision and 79.1% pairwise accuracy on the dataset.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: NL2Scenic是一个用于评估从自然语言生成Scenic自动驾驶场景代码的数据集和框架，包含146个NL/Scenic对，评估了13个模型，发现EDIT-SIM与人类判断相关性最好，GPT-4o表现最佳，中等规模开源模型是实用且经济的选择。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有NL-to-Scenic生成中数据稀缺、可复现性有限和指标不一致的问题，为自动驾驶场景编程提供标准化评估基准。

Method: 构建包含146个NL/Scenic对的数据集，设计难度分层的30个测试用例，开发示例检索器，评估13个模型（4个专有和9个开源），使用文本指标和执行指标，并与专家研究比较。

Result: EDIT-SIM与人类判断相关性最好，GPT-4o整体表现最佳，Qwen2.5Coder-14B达到GPT-4o专家分数的88%，检索增强提示持续提升小模型性能，中等规模以上模型收益递减。

Conclusion: NL2Scenic和EDIT-COMP为Scenic代码生成提供了标准化、可复现的评估基础，表明中等规模开源模型是自动驾驶场景编程的实用且经济高效的选择。

Abstract: Scenario simulation is central to testing autonomous driving systems. Scenic,
a domain-specific language (DSL) for CARLA, enables precise and reproducible
scenarios, but NL-to-Scenic generation with large language models (LLMs)
suffers from scarce data, limited reproducibility, and inconsistent metrics. We
introduce NL2Scenic, an open dataset and framework with 146 NL/Scenic pairs, a
difficulty-stratified 30-case test split, an Example Retriever, and 14
prompting variants (ZS, FS, CoT, SP, MoT). We evaluate 13 models: four
proprietary (GPT-4o, GPT-5, Claude-Sonnet-4, Gemini-2.5-pro) and nine
open-source code models (Qwen2.5Coder 0.5B-32B; CodeLlama 7B/13B/34B), using
text metrics (BLEU, ChrF, EDIT-SIM, CrystalBLEU) and execution metrics
(compilation and generation), and compare them with an expert study (n=11).
EDIT-SIM correlates best with human judgments; we also propose EDIT-COMP (F1 of
EDIT-SIM and compilation) as a robust dataset-level proxy that improves ranking
fidelity. GPT-4o performs best overall, while Qwen2.5Coder-14B reaches about 88
percent of its expert score on local hardware. Retrieval-augmented prompting,
Few-Shot with Example Retriever (FSER), consistently boosts smaller models, and
scaling shows diminishing returns beyond mid-size, with Qwen2.5Coder
outperforming CodeLlama at comparable scales. NL2Scenic and EDIT-COMP offer a
standardized, reproducible basis for evaluating Scenic code generation and
indicate that mid-size open-source models are practical, cost-effective options
for autonomous-driving scenario programming.

TL;DR: Caruca是一个自动化规范挖掘系统，用于为不透明命令自动生成规范，通过大语言模型翻译文档、探索有效调用空间、系统调用拦截等方式提取命令属性，消除了手动规范创建的需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有系统需要手动创建命令规范，这个过程耗时、易错且限制了系统的实用性，因此需要自动化方法来生成规范。

Method: 使用大语言模型将命令文档翻译为结构化调用语法，探索语法有效的命令调用和执行环境空间，通过系统调用和文件系统拦截提取命令属性如并行性和文件系统前后条件。

Result: 在60个GNU Coreutils、POSIX和第三方命令上测试，Caruca在所有但一个案例中都生成了正确的规范，完全消除了手动工作，并为最先进的静态分析工具提供了完整规范。

Conclusion: Caruca成功实现了自动规范挖掘，能够为各种命令生成可用的规范，显著提高了依赖规范系统的实用性。

Abstract: A wealth of state-of-the-art systems demonstrate impressive improvements in
performance, security, and reliability on programs composed of opaque
components, such as Unix shell commands. To reason about commands, these
systems require partial specifications. However, creating such specifications
is a manual, laborious, and error-prone process, limiting the practicality of
these systems. This paper presents Caruca, a system for automatic specification
mining for opaque commands. To overcome the challenge of language diversity
across commands, Caruca first instruments a large language model to translate a
command's user-facing documentation into a structured invocation syntax. Using
this representation, Caruca explores the space of syntactically valid command
invocations and execution environments. Caruca concretely executes each
command-environment pair, interposing at the system-call and filesystem level
to extract key command properties such as parallelizability and filesystem pre-
and post-conditions. These properties can be exported in multiple specification
formats and are immediately usable by existing systems. Applying Caruca across
60 GNU Coreutils, POSIX, and third-party commands across several
specification-dependent systems shows that Caruca generates correct
specifications for all but one case, completely eliminating manual effort from
the process and currently powering the full specifications for a
state-of-the-art static analysis tool.

TL;DR: 提出了一种混合知识引导进化框架，通过离线分析构建编译知识库，在线阶段使用知识增强的遗传算法为特定程序寻找个性化优化序列，相比-Oz基线平均减少11.0% LLVM IR指令。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 编译器优化序列自动调优是NP难问题，传统通用优化标志如-O3和-Oz采用一刀切方法，往往无法充分发挥程序的性能潜力。

Method: 混合知识引导进化框架：离线阶段构建包含四个关键组件的编译知识库（pass行为向量、pass群组、协同pass图、原型pass序列库）；在线阶段使用知识增强的遗传算法进行个性化优化。

Result: 在七个公共数据集上，相比高度优化的opt -Oz基线，平均额外减少11.0%的LLVM IR指令，展示了在发现个性化高性能优化序列方面的最先进能力。

Conclusion: 该框架通过结合离线知识提取和在线进化搜索，有效解决了编译器优化序列自动调优问题，显著提升了程序性能优化效果。

Abstract: Compiler pass auto-tuning is critical for enhancing software performance, yet
finding the optimal pass sequence for a specific program is an NP-hard problem.
Traditional, general-purpose optimization flags like -O3 and -Oz adopt a
one-size-fits-all approach, often failing to unlock a program's full
performance potential. To address this challenge, we propose a novel Hybrid,
Knowledge-Guided Evolutionary Framework. This framework intelligently guides
online, personalized optimization using knowledge extracted from a large-scale
offline analysis phase. During the offline stage, we construct a comprehensive
compilation knowledge base composed of four key components: (1) Pass Behavioral
Vectors to quantitatively capture the effectiveness of each optimization; (2)
Pass Groups derived from clustering these vectors based on behavior similarity;
(3) a Synergy Pass Graph to model beneficial sequential interactions; and (4) a
library of Prototype Pass Sequences evolved for distinct program types. In the
online stage, a bespoke genetic algorithm leverages this rich knowledge base
through specially designed, knowledge-infused genetic operators. These
operators transform the search by performing semantically-aware recombination
and targeted, restorative mutations. On a suite of seven public datasets, our
framework achieves an average of 11.0% additional LLVM IR instruction reduction
over the highly-optimized opt -Oz baseline, demonstrating its state-of-the-art
capability in discovering personalized, high-performance optimization
sequences.

TL;DR: 本文首次对在线编程中的TLE错误进行大规模实证研究，开发了首个专门针对TLE错误的自动修复工具Nettle及其评估框架Nettle-Eval，在1000个真实案例中达到98.5%的修复率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线编程平台上的用户面临TLE错误难以解决的挑战，错误信息缺乏诊断价值，平台支持有限，现有调试工具帮助不大，导致许多用户在多次TLE失败后放弃提交。

Method: 手动分析1000个Codeforces的TLE提交，分类根本原因；开发Nettle工具，将LLM与编译器生成的针对性自动反馈和测试用例相结合；创建Nettle-Eval评估框架。

Result: TLE错误不仅源于低效算法，还包括无限循环、数据结构使用不当和I/O低效；Nettle在1000个真实案例中达到98.5%的修复率，远超最强LLM基线，所有修复都通过了Nettle-Eval和平台官方检查器。

Conclusion: TLE错误的原因比传统认知更为复杂，Nettle工具能有效自动修复TLE错误，其评估框架可靠，为在线编程平台提供了实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Online programming platforms such as Codeforces and LeetCode attract millions
of users seeking to learn to program or refine their skills for industry
interviews. A major challenge for these users is the Time Limit Exceeded (TLE)
error, triggered when a program exceeds the execution time bound. Although
designed as a performance safeguard, TLE errors are difficult to resolve: error
messages provide no diagnostic insight, platform support is minimal, and
existing debugging tools offer little help. As a result, many users abandon
their submissions after repeated TLE failures.
  This paper presents the first large-scale empirical study of TLE errors in
online programming. We manually analyzed 1000 Codeforces submissions with TLE
errors, classified their root causes, and traced how users attempted to fix
them. Our analysis shows that TLE errors often arise not only from inefficient
algorithms but also from infinite loops, improper data structure use, and
inefficient I/O, challenging the conventional view that TLEs are purely
performance issues.
  Guided by these findings, we introduce Nettle, the first automated repair
tool specifically designed for TLE errors, and Nettle-Eval, the first framework
for evaluating TLE repairs. Integrating LLMs with targeted automated feedback
generated by the compiler and test cases, Nettle produces small, correct code
edits that eliminate TLEs while preserving functionality. Evaluated on the same
1000 real-world cases, Nettle achieves a 98.5% fix rate, far exceeding the
strongest LLM baseline, and all of its repairs pass both Nettle-Eval and the
platform's official checker, confirming the reliability of our framework.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有APR方法因难以生成精确规范而面临两个主要挑战：生成过多看似合理的补丁候选和过拟合到部分测试用例。

Method: PathFix通过四个步骤工作：追踪错误路径、推导期望路径、生成和评估补丁、验证补丁正确性。集成LLM以增强修复性能和缓解可扩展性问题。

Result: 实验结果表明PathFix优于现有解决方案，特别是在处理复杂程序结构（如循环和递归）方面表现突出。

Conclusion: PathFix通过路径敏感约束和LLM集成，有效解决了APR中的过拟合和可扩展性问题，提升了程序修复的准确性和效率。

Abstract: Automated program repair (APR) techniques are effective in fixing inevitable
defects in software, enhancing development efficiency and software robustness.
However, due to the difficulty of generating precise specifications, existing
APR methods face two main challenges: generating too many plausible patch
candidates and overfitting them to partial test cases. To tackle these
challenges, we introduce a new APR method named PathFix, which leverages
path-sensitive constraints extracted from correct execution paths to generate
patches for repairing buggy code. It is based on one observation: if a buggy
program is repairable, at least one expected path is supposed to replace the
fault path in the patched program. PathFix operates in four main steps. First,
it traces fault paths reaching the fault output in the buggy program. Second,
it derives expected paths by analyzing the desired correct output on the
control flow graph, where an expected path defines how a feasible patch leads
to the correct execution. Third, PathFix generates and evaluates patches by
solving state constraints along the expected path. Fourth, we validate the
correctness of the generated patch. To further enhance repair performance and
mitigate scalability issues introduced by path-sensitive analysis, we integrate
a large language model (LLM) into our framework. Experimental results show that
PathFix outperforms existing solutions, particularly in handling complex
program structures such as loops and recursion.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于静态数据集的测试生成方法存在"固定难度天花板"，无法发现超出训练范围的新颖或更复杂的bug，限制了LLM生成代码的可靠性提升。

Method: 采用对抗性强化学习框架，让测试生成器与对抗性代码生成器进行动态对抗，测试生成器通过RL优化同时最大化"输出准确性"和"攻击成功率"。

Result: 实验表明ATGen显著优于现有最先进方法，既可作为更有效的Best-of-N推理过滤器，也可作为训练代码生成模型的更高质量奖励源。

Conclusion: ATGen建立了一种新的动态范式，通过持续对抗训练打破固定难度限制，显著提升了LLM生成代码的可靠性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at code generation, yet their outputs
often contain subtle bugs, for which effective test cases are a critical
bottleneck. Existing test generation methods, whether based on prompting or
supervised fine-tuning, rely on static datasets. This imposes a
``fixed-difficulty ceiling'', fundamentally limiting their ability to uncover
novel or more complex bugs beyond their training scope. To overcome this, we
introduce ATGen, a framework that trains a test case generator via adversarial
reinforcement learning. ATGen pits a test generator against an adversarial code
generator that continuously crafts harder bugs to evade the current policy.
This dynamic loop creates a curriculum of increasing difficulty challenging
current policy. The test generator is optimized via Reinforcement Learning (RL)
to jointly maximize ``Output Accuracy'' and ``Attack Success'', enabling it to
learn a progressively stronger policy that breaks the fixed-difficulty ceiling
of static training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ATGen significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. We further validate its practical
utility, showing it serves as both a more effective filter for Best-of-N
inference and a higher-quality reward source for training code generation
models. Our work establishes a new, dynamic paradigm for improving the
reliability of LLM-generated code.

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of ensuring realistic traffic conditions
by proposing a methodology that systematically identifies traffic simulation
requirements. Using a structured approach based on sub-goals in each study
phase, specific technical needs are derived for microscopic levels, agent
models, and visual representation. The methodology aims to maintain a high
degree of fidelity, enhancing both the validity of experimental outcomes and
participant engagement. By providing a clear link between study objectives and

TL;DR: 本文对20个最先进的LLM代理在自动化Web漏洞复现方面进行了首次全面评估，发现虽然LLM代理在简单库漏洞上表现良好，但在需要多组件环境的复杂服务漏洞上持续失败。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM代理在软件工程和网络安全任务中表现出色，但自动化Web漏洞复现这一关键应用尚未充分探索。本文旨在系统评估LLM代理在真实Web漏洞复现场景中的能力。

Method: 系统评估20个来自软件工程、网络安全和通用领域的LLM代理，在16个维度上评估技术能力、环境适应性和用户体验因素。在3个代表性Web漏洞上测试后，选择3个表现最佳的代理在包含80个真实CVE的基准数据集上进行深入评估。

Result: LLM代理在简单库漏洞上取得合理成功，但在复杂服务漏洞上持续失败。复杂环境配置和认证障碍导致代理能执行漏洞利用代码但无法触发实际漏洞。对输入指导高度敏感，在不完整认证信息下性能下降超过33%。

Conclusion: 当前LLM代理能力与可靠自动化漏洞复现需求之间存在显著差距，需要在环境适应和自主问题解决能力方面取得进展。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents have demonstrated remarkable capabilities
in software engineering and cybersecurity tasks, including code generation,
vulnerability discovery, and automated testing. One critical but underexplored
application is automated web vulnerability reproduction, which transforms
vulnerability reports into working exploits. Although recent advances suggest
promising potential, challenges remain in applying LLM agents to real-world web
vulnerability reproduction scenarios. In this paper, we present the first
comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art LLM agents for automated web
vulnerability reproduction. We systematically assess 20 agents from software
engineering, cybersecurity, and general domains across 16 dimensions, including
technical capabilities, environment adaptability, and user experience factors,
on 3 representative web vulnerabilities. Based on the results, we select three
top-performing agents (OpenHands, SWE-agent, and CAI) for in-depth evaluation
on our benchmark dataset of 80 real-world CVEs spanning 7 vulnerability types
and 6 web technologies. Our results reveal that while LLM agents achieve
reasonable success on simple library-based vulnerabilities, they consistently
fail on complex service-based vulnerabilities requiring multi-component
environments. Complex environment configurations and authentication barriers
create a gap where agents can execute exploit code but fail to trigger actual
vulnerabilities. We observe high sensitivity to input guidance, with
performance degrading by over 33% under incomplete authentication information.
Our findings highlight the significant gap between current LLM agent
capabilities and the demands of reliable automated vulnerability reproduction,
emphasizing the need for advances in environmental adaptation and autonomous
problem-solving capabilities.

TL;DR: 提出一种基于名称预测内聚度(NPC)的无监督方法，通过量化源代码中的内聚度破坏来检测恶意代码注入，在极端不平衡测试集上表现出良好的检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 供应链攻击通过合法项目中注入恶意代码严重威胁软件安全，这类攻击虽然罕见但破坏性极大。现有自动化工具检测困难，因为需要理解插入代码及其上下文的意图。

Method: 使用基于名称预测的内聚度(NPC)度量，分析恶意代码引入时函数内聚度的变化，并与自然内聚度波动进行比较。在54,707个函数和369个开源C++仓库上进行实验。

Result: 代码注入会降低内聚度，并使命名模式转向更短、描述性更差的名称。在1:1,000的不平衡比例下达到36.41%的Precision@100，在1:10,000比例下达到12.47%。

Conclusion: 自动化的内聚度测量，特别是基于名称预测的内聚度方法，有助于识别供应链攻击，提高源代码完整性。

Abstract: Supply chain attacks significantly threaten software security with malicious
code injections within legitimate projects. Such attacks are very rare but may
have a devastating impact. Detecting spurious code injections using automated
tools is further complicated as it often requires deciphering the intention of
both the inserted code and its context. In this study, we propose an
unsupervised approach for highlighting spurious code injections by quantifying
cohesion disruptions in the source code. Using a name-prediction-based cohesion
(NPC) metric, we analyze how function cohesion changes when malicious code is
introduced compared to natural cohesion fluctuations. An analysis of 54,707
functions over 369 open-source C++ repositories reveals that code injection
reduces cohesion and shifts naming patterns toward shorter, less descriptive
names compared to genuine function updates. Considering the sporadic nature of
real supply-chain attacks, we evaluate the proposed method with extreme
test-set imbalance and show that monitoring high-cohesion functions with NPC
can effectively detect functions with injected code, achieving a Precision@100
of 36.41% at a 1:1,000 ratio and 12.47% at 1:10,000. These results suggest that
automated cohesion measurements, in general, and name-prediction-based
cohesion, in particular, may help identify supply chain attacks, improving
source code integrity.

Conclusion: 现代ISA迁移面临与二进制翻译不同的新挑战，AI可以发挥重要作用，但仍有一些挑战性任务需要进一步研究。

Abstract: Migrating codebases from one instruction set architecture (ISA) to another is
a major engineering challenge. A recent example is the adoption of Arm (in
addition to x86) across the major Cloud hyperscalers. Yet, this problem has
seen limited attention by the academic community. Most work has focused on
static and dynamic binary translation, and the traditional conventional wisdom
has been that this is the primary challenge.
  In this paper, we show that this is no longer the case. Modern ISA migrations
can often build on a robust open-source ecosystem, making it possible to
recompile all relevant software from scratch. This introduces a new and
multifaceted set of challenges, which are different from binary translation.
  By analyzing a large-scale migration from x86 to Arm at Google, spanning
almost 40,000 code commits, we derive a taxonomy of tasks involved in ISA
migration. We show how Google automated many of the steps involved, and
demonstrate how AI can play a major role in automatically addressing these
tasks. We identify tasks that remain challenging and highlight research
challenges that warrant further attention.
