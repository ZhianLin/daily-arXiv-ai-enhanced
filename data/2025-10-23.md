Abstract: Earth observation involves collecting, analyzing, and processing an
ever-growing mass of data. Automatically harvesting information is crucial for
addressing significant societal, economic, and environmental challenges,
ranging from environmental monitoring to urban planning and disaster
management. However, the high dimensionality of these data poses challenges in
terms of sparsity, inefficiency, and the curse of dimensionality, which limits
the effectiveness of machine learning models. Dimensionality reduction (DR)
techniques, specifically feature extraction, address these challenges by
preserving essential data properties while reducing complexity and enhancing
tasks such as data compression, cleaning, fusion, visualization, anomaly
detection, and prediction. This review provides a handbook for leveraging DR
across the RS data value chain and identifies opportunities for under-explored
DR algorithms and their application in future research.

### [2] [Ninja Codes: Neurally Generated Fiducial Markers for Stealthy 6-DoF Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18976)
*Yuichiro Takeuchi,Yusuke Imoto,Shunya Kato*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Ninja Codes是一种神经生成的基准标记，能够自然地融入真实环境，通过视觉上微小的修改将任意图像转换为隐蔽的6自由度位置跟踪标记。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基准标记在美学和其他原因下显得突兀，需要一种能够隐蔽融入环境的跟踪解决方案。

Method: 使用端到端深度学习流程，包括编码器网络将图像转换为Ninja Codes，以及联合训练的网络模块进行创建和检测。

Result: 实验证明Ninja Codes在常见室内光照条件下能够提供可靠的位置跟踪，同时成功隐藏在多样环境纹理中。

Conclusion: Ninja Codes在传统基准标记因外观显眼而不适用的场景中具有特殊价值，可用于增强现实、机器人技术等应用。

Abstract: In this paper we describe Ninja Codes, neurally-generated fiducial markers
that can be made to naturally blend into various real-world environments. An
encoder network converts arbitrary images into Ninja Codes by applying visually
modest alterations; the resulting codes, printed and pasted onto surfaces, can
provide stealthy 6-DoF location tracking for a wide range of applications
including augmented reality, robotics, motion-based user interfaces, etc. Ninja
Codes can be printed using off-the-shelf color printers on regular printing
paper, and can be detected using any device equipped with a modern RGB camera
and capable of running inference. Using an end-to-end process inspired by prior
work on deep steganography, we jointly train a series of network modules that
perform the creation and detection of Ninja Codes. Through experiments, we
demonstrate Ninja Codes' ability to provide reliable location tracking under
common indoor lighting conditions, while successfully concealing themselves
within diverse environmental textures. We expect Ninja Codes to offer
particular value in scenarios where the conspicuous appearances of conventional
fiducial markers make them undesirable for aesthetic and other reasons.

### [3] [Robust Driving QA through Metadata-Grounded Context and Task-Specific Prompts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19001)
*Seungjun Yu,Junsung Park,Youngsun Lim,Hyunjung Shim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一个两阶段的自动驾驶视觉语言问答系统，通过精心设计的提示和上下文增强，显著提升高级感知、预测和规划问题的回答准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决自动驾驶中高级感知、预测和规划问题的视觉语言问答挑战，利用预训练视觉语言模型但需要更好的上下文理解和提示工程。

Method: 两阶段方法：第一阶段使用大型多模态LLM（Qwen2.5-VL-32B）处理六摄像头输入、历史时序窗口和思维链提示；第二阶段增强场景元数据和任务特定指令。采用自一致性集成提高可靠性。

Result: 在驾驶QA基准测试中显著超越基线模型：第一阶段使用5历史帧和10-shot提示达到65.1%准确率（零-shot为62.61%），自一致性提升至66.85%，第二阶段达到67.37%。在严重视觉损坏下仍保持96%准确率。

Conclusion: 精心设计的提示工程和上下文基础可以大幅增强预训练视觉语言模型在高级驾驶问答任务中的表现。

Abstract: We present a two-phase vision-language QA system for autonomous driving that
answers high-level perception, prediction, and planning questions. In Phase-1,
a large multimodal LLM (Qwen2.5-VL-32B) is conditioned on six-camera inputs, a
short temporal window of history, and a chain-of-thought prompt with few-shot
exemplars. A self-consistency ensemble (multiple sampled reasoning chains)
further improves answer reliability. In Phase-2, we augment the prompt with
nuScenes scene metadata (object annotations, ego-vehicle state, etc.) and
category-specific question instructions (separate prompts for perception,
prediction, planning tasks). In experiments on a driving QA benchmark, our
approach significantly outperforms the baseline Qwen2.5 models. For example,
using 5 history frames and 10-shot prompting in Phase-1 yields 65.1% overall
accuracy (vs.62.61% with zero-shot); applying self-consistency raises this to
66.85%. Phase-2 achieves 67.37% overall. Notably, the system maintains 96%
accuracy under severe visual corruption. These results demonstrate that
carefully engineered prompts and contextual grounding can greatly enhance
high-level driving QA with pretrained vision-language models.

*Xueqi Ma,Yanbei Jiang,Sarah Erfani,James Bailey,Weifeng Liu,Krista A. Ehinger,Jey Han Lau*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PICK是一个用于心理图像分析的多步骤框架，通过层次化分析和知识注入，使多模态大语言模型能够处理主观情感任务如房树人测试。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在客观感知任务中表现出色，但在主观情感领域如心理分析中的应用仍未被充分探索。

Method: 将包含多个实例的绘画分解为语义子图，构建层次表示；分析各层次子图提取心理洞察；引入HTP知识库和特征提取模块生成心理档案；整合多方面信息生成评估。

Result: 实验结果表明PICK显著提升了多模态大语言模型在心理分析中的能力，并验证了其作为通用框架在情感理解任务中的扩展性。

Conclusion: PICK弥合了多模态大语言模型与专业领域之间的差距，为通过视觉表达理解人类心理状态提供了结构化且可解释的框架。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated exceptional
performance across various objective multimodal perception tasks, yet their
application to subjective, emotionally nuanced domains, such as psychological
analysis, remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we introduce PICK, a
multi-step framework designed for Psychoanalytical Image Comprehension through
hierarchical analysis and Knowledge injection with MLLMs, specifically focusing
on the House-Tree-Person (HTP) Test, a widely used psychological assessment in
clinical practice. First, we decompose drawings containing multiple instances
into semantically meaningful sub-drawings, constructing a hierarchical
representation that captures spatial structure and content across three levels:
single-object level, multi-object level, and whole level. Next, we analyze
these sub-drawings at each level with a targeted focus, extracting
psychological or emotional insights from their visual cues. We also introduce
an HTP knowledge base and design a feature extraction module, trained with
reinforcement learning, to generate a psychological profile for single-object
level analysis. This profile captures both holistic stylistic features and
dynamic object-specific features (such as those of the house, tree, or person),
correlating them with psychological states. Finally, we integrate these
multi-faceted information to produce a well-informed assessment that aligns
with expert-level reasoning. Our approach bridges the gap between MLLMs and
specialized expert domains, offering a structured and interpretable framework
for understanding human mental states through visual expression. Experimental
results demonstrate that the proposed PICK significantly enhances the
capability of MLLMs in psychological analysis. It is further validated as a
general framework through extensions to emotion understanding tasks.

### [5] [$Δ$t-Mamba3D: A Time-Aware Spatio-Temporal State-Space Model for Breast Cancer Risk Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19003)
*Zhengbo Zhou,Dooman Arefan,Margarita Zuley,Shandong Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Time-Aware Δt-Mamba3D模型，一种用于纵向医学图像分析的新型状态空间架构，能够有效处理不规则时间间隔的高分辨率图像序列，在乳腺癌风险预测任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决纵向放射图像分析中的基本数据挑战：如何有效建模在不规则时间间隔捕获的高分辨率图像序列，充分利用其中的空间和时间线索。

Method: 采用连续时间选择性扫描机制，将真实检查时间差明确集成到状态转换中，并辅以多尺度3D邻域融合模块来稳健捕获时空关系。

Result: 在乳腺癌风险预测基准测试中，验证c-index提高了2-5个百分点，1-5年AUC得分高于现有的循环、transformer和状态空间模型变体。

Conclusion: 该模型能够高效处理长而复杂的患者筛查历史，为纵向图像分析提供了新的框架，得益于其线性复杂度。

Abstract: Longitudinal analysis of sequential radiological images is hampered by a
fundamental data challenge: how to effectively model a sequence of
high-resolution images captured at irregular time intervals. This data
structure contains indispensable spatial and temporal cues that current methods
fail to fully exploit. Models often compromise by either collapsing spatial
information into vectors or applying spatio-temporal models that are
computationally inefficient and incompatible with non-uniform time steps. We
address this challenge with Time-Aware $\Delta$t-Mamba3D, a novel state-space
architecture adapted for longitudinal medical imaging. Our model simultaneously
encodes irregular inter-visit intervals and rich spatio-temporal context while
remaining computationally efficient. Its core innovation is a continuous-time
selective scanning mechanism that explicitly integrates the true time
difference between exams into its state transitions. This is complemented by a
multi-scale 3D neighborhood fusion module that robustly captures
spatio-temporal relationships. In a comprehensive breast cancer risk prediction
benchmark using sequential screening mammogram exams, our model shows superior
performance, improving the validation c-index by 2-5 percentage points and
achieving higher 1-5 year AUC scores compared to established variants of
recurrent, transformer, and state-space models. Thanks to its linear
complexity, the model can efficiently process long and complex patient
screening histories of mammograms, forming a new framework for longitudinal
image analysis.

### [6] [A Matter of Time: Revealing the Structure of Time in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19559)
*Nidham Tekaya,Manuela Waldner,Matthias Zeppelzauer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文研究了大规模视觉语言模型的时间感知能力，提出了TIME10k基准数据集，发现时间信息在VLM嵌入空间中沿低维非线性流形分布，并提出了从嵌入空间提取显式时间线表示的方法。


<details>

Motivation: 评估视觉语言模型对视觉内容的时间定位能力，探索模型是否能够理解图像的时间背景信息。

Method: 引入TIME10k数据集，评估37个VLM的时间感知能力，发现时间信息在嵌入空间中的低维流形结构，并提出从嵌入空间提取时间线表示的方法。

Result: 时间信息在VLM嵌入空间中沿低维非线性流形分布，提出的时间线方法在时间推理任务中达到竞争性甚至更优的准确率，且计算效率高。

Conclusion: 视觉语言模型具有内在的时间感知能力，时间信息在嵌入空间中具有可提取的结构化表示，这为时间推理任务提供了新的可能性。

Abstract: Large-scale vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP have gained popularity
for their generalizable and expressive multimodal representations. By
leveraging large-scale training data with diverse textual metadata, VLMs
acquire open-vocabulary capabilities, solving tasks beyond their training
scope. This paper investigates the temporal awareness of VLMs, assessing their
ability to position visual content in time. We introduce TIME10k, a benchmark
dataset of over 10,000 images with temporal ground truth, and evaluate the
time-awareness of 37 VLMs by a novel methodology. Our investigation reveals
that temporal information is structured along a low-dimensional, non-linear
manifold in the VLM embedding space. Based on this insight, we propose methods
to derive an explicit ``timeline'' representation from the embedding space.
These representations model time and its chronological progression and thereby
facilitate temporal reasoning tasks. Our timeline approaches achieve
competitive to superior accuracy compared to a prompt-based baseline while
being computationally efficient. All code and data are available at
https://tekayanidham.github.io/timeline-page/.

### [7] [MoAlign: Motion-Centric Representation Alignment for Video Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19022)
*Aritra Bhowmik,Denis Korzhenkov,Cees G. M. Snoek,Amirhossein Habibian,Mohsen Ghafoorian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种运动中心对齐框架，通过从预训练视频编码器中学习解耦的运动子空间来改进文本到视频扩散模型，使其生成更符合物理常识的视频。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本到视频扩散模型在生成时间连贯和物理合理的运动方面存在不足，主要原因是模型对复杂运动的理解不够充分。现有方法通过对齐扩散模型与预训练视频编码器的特征，但这些编码器的特征混合了视频外观和动态信息，限制了对齐效果。

Method: 提出运动中心对齐框架：1）从预训练视频编码器中学习解耦的运动子空间；2）优化该子空间以预测真实光流，确保捕获真实的运动动态；3）将文本到视频扩散模型的潜在特征对齐到这个新子空间。

Result: 该方法在VideoPhy、VideoPhy2、VBench和VBench-2.0等基准测试上进行了实证评估，并通过用户研究验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法能够改进最先进的视频扩散模型的物理常识，同时保持对文本提示的遵循，生成更合理的视频。

Abstract: Text-to-video diffusion models have enabled high-quality video synthesis, yet
often fail to generate temporally coherent and physically plausible motion. A
key reason is the models' insufficient understanding of complex motions that
natural videos often entail. Recent works tackle this problem by aligning
diffusion model features with those from pretrained video encoders. However,
these encoders mix video appearance and dynamics into entangled features,
limiting the benefit of such alignment. In this paper, we propose a
motion-centric alignment framework that learns a disentangled motion subspace
from a pretrained video encoder. This subspace is optimized to predict
ground-truth optical flow, ensuring it captures true motion dynamics. We then
align the latent features of a text-to-video diffusion model to this new
subspace, enabling the generative model to internalize motion knowledge and
generate more plausible videos. Our method improves the physical commonsense in
a state-of-the-art video diffusion model, while preserving adherence to textual
prompts, as evidenced by empirical evaluations on VideoPhy, VideoPhy2, VBench,
and VBench-2.0, along with a user study.

### [8] [PoSh: Using Scene Graphs To Guide LLMs-as-a-Judge For Detailed Image Descriptions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19060)
*Amith Ananthram,Elias Stengel-Eskin,Lorena A. Bradford,Julia Demarest,Adam Purvis,Keith Krut,Robert Stein,Rina Elster Pantalony,Mohit Bansal,Kathleen McKeown*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PoSh是一个用于详细图像描述评估的新指标，使用场景图作为结构化评分标准来指导LLM作为评判者，在细粒度错误识别方面优于现有指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估指标是为短文本设计的，无法有效评估长文本的详细图像描述，特别是对属性和关系附着的敏感性不足。

Method: 使用场景图作为结构化评分标准，结合LLM作为评判者，生成基于细粒度错误的聚合分数。

Result: PoSh在DOCENT数据集上与人类评分相关性更强（Spearman ρ +0.05），对图像类型具有鲁棒性，并能作为有效的奖励函数。

Conclusion: PoSh和DOCENT基准为详细图像描述评估提供了更好的工具，揭示了基础模型在描述复杂场景动态图像时的局限性。

Abstract: While vision-language models (VLMs) have advanced into detailed image
description, evaluation remains a challenge. Standard metrics (e.g. CIDEr,
SPICE) were designed for short texts and tuned to recognize errors that are now
uncommon, such as object misidentification. In contrast, long texts require
sensitivity to attribute and relation attachments and scores that localize
errors to particular text spans. In this work, we introduce PoSh, a metric for
detailed image description that uses scene graphs as structured rubrics to
guide LLMs-as-a-Judge, producing aggregate scores grounded in fine-grained
errors (e.g. mistakes in compositional understanding). PoSh is replicable,
interpretable and a better proxy for human raters than existing metrics
(including GPT4o-as-a-Judge). To validate PoSh, we introduce a challenging new
dataset, DOCENT. This novel benchmark contains artwork, paired with
expert-written references, and model-generated descriptions, augmented with
granular and coarse judgments of their quality from art history students. Thus,
DOCENT enables evaluating both detailed image description metrics and detailed
image description itself in a challenging new domain. We show that PoSh
achieves stronger correlations (+0.05 Spearman $\rho$) with the human judgments
in DOCENT than the best open-weight alternatives, is robust to image type
(using CapArena, an existing dataset of web imagery) and is a capable reward
function, outperforming standard supervised fine-tuning. Then, using PoSh, we
characterize the performance of open and closed models in describing the
paintings, sketches and statues in DOCENT and find that foundation models
struggle to achieve full, error-free coverage of images with rich scene
dynamics, establishing a demanding new task to gauge VLM progress. Through both
PoSh and DOCENT, we hope to enable advances in important areas such as
assistive text generation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出UniHPR统一人体姿态表示学习管道，通过基于奇异值的对比学习损失对齐图像、2D和3D人体姿态嵌入，在Human3.6M和3DPW数据集上取得优异性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态人体姿态表示在人体中心应用中至关重要，但现有研究缺乏对不同表示之间相关性的系统研究，特别是在对比学习范式下。

Method: 提出UniHPR统一人体姿态表示学习管道，使用基于奇异值的对比学习损失同时对齐图像、2D和3D人体姿态嵌入。

Result: 在Human3.6M数据集上MPJPE达到49.9mm，在3DPW数据集上PA-MPJPE达到51.6mm，并在Human3.6M数据集上实现2D和3D姿态检索，检索误差为9.24mm MPJPE。

Conclusion: UniHPR通过统一的多模态对齐方法有效提升了人体姿态表示的性能，为下游任务提供了强大的基础表示。

Abstract: In recent years, there has been a growing interest in developing effective
alignment pipelines to generate unified representations from different
modalities for multi-modal fusion and generation. As an important component of
Human-Centric applications, Human Pose representations are critical in many
downstream tasks, such as Human Pose Estimation, Action Recognition,
Human-Computer Interaction, Object tracking, etc. Human Pose representations or
embeddings can be extracted from images, 2D keypoints, 3D skeletons, mesh
models, and lots of other modalities. Yet, there are limited instances where
the correlation among all of those representations has been clearly researched
using a contrastive paradigm. In this paper, we propose UniHPR, a unified Human
Pose Representation learning pipeline, which aligns Human Pose embeddings from
images, 2D and 3D human poses. To align more than two data representations at
the same time, we propose a novel singular value-based contrastive learning
loss, which better aligns different modalities and further boosts performance.
To evaluate the effectiveness of the aligned representation, we choose 2D and
3D Human Pose Estimation (HPE) as our evaluation tasks. In our evaluation, with
a simple 3D human pose decoder, UniHPR achieves remarkable performance metrics:
MPJPE 49.9mm on the Human3.6M dataset and PA-MPJPE 51.6mm on the 3DPW dataset
with cross-domain evaluation. Meanwhile, we are able to achieve 2D and 3D pose
retrieval with our unified human pose representations in Human3.6M dataset,
where the retrieval error is 9.24mm in MPJPE.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准U-Net模型在脑肿瘤分割中面临挑战，特别是在处理不规则形状和模糊边界时准确性不足，同时高分辨率MRI数据训练需要大量计算资源且存在类别不平衡问题。

Method: 将注意力机制集成到3D U-Net模型中，使模型能够捕捉复杂细节并优先处理信息丰富的区域；同时使用基于数字图像处理的肿瘤检测算法来解决训练数据不平衡问题。

Conclusion: 提出的模型有效提高了脑肿瘤分割性能，为临床环境中的可靠诊断提供了有价值的见解。

Abstract: In the realm of medical diagnostics, rapid advancements in Artificial
Intelligence (AI) have significantly yielded remarkable improvements in brain
tumor segmentation. Encoder-Decoder architectures, such as U-Net, have played a
transformative role by effectively extracting meaningful representations in 3D
brain tumor segmentation from Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. However,
standard U-Net models encounter challenges in accurately delineating tumor
regions, especially when dealing with irregular shapes and ambiguous
boundaries. Additionally, training robust segmentation models on
high-resolution MRI data, such as the BraTS datasets, necessitates high
computational resources and often faces challenges associated with class
imbalance. This study proposes the integration of the attention mechanism into
the 3D U-Net model, enabling the model to capture intricate details and
prioritize informative regions during the segmentation process. Additionally, a
tumor detection algorithm based on digital image processing techniques is
utilized to address the issue of imbalanced training data and mitigate bias.
This study aims to enhance the performance of brain tumor segmentation,
ultimately improving the reliability of diagnosis. The proposed model is
thoroughly evaluated and assessed on the BraTS 2020 dataset using various
performance metrics to accomplish this goal. The obtained results indicate that
the model outperformed related studies, exhibiting dice of 0.975, specificity
of 0.988, and sensitivity of 0.995, indicating the efficacy of the proposed
model in improving brain tumor segmentation, offering valuable insights for
reliable diagnosis in clinical settings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究应用联邦近端算法(FedProx)处理非独立同分布的超声乳腺癌图像数据集，结合改进的U-Net模型和注意力机制，在保护患者隐私的同时实现了96%的肿瘤分割准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 乳腺癌是全球女性死亡的主要原因，早期检测和准确诊断至关重要。但医疗数据的敏感性使得开发准确且保护隐私的AI模型具有挑战性。联邦学习虽然能保护隐私，但在非独立同分布数据集上训练会影响模型准确性和泛化能力。

Method: 应用联邦近端方法(FedProx)处理非独立同分布的超声乳腺癌图像数据集，并采用改进的U-Net模型结合注意力机制来增强肿瘤分割精度。

Result: 该方法实现了96%的全局模型准确率，在保护患者隐私的同时显著提高了肿瘤分割的准确性。

Conclusion: FedProx方法在非独立同分布的本地医疗数据集上训练精确机器学习模型具有巨大潜力，能够有效平衡隐私保护和模型性能。

Abstract: Breast cancer is a leading cause of death among women worldwide, emphasizing
the need for early detection and accurate diagnosis. As such Ultrasound
Imaging, a reliable and cost-effective tool, is used for this purpose, however
the sensitive nature of medical data makes it challenging to develop accurate
and private artificial intelligence models. A solution is Federated Learning as
it is a promising technique for distributed machine learning on sensitive
medical data while preserving patient privacy. However, training on
non-Independent and non-Identically Distributed (non-IID) local datasets can
impact the accuracy and generalization of the trained model, which is crucial
for accurate tumour boundary delineation in BC segmentation. This study aims to
tackle this challenge by applying the Federated Proximal (FedProx) method to
non-IID Ultrasonic Breast Cancer Imaging datasets. Moreover, we focus on
enhancing tumour segmentation accuracy by incorporating a modified U-Net model
with attention mechanisms. Our approach resulted in a global model with 96%
accuracy, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method in enhancing tumour
segmentation accuracy while preserving patient privacy. Our findings suggest
that FedProx has the potential to be a promising approach for training precise
machine learning models on non-IID local medical datasets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了X-Ego-CS数据集和跨自我对比学习(CECL)方法，用于研究复杂3D环境中的多智能体决策，通过同步的第一人称视角视频流促进团队战术意识。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要依赖第三人称视角，忽视了多智能体学习的同步自我中心特性，需要从个体视角理解团队战术的涌现。

Method: 构建X-Ego-CS数据集，包含124小时专业级Counter-Strike 2游戏录像，提供同步的第一人称视角视频流和状态-动作轨迹；提出CECL方法，通过对齐队友的自我中心视觉流来培养团队战术意识。

Result: 在队友-对手位置预测任务中验证了CECL的有效性，证明其能够增强智能体从单一第一人称视角推断队友和对手位置的能力。

Conclusion: X-Ego-CS和CECL为电子竞技中的跨自我中心多智能体基准测试奠定了基础，将游戏理解定位为多智能体建模和战术学习的测试平台。

Abstract: Human team tactics emerge from each player's individual perspective and their
ability to anticipate, interpret, and adapt to teammates' intentions. While
advances in video understanding have improved the modeling of team interactions
in sports, most existing work relies on third-person broadcast views and
overlooks the synchronous, egocentric nature of multi-agent learning. We
introduce X-Ego-CS, a benchmark dataset consisting of 124 hours of gameplay
footage from 45 professional-level matches of the popular e-sports game
Counter-Strike 2, designed to facilitate research on multi-agent
decision-making in complex 3D environments. X-Ego-CS provides cross-egocentric
video streams that synchronously capture all players' first-person perspectives
along with state-action trajectories. Building on this resource, we propose
Cross-Ego Contrastive Learning (CECL), which aligns teammates' egocentric
visual streams to foster team-level tactical situational awareness from an
individual's perspective. We evaluate CECL on a teammate-opponent location
prediction task, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing an agent's
ability to infer both teammate and opponent positions from a single
first-person view using state-of-the-art video encoders. Together, X-Ego-CS and
CECL establish a foundation for cross-egocentric multi-agent benchmarking in
esports. More broadly, our work positions gameplay understanding as a testbed
for multi-agent modeling and tactical learning, with implications for
spatiotemporal reasoning and human-AI teaming in both virtual and real-world
domains. Code and dataset are available at https://github.com/HATS-ICT/x-ego.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 疟疾诊断依赖人工观察血涂片图像，缺乏专业知识和手动操作可能导致误诊，因此需要计算机辅助自动诊断系统。

Method: 应用六种深度卷积网络（AlexNet、XceptionNet、VGG-19、Residual Attention Network、DenseNet-121和Custom-CNN）从血细胞图像中提取深度特征并进行分类。

Result: Residual Attention Network和XceptionNet在公开疟疾细胞图像数据集上表现最好，准确率分别为97.28%和97.55%，优于其他相关方法。

Conclusion: 深度学习驱动的方法能够实现疟疾的自动可靠检测，同时最小化人工参与，具有实际应用前景。

Abstract: Malaria, which primarily spreads with the bite of female anopheles mosquitos,
often leads to death of people - specifically children in the age-group of 0-5
years. Clinical experts identify malaria by observing RBCs in blood smeared
images with a microscope. Lack of adequate professional knowledge and skills,
and most importantly manual involvement may cause incorrect diagnosis.
Therefore, computer aided automatic diagnosis stands as a preferred substitute.
In this paper, well-demonstrated deep networks have been applied to extract
deep intrinsic features from blood cell images and thereafter classify them as
malaria infected or healthy cells. Among the six deep convolutional networks
employed in this work viz. AlexNet, XceptionNet, VGG-19, Residual Attention
Network, DenseNet-121 and Custom-CNN. Residual Attention Network and
XceptionNet perform relatively better than the rest on a publicly available
malaria cell image dataset. They yield an average accuracy of 97.28% and 97.55%
respectively, that surpasses other related methods on the same dataset. These
findings highly encourage the reality of deep learning driven method for
automatic and reliable detection of malaria while minimizing direct manual
involvement.

TL;DR: PruneHal是一种无需训练的方法，通过自适应KV缓存修剪来增强MLLMs对关键视觉信息的关注，从而缓解幻觉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有解决方案要么引入额外数据进行训练，要么在推理时加入外部或内部信息，这些方法都会带来额外计算成本。研究发现MLLMs中的幻觉与对视觉令牌注意力不足密切相关。

Method: 提出PruneHal方法，利用自适应KV缓存修剪来增强模型对关键视觉信息的关注，无需额外训练且几乎不增加推理成本。

Result: 在多个主流MLLMs上使用广泛使用的幻觉评估基准进行评估，获得了稳健且出色的结果。

Conclusion: PruneHal是首个将令牌修剪应用于MLLMs幻觉缓解的方法，具有模型无关性，可与不同解码策略无缝集成。

Abstract: While multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have made significant
progress in recent years, the issue of hallucinations remains a major
challenge. To mitigate this phenomenon, existing solutions either introduce
additional data for further training or incorporate external or internal
information during inference. However, these approaches inevitably introduce
extra computational costs. In this paper, we observe that hallucinations in
MLLMs are strongly associated with insufficient attention allocated to visual
tokens. In particular, the presence of redundant visual tokens disperses the
model's attention, preventing it from focusing on the most informative ones. As
a result, critical visual cues are often under-attended, which in turn
exacerbates the occurrence of hallucinations. Building on this observation, we
propose \textbf{PruneHal}, a training-free, simple yet effective method that
leverages adaptive KV cache pruning to enhance the model's focus on critical
visual information, thereby mitigating hallucinations. To the best of our
knowledge, we are the first to apply token pruning for hallucination mitigation
in MLLMs. Notably, our method don't require additional training and incurs
nearly no extra inference cost. Moreover, PruneHal is model-agnostic and can be
seamlessly integrated with different decoding strategies, including those
specifically designed for hallucination mitigation. We evaluate PruneHal on
several widely used hallucination evaluation benchmarks using four mainstream
MLLMs, achieving robust and outstanding results that highlight the
effectiveness and superiority of our method. Our code will be publicly
available.

TL;DR: 提出Video Consistency Distance (VCD)指标，通过基于奖励的微调框架增强视频扩散模型的时序一致性，特别针对图像到视频生成任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的基于奖励的微调方法主要关注整个生成视频序列的质量（如美学吸引力和整体一致性），但在图像到视频生成任务中时序一致性往往受到影响。

Method: 在视频帧特征的频率空间中定义VCD指标，通过频域分析有效捕捉帧信息，并将其集成到基于奖励的微调框架中。

Result: 在多个I2V数据集上的实验结果表明，使用VCD微调视频生成模型能显著提升时序一致性，且不会降低其他性能。

Conclusion: VCD是一种有效的时序一致性增强指标，能够在不牺牲其他性能的情况下改善图像到视频生成任务的时序连贯性。

Abstract: Reward-based fine-tuning of video diffusion models is an effective approach
to improve the quality of generated videos, as it can fine-tune models without
requiring real-world video datasets. However, it can sometimes be limited to
specific performances because conventional reward functions are mainly aimed at
enhancing the quality across the whole generated video sequence, such as
aesthetic appeal and overall consistency. Notably, the temporal consistency of
the generated video often suffers when applying previous approaches to
image-to-video (I2V) generation tasks. To address this limitation, we propose
Video Consistency Distance (VCD), a novel metric designed to enhance temporal
consistency, and fine-tune a model with the reward-based fine-tuning framework.
To achieve coherent temporal consistency relative to a conditioning image, VCD
is defined in the frequency space of video frame features to capture frame
information effectively through frequency-domain analysis. Experimental results
across multiple I2V datasets demonstrate that fine-tuning a video generation
model with VCD significantly enhances temporal consistency without degrading
other performance compared to the previous method.

TL;DR: Dream4Drive是一个用于自动驾驶感知任务的合成数据生成框架，通过3D感知引导图分解和渲染技术生成多视角逼真视频，显著提升自动驾驶的异常情况感知能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有驾驶世界模型主要关注生成质量和可控性指标，但忽视了对于自动驾驶性能至关重要的下游感知任务评估。传统方法需要先在合成数据上预训练再在真实数据上微调，训练周期加倍，当基线方法也使用双倍周期时，合成数据的优势变得不明显。

Method: Dream4Drive首先将输入视频分解为多个3D感知引导图，然后将3D资源渲染到这些引导图上，最后微调驾驶世界模型生成编辑后的多视角逼真视频，用于训练下游感知模型。

Result: 该框架能够大规模生成多视角异常情况，显著提升自动驾驶中的异常情况感知能力。同时发布了DriveObj3D大规模3D资源数据集，覆盖典型驾驶场景类别。

Conclusion: 综合实验表明，Dream4Drive在各种训练周期下都能有效提升下游感知模型的性能，为自动驾驶感知任务提供了强大的合成数据生成解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advancements in driving world models enable controllable generation of
high-quality RGB videos or multimodal videos. Existing methods primarily focus
on metrics related to generation quality and controllability. However, they
often overlook the evaluation of downstream perception tasks, which are
$\mathbf{really\ crucial}$ for the performance of autonomous driving. Existing
methods usually leverage a training strategy that first pretrains on synthetic
data and finetunes on real data, resulting in twice the epochs compared to the
baseline (real data only). When we double the epochs in the baseline, the
benefit of synthetic data becomes negligible. To thoroughly demonstrate the
benefit of synthetic data, we introduce Dream4Drive, a novel synthetic data
generation framework designed for enhancing the downstream perception tasks.
Dream4Drive first decomposes the input video into several 3D-aware guidance
maps and subsequently renders the 3D assets onto these guidance maps. Finally,
the driving world model is fine-tuned to produce the edited, multi-view
photorealistic videos, which can be used to train the downstream perception
models. Dream4Drive enables unprecedented flexibility in generating multi-view
corner cases at scale, significantly boosting corner case perception in
autonomous driving. To facilitate future research, we also contribute a
large-scale 3D asset dataset named DriveObj3D, covering the typical categories
in driving scenarios and enabling diverse 3D-aware video editing. We conduct
comprehensive experiments to show that Dream4Drive can effectively boost the
performance of downstream perception models under various training epochs.

Motivation: 现有动态场景重建方法在不同场景下表现不一致，缺乏能有效处理所有动态挑战的统一方法。

Method: 使用混合专家框架，通过体积感知像素路由器将高斯级权重投影到像素空间，实现专家输出的自适应融合。

Result: 在N3V和Technicolor数据集上的实验表明，MoE-GS在保持效率的同时持续优于最先进方法。

Conclusion: MoE-GS是首个将混合专家技术引入动态高斯溅射的方法，提供了统一的动态场景重建解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in dynamic scene reconstruction have significantly benefited
from 3D Gaussian Splatting, yet existing methods show inconsistent performance
across diverse scenes, indicating no single approach effectively handles all
dynamic challenges. To overcome these limitations, we propose Mixture of
Experts for Dynamic Gaussian Splatting (MoE-GS), a unified framework
integrating multiple specialized experts via a novel Volume-aware Pixel Router.
Our router adaptively blends expert outputs by projecting volumetric
Gaussian-level weights into pixel space through differentiable weight
splatting, ensuring spatially and temporally coherent results. Although MoE-GS
improves rendering quality, the increased model capacity and reduced FPS are
inherent to the MoE architecture. To mitigate this, we explore two
complementary directions: (1) single-pass multi-expert rendering and gate-aware
Gaussian pruning, which improve efficiency within the MoE framework, and (2) a
distillation strategy that transfers MoE performance to individual experts,
enabling lightweight deployment without architectural changes. To the best of
our knowledge, MoE-GS is the first approach incorporating Mixture-of-Experts
techniques into dynamic Gaussian splatting. Extensive experiments on the N3V
and Technicolor datasets demonstrate that MoE-GS consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art methods with improved efficiency. Video demonstrations are

TL;DR: SFGFusion是一种基于表面拟合的相机-4D成像雷达检测网络，通过估计物体的二次表面参数来增强空间表示和跨模态交互，提高深度预测精度，解决雷达点云稀疏性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 4D成像雷达具有低成本、长距离检测和精确速度测量等优势，但其稀疏点云和低分辨率限制了物体几何表示和多模态融合效果。

Method: 通过图像和雷达数据估计物体二次表面参数，生成密集伪点云缓解雷达稀疏性；使用预测深度引导图像特征从透视视图转换到鸟瞰视图；采用基于柱体的方法处理点云分支，最终使用标准2D骨干网络和检测头进行目标检测。

Result: 在TJ4DRadSet和view-of-delft(VoD)目标检测基准测试中取得了优越性能，有效融合了相机和4D雷达特征。

Conclusion: SFGFusion通过表面拟合指导的多模态融合方法，成功解决了4D成像雷达稀疏性问题，实现了高性能的3D目标检测。

Abstract: 3D object detection is essential for autonomous driving. As an emerging
sensor, 4D imaging radar offers advantages as low cost, long-range detection,
and accurate velocity measurement, making it highly suitable for object
detection. However, its sparse point clouds and low resolution limit object
geometric representation and hinder multi-modal fusion. In this study, we
introduce SFGFusion, a novel camera-4D imaging radar detection network guided
by surface fitting. By estimating quadratic surface parameters of objects from
image and radar data, the explicit surface fitting model enhances spatial
representation and cross-modal interaction, enabling more reliable prediction
of fine-grained dense depth. The predicted depth serves two purposes: 1) in an
image branch to guide the transformation of image features from perspective
view (PV) to a unified bird's-eye view (BEV) for multi-modal fusion, improving
spatial mapping accuracy; and 2) in a surface pseudo-point branch to generate
dense pseudo-point cloud, mitigating the radar point sparsity. The original
radar point cloud is also encoded in a separate radar branch. These two point
cloud branches adopt a pillar-based method and subsequently transform the
features into the BEV space. Finally, a standard 2D backbone and detection head
are used to predict object labels and bounding boxes from BEV features.
Experimental results show that SFGFusion effectively fuses camera and 4D radar
features, achieving superior performance on the TJ4DRadSet and view-of-delft
(VoD) object detection benchmarks.

Conclusion: 该方法通过小波变换特征增强和多帧轨迹优化，有效解决了GEO空间目标的检测难题，在复杂背景下表现出良好的检测性能。

Abstract: Space objects in Geostationary Earth Orbit (GEO) present significant
detection challenges in optical imaging due to weak signals, complex stellar
backgrounds, and environmental interference. In this paper, we enhance
high-frequency features of GEO targets while suppressing background noise at
the single-frame level through wavelet transform. Building on this, we propose
a multi-frame temporal trajectory completion scheme centered on the Hungarian
algorithm for globally optimal cross-frame matching. To effectively mitigate
missing and false detections, a series of key steps including temporal matching
and interpolation completion, temporal-consistency-based noise filtering, and
progressive trajectory refinement are designed in the post-processing pipeline.
Experimental results on the public SpotGEO dataset demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed method, achieving an F_1 score of 90.14%.

TL;DR: FadeLead是一个前景感知的协作感知框架，通过课程学习策略将背景上下文信息封装到紧凑的前景特征中，在带宽受限的车联网中实现高效信息共享。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有协作感知方法只传输前景区域特征而丢弃背景，但背景包含重要的上下文信息。车联网带宽限制使得传输整个特征图不可行。

Method: 采用课程学习策略，早期利用背景线索但逐步剪除，迫使模型将上下文信息内化到前景表示中，而不传输背景本身。

Result: 在模拟和真实世界基准测试中，FadeLead在不同带宽设置下均优于先前方法。

Conclusion: 上下文丰富的前景共享是有效的协作感知解决方案，FadeLead成功克服了背景信息丢失的限制。

Abstract: Collaborative perception enhances the reliability and spatial coverage of
autonomous vehicles by sharing complementary information across vehicles,
offering a promising solution to long-tail scenarios that challenge
single-vehicle perception. However, the bandwidth constraints of vehicular
networks make transmitting the entire feature map impractical. Recent methods,
therefore, adopt a foreground-centric paradigm, transmitting only predicted
foreground-region features while discarding the background, which encodes
essential context. We propose FadeLead, a foreground-centric framework that
overcomes this limitation by learning to encapsulate background context into
compact foreground features during training. At the core of our design is a
curricular learning strategy that leverages background cues early on but
progressively prunes them away, forcing the model to internalize context into
foreground representations without transmitting background itself. Extensive
experiments on both simulated and real-world benchmarks show that FadeLead
outperforms prior methods under different bandwidth settings, underscoring the
effectiveness of context-enriched foreground sharing.

Abstract: We present a survey on 4D generation and reconstruction, a fast-evolving
subfield of computer graphics whose developments have been propelled by recent
advances in neural fields, geometric and motion deep learning, as well 3D
generative artificial intelligence (GenAI). While our survey is not the first
of its kind, we build our coverage of the domain from a unique and distinctive
perspective of 4D representations\/}, to model 3D geometry evolving over time
while exhibiting motion and interaction. Specifically, instead of offering an
exhaustive enumeration of many works, we take a more selective approach by
focusing on representative works to highlight both the desirable properties and
ensuing challenges of each representation under different computation,
application, and data scenarios. The main take-away message we aim to convey to
the readers is on how to select and then customize the appropriate 4D
representations for their tasks. Organizationally, we separate the 4D
representations based on three key pillars: geometry, motion, and interaction.
Our discourse will not only encompass the most popular representations of
today, such as neural radiance fields (NeRFs) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS),
but also bring attention to relatively under-explored representations in the 4D
context, such as structured models and long-range motions. Throughout our
survey, we will reprise the role of large language models (LLMs) and video
foundational models (VFMs) in a variety of 4D applications, while steering our
discussion towards their current limitations and how they can be addressed. We
also provide a dedicated coverage on what 4D datasets are currently available,
as well as what is lacking, in driving the subfield forward. Project

Abstract: Real-world image super-resolution (Real-ISR) must handle complex degradations
and inherent reconstruction ambiguities. While generative models have improved
perceptual quality, a key trade-off remains with computational cost. One-step
diffusion models offer speed but often produce structural inaccuracies due to
distillation artifacts. To address this, we propose a novel SR framework that
enhances a one-step diffusion model using a ControlNet mechanism for semantic
edge guidance. This integrates edge information to provide dynamic structural
control during single-pass inference. We also introduce a hybrid loss combining
L2, LPIPS, and an edge-aware AME loss to optimize for pixel accuracy,
perceptual quality, and geometric precision. Experiments show our method
effectively improves structural integrity and realism while maintaining the
efficiency of one-step generation, achieving a superior balance between output
quality and inference speed. The results of test datasets will be published at

Abstract: Accurate and efficient recognition of Micro Air Vehicle (MAV) motion is
essential for enabling real-time perception and coordination in autonomous
aerial swarm. However, most existing approaches rely on large, computationally
intensive models that are unsuitable for resource-limited MAV platforms, which
results in a trade-off between recognition accuracy and inference speed. To
address these challenges, this paper proposes a lightweight MAV action
recognition framework, MobiAct, designed to achieve high accuracy with low
computational cost. Specifically, MobiAct adopts MobileNetV4 as the backbone
network and introduces a Stage-wise Orthogonal Knowledge Distillation (SOKD)
strategy to effectively transfer MAV motion features from a teacher network
(ResNet18) to a student network, thereby enhancing knowledge transfer
efficiency. Furthermore, a parameter-free attention mechanism is integrated
into the architecture to improve recognition accuracy without increasing model
complexity. In addition, a hybrid loss training strategy is developed to
combine multiple loss objectives, which ensures stable and robust optimization
during training. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed MobiAct
achieves low-energy and low-computation MAV action recognition, while
maintaining the fastest action decoding speed among compared methods. Across
all three self-collected datasets, MobiAct achieves an average recognition
accuracy of 92.12%, while consuming only 136.16 pJ of energy and processing
recognition at a rate of 8.84 actions per second. Notably, MobiAct decodes
actions up to 2 times faster than the leading method, with highly comparable
recognition accuracy, highlighting its superior efficiency in MAV action
recognition.

Conclusion: D2D框架成功克服了检测器不可微的限制，有效提升了文本到图像生成模型的计数能力。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have achieved strong performance in
semantic alignment, yet they still struggle with generating the correct number
of objects specified in prompts. Existing approaches typically incorporate
auxiliary counting networks as external critics to enhance numeracy. However,
since these critics must provide gradient guidance during generation, they are
restricted to regression-based models that are inherently differentiable, thus
excluding detector-based models with superior counting ability, whose
count-via-enumeration nature is non-differentiable. To overcome this
limitation, we propose Detector-to-Differentiable (D2D), a novel framework that
transforms non-differentiable detection models into differentiable critics,
thereby leveraging their superior counting ability to guide numeracy
generation. Specifically, we design custom activation functions to convert
detector logits into soft binary indicators, which are then used to optimize
the noise prior at inference time with pre-trained T2I models. Our extensive
experiments on SDXL-Turbo, SD-Turbo, and Pixart-DMD across four benchmarks of
varying complexity (low-density, high-density, and multi-object scenarios)
demonstrate consistent and substantial improvements in object counting accuracy
(e.g., boosting up to 13.7% on D2D-Small, a 400-prompt, low-density benchmark),
with minimal degradation in overall image quality and computational overhead.

Abstract: Alzheimer disease is a severe brain disorder that causes harm in various
brain areas and leads to memory damage. The limited availability of labeled
medical data poses a significant challenge for accurate Alzheimer disease
detection. There is a critical need for effective methods to improve the
accuracy of Alzheimer disease detection, considering the scarcity of labeled
data, the complexity of the disease, and the constraints related to data
privacy. To address this challenge, our study leverages the power of big data
in the form of pre-trained Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) within the
framework of Few-Shot Learning (FSL) and ensemble learning. We propose an
ensemble approach based on a Prototypical Network (ProtoNet), a powerful method
in FSL, integrating various pre-trained CNNs as encoders. This integration
enhances the richness of features extracted from medical images. Our approach
also includes a combination of class-aware loss and entropy loss to ensure a
more precise classification of Alzheimer disease progression levels. The
effectiveness of our method was evaluated using two datasets, the Kaggle
Alzheimer dataset and the ADNI dataset, achieving an accuracy of 99.72% and
99.86%, respectively. The comparison of our results with relevant
state-of-the-art studies demonstrated that our approach achieved superior
accuracy and highlighted its validity and potential for real-world applications

Abstract: Mistake analysis in procedural activities is a critical area of research with
applications spanning industrial automation, physical rehabilitation, education
and human-robot collaboration. This paper reviews vision-based methods for
detecting and predicting mistakes in structured tasks, focusing on procedural
and executional errors. By leveraging advancements in computer vision,
including action recognition, anticipation and activity understanding,

modeling. This work aims to establish a unified perspective on vision-based
mistake analysis in procedural activities, highlighting its potential to
enhance safety, efficiency and task performance across diverse domains.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出统一强化与模仿学习(RIL)算法，通过结合强化学习和对抗模仿学习，使小型视觉语言模型既能模仿大型教师模型的文本生成，又能通过强化信号系统提升生成能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型(VLMs)虽然取得显著进展，但其大规模特性在资源受限环境中不实用，需要开发高效训练算法来创建轻量级但强大的VLMs。

Method: RIL算法结合强化学习和对抗模仿学习，使用基于LLM的判别器区分学生和教师输出，并利用多个大型教师VLM提供多样化指导。

Result: 在多样化视觉语言基准测试中，RIL显著缩小了与最先进开源和闭源VLMs的性能差距，并在多个实例中超越了它们。

Conclusion: RIL的统一学习策略使学生模型实现显著性能提升，使其能够与领先的闭源VLMs竞争，为资源受限环境提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable progress, yet their
large scale often renders them impractical for resource-constrained
environments. This paper introduces Unified Reinforcement and Imitation
Learning (RIL), a novel and efficient training algorithm designed to create
powerful, lightweight VLMs. RIL distinctively combines the strengths of
reinforcement learning with adversarial imitation learning. This enables
smaller student VLMs not only to mimic the sophisticated text generation of
large teacher models but also to systematically improve their generative
capabilities through reinforcement signals. Key to our imitation framework is
an LLM-based discriminator that adeptly distinguishes between student and
teacher outputs, complemented by guidance from multiple large teacher VLMs to
ensure diverse learning. This unified learning strategy, leveraging both
reinforcement and imitation, empowers student models to achieve significant
performance gains, making them competitive with leading closed-source VLMs.
Extensive experiments on diverse vision-language benchmarks demonstrate that
RIL significantly narrows the performance gap with state-of-the-art open- and
closed-source VLMs and, in several instances, surpasses them.

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于动态签名验证的新方法TS-GATR，结合图注意力网络和门控循环单元来建模签名数据的时空依赖关系，在多个基准数据集上超越了现有最优方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手写签名验证在身份认证中至关重要，但由于用户内部变异性和伪造风险，实现高精度验证仍然具有挑战性。

Method: TS-GATR将签名表示为图结构，使用双图注意力变换器模块分别建模局部和全局空间特征，并集成GRU来捕获长期时间依赖关系。

Conclusion: TS-GATR通过有效建模签名数据的时空依赖关系，显著提升了动态签名验证的性能。

Abstract: Handwritten signature verification is a crucial aspect of identity
authentication, with applications in various domains such as finance and
e-commerce. However, achieving high accuracy in signature verification remains
challenging due to intra-user variability and the risk of forgery. This paper
introduces a novel approach for dynamic signature verification: the
Temporal-Spatial Graph Attention Transformer (TS-GATR). TS-GATR combines the
Graph Attention Network (GAT) and the Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) to model both
spatial and temporal dependencies in signature data. TS-GATR enhances
verification performance by representing signatures as graphs, where each node
captures dynamic features (e.g. position, velocity, pressure), and by using
attention mechanisms to model their complex relationships. The proposed method
further employs a Dual-Graph Attention Transformer (DGATR) module, which
utilizes k-step and k-nearest neighbor adjacency graphs to model local and
global spatial features, respectively. To capture long-term temporal
dependencies, the model integrates GRU, thereby enhancing its ability to learn
dynamic features during signature verification. Comprehensive experiments
conducted on benchmark datasets such as MSDS and DeepSignDB show that TS-GATR
surpasses current state-of-the-art approaches, consistently achieving lower
Equal Error Rates (EER) across various scenarios.

*Panagiotis Agrafiotis,Begüm Demir*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Seabed-Net是一个统一的多任务框架，能够同时从不同分辨率的遥感图像中预测水深和基于像素的海底分类，通过跨任务特征融合和动态任务不确定性加权，在浅水环境测绘中显著优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的方法将水深估计和海底分类作为独立任务处理，忽略了它们之间的相互作用，限制了深度学习方法在浅水环境测绘中的广泛应用。

Method: 采用双分支编码器分别处理水深估计和海底分类，通过注意力特征融合模块和窗口化Swin-Transformer融合块整合跨任务特征，并使用动态任务不确定性加权来平衡不同目标。

Result: 在两个异质性海岸站点的广泛评估中，相比传统经验模型和机器学习回归方法，RMSE降低高达75%；与最先进的单任务和多任务基线相比，水深RMSE降低10-30%，海底分类精度提高达8%。

Conclusion: 联合建模水深与海底底质和栖息地能够产生协同增益，为集成浅水测绘提供了一个稳健的开放解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate, detailed, and regularly updated bathymetry, coupled with complex
semantic content, is essential for under-mapped shallow-water environments
facing increasing climatological and anthropogenic pressures. However, existing
approaches that derive either depth or seabed classes from remote sensing
imagery treat these tasks in isolation, forfeiting the mutual benefits of their
interaction and hindering the broader adoption of deep learning methods. To
address these limitations, we introduce Seabed-Net, a unified multi-task
framework that simultaneously predicts bathymetry and pixel-based seabed
classification from remote sensing imagery of various resolutions. Seabed-Net
employs dual-branch encoders for bathymetry estimation and pixel-based seabed
classification, integrates cross-task features via an Attention Feature Fusion
module and a windowed Swin-Transformer fusion block, and balances objectives
through dynamic task uncertainty weighting. In extensive evaluations at two
heterogeneous coastal sites, it consistently outperforms traditional empirical
models and traditional machine learning regression methods, achieving up to
75\% lower RMSE. It also reduces bathymetric RMSE by 10-30\% compared to
state-of-the-art single-task and multi-task baselines and improves seabed
classification accuracy up to 8\%. Qualitative analyses further demonstrate
enhanced spatial consistency, sharper habitat boundaries, and corrected depth
biases in low-contrast regions. These results confirm that jointly modeling
depth with both substrate and seabed habitats yields synergistic gains,
offering a robust, open solution for integrated shallow-water mapping. Code and
pretrained weights are available at https://github.com/pagraf/Seabed-Net.

Conclusion: 尺度偏移领域泛化是一个重要且可行的研究方向，需要进一步深入探索。

Abstract: Crowd localization plays a crucial role in visual scene understanding towards
predicting each pedestrian location in a crowd, thus being applicable to
various downstream tasks. However, existing approaches suffer from significant
performance degradation due to discrepancies in head scale distributions (scale
shift) between training and testing data, a challenge known as domain
generalization (DG). This paper aims to comprehend the nature of scale shift
within the context of domain generalization for crowd localization models. To
this end, we address four critical questions: (i) How does scale shift
influence crowd localization in a DG scenario? (ii) How can we quantify this
influence? (iii) What causes this influence? (iv) How to mitigate the
influence? Initially, we conduct a systematic examination of how crowd
localization performance varies with different levels of scale shift. Then, we
establish a benchmark, ScaleBench, and reproduce 20 advanced DG algorithms to
quantify the influence. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the
limitations of existing algorithms and underscore the importance and complexity
of scale shift, a topic that remains insufficiently explored. To deepen our
understanding, we provide a rigorous theoretical analysis on scale shift.
Building on these insights, we further propose an effective algorithm called
Causal Feature Decomposition and Anisotropic Processing (Catto) to mitigate the
influence of scale shift in DG settings. Later, we also provide extensive
analytical experiments, revealing four significant insights for future
research. Our results emphasize the importance of this novel and applicable
research direction, which we term Scale Shift Domain Generalization.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BrainMCLIP提出了一种参数高效的多层融合方法，通过将fMRI信号与CLIP中间层和最终层对齐，无需使用VAE管道就能实现高质量的图像解码。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常将fMRI映射到CLIP的最终语义层，并添加参数密集的VAE管道来捕捉视觉细节，但这忽略了CLIP中间层的丰富物体信息，且与大脑功能层次结构不符。

Method: 基于人类视觉系统的功能层次结构，将fMRI信号从不同视觉区域（低/高级）对齐到对应的CLIP中间层和最终层，引入交叉重建策略和新的多粒度损失函数。

Result: 在高级语义指标上达到或超过最先进方法，包括使用VAE管道的方法，同时参数数量减少71.7%，在语义准确性和细节保真度之间取得了良好平衡。

Conclusion: 通过利用CLIP中间特征，BrainMCLIP有效捕捉了CLIP-only方法常遗漏的视觉细节，无需单独VAE管道就能实现竞争性性能，证明了参数效率高的多层融合方法的有效性。

Abstract: Decoding images from fMRI often involves mapping brain activity to CLIP's
final semantic layer. To capture finer visual details, many approaches add a
parameter-intensive VAE-based pipeline. However, these approaches overlook rich
object information within CLIP's intermediate layers and contradicts the
brain's functionally hierarchical. We introduce BrainMCLIP, which pioneers a
parameter-efficient, multi-layer fusion approach guided by human visual
system's functional hierarchy, eliminating the need for such a separate VAE
pathway. BrainMCLIP aligns fMRI signals from functionally distinct visual areas
(low-/high-level) to corresponding intermediate and final CLIP layers,
respecting functional hierarchy. We further introduce a Cross-Reconstruction
strategy and a novel multi-granularity loss. Results show BrainMCLIP achieves
highly competitive performance, particularly excelling on high-level semantic
metrics where it matches or surpasses SOTA(state-of-the-art) methods, including
those using VAE pipelines. Crucially, it achieves this with substantially fewer
parameters, demonstrating a reduction of
71.7\%(Table.\ref{tab:compare_clip_vae}) compared to top VAE-based SOTA
methods, by avoiding the VAE pathway. By leveraging intermediate CLIP features,
it effectively captures visual details often missed by CLIP-only approaches,
striking a compelling balance between semantic accuracy and detail fidelity
without requiring a separate VAE pipeline.

Conclusion: 该框架展示了无需训练的开集图像分割与识别的有效性、灵活性和泛化能力，为计算机视觉任务提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel training-free framework for open-vocabulary image
segmentation and object recognition (OVSR), which leverages EfficientNetB0, a
convolutional neural network, for unsupervised segmentation and CLIP, a
vision-language model, for open-vocabulary object recognition. The proposed
framework adopts a two stage pipeline: unsupervised image segmentation followed
by segment-level recognition via vision-language alignment. In the first stage,
pixel-wise features extracted from EfficientNetB0 are decomposed using singular
value decomposition to obtain latent representations, which are then clustered
using hierarchical clustering to segment semantically meaningful regions. The
number of clusters is adaptively determined by the distribution of singular
values. In the second stage, the segmented regions are localized and encoded
into image embeddings using the Vision Transformer backbone of CLIP. Text
embeddings are precomputed using CLIP's text encoder from category-specific
prompts, including a generic something else prompt to support open set
recognition. The image and text embeddings are concatenated and projected into
a shared latent feature space via SVD to enhance cross-modal alignment.
Recognition is performed by computing the softmax over the similarities between
the projected image and text embeddings. The proposed method is evaluated on
standard benchmarks, including COCO, ADE20K, and PASCAL VOC, achieving
state-of-the-art performance in terms of Hungarian mIoU, precision, recall, and
F1-score. These results demonstrate the effectiveness, flexibility, and
generalizability of the proposed framework.

Conclusion: DaMo能有效优化多任务学习的数据混合配置，具有良好的泛化能力和可扩展性，适用于不同模型架构。

Abstract: Mobile Phone Agents (MPAs) have emerged as a promising research direction due
to their broad applicability across diverse scenarios. While Multimodal Large
Language Models (MLLMs) serve as the foundation for MPAs, their effectiveness
in handling multiple mobile phone tasks simultaneously remains limited.
Although multitask supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is widely adopted for multitask
learning, existing approaches struggle to determine optimal training data
compositions for peak performance. To address this challenge, we propose DaMo
(Data Mixture Optimizer) - a novel solution employing a trainable network that
predicts optimal data mixtures by forecasting downstream task performance for
any given dataset ratio. To support comprehensive evaluation, we introduce
PhoneAgentBench, the first specialized benchmark to evaluate MLLMs on
multimodal mobile phone tasks, comprising 1235 QA pairs spanning diverse
real-world industrial mobile application scenarios. Demonstrating strong
predictive capability (R^2=0.81) in small-scale pilot experiments, DaMo
efficiently extrapolates optimal data mixing configurations. Our results show
DaMo achieves a 3.38% performance improvement on PhoneAgentBench compared to
alternative methods. Furthermore, extensive experiments across established
benchmarks including BFCL-v3, MME-Reasoning, MME-Perception, and OCRBench
reveal DaMo's superior generalization, outperforming other approaches by 2.57%
in terms of average score. When used solely for MLLM optimization on the
BFCL-v3 task, DaMo improves the metrics by 12.47% than other methods. Notably,
DaMo maintains robust scalability, preserving its effectiveness when applied to
other model architectures. The code and dataset are available at

Result: 减轻非物理伪影如折叠，避免过度平滑，提高配准精度和解剖学合理性

Conclusion: DARE框架在医学图像配准中实现了更好的稳定性和解剖学合理性平衡

Abstract: Deformable medical image registration is a fundamental task in medical image
analysis. While deep learning-based methods have demonstrated superior accuracy
and computational efficiency compared to traditional techniques, they often
overlook the critical role of regularization in ensuring robustness and
anatomical plausibility. We propose DARE (Deformable Adaptive Regularization
Estimator), a novel registration framework that dynamically adjusts elastic
regularization based on the gradient norm of the deformation field. Our
approach integrates strain and shear energy terms, which are adaptively
modulated to balance stability and flexibility. To ensure physically realistic
transformations, DARE includes a folding-prevention mechanism that penalizes
regions with negative deformation Jacobian. This strategy mitigates
non-physical artifacts such as folding, avoids over-smoothing, and improves
both registration accuracy and anatomical plausibility

Motivation: 随着NeRF成为3D场景表示和视图合成的强大工具，保护其知识产权免受未经授权使用变得至关重要。

Method: 提出AegisRF框架，包含扰动场向NeRF预渲染输出注入对抗性扰动，以及敏感性场学习空间变化敏感性来自适应约束几何扰动。

Result: 实验评估显示AegisRF在多种下游任务和模态中具有广泛适用性，包括多视图图像分类和基于体素的3D定位，同时保持高视觉保真度。

Conclusion: AegisRF能有效保护NeRF知识产权，在破坏未经授权使用的同时保持渲染质量，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: As Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have emerged as a powerful tool for 3D
scene representation and novel view synthesis, protecting their intellectual
property (IP) from unauthorized use is becoming increasingly crucial. In this
work, we aim to protect the IP of NeRFs by injecting adversarial perturbations
that disrupt their unauthorized applications. However, perturbing the 3D
geometry of NeRFs can easily deform the underlying scene structure and thus
substantially degrade the rendering quality, which has led existing attempts to
avoid geometric perturbations or restrict them to explicit spaces like meshes.
To overcome this limitation, we introduce a learnable sensitivity to quantify
the spatially varying impact of geometric perturbations on rendering quality.
Building upon this, we propose AegisRF, a novel framework that consists of a
Perturbation Field, which injects adversarial perturbations into the
pre-rendering outputs (color and volume density) of NeRF models to fool an
unauthorized downstream target model, and a Sensitivity Field, which learns the
sensitivity to adaptively constrain geometric perturbations, preserving
rendering quality while disrupting unauthorized use. Our experimental
evaluations demonstrate the generalized applicability of AegisRF across diverse
downstream tasks and modalities, including multi-view image classification and
voxel-based 3D localization, while maintaining high visual fidelity. Codes are
available at https://github.com/wkim97/AegisRF.

Motivation: 当前VLM评估主要关注单视角设置，而多摄像头设置已成为机器人平台标准配置，需要评估VLM是否能有效利用多视角输入进行机器人推理。

Method: 构建MV-RoboBench基准，包含8个子任务的1.7k个QA项目，分为空间理解和机器人执行两个主要类别，评估开源和闭源VLM模型以及结合CoT技术的增强版本。

Conclusion: VLM在多视角机器人感知方面面临重大挑战，MV-RoboBench作为开放资源将促进空间基础VLM和VLA的发展，提供标准化评估协议。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) are essential to Embodied AI, enabling robots
to perceive, reason, and act in complex environments. They also serve as the
foundation for the recent Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models. Yet most
evaluations of VLMs focus on single-view settings, leaving their ability to
integrate multi-view information underexplored. At the same time, multi-camera
setups are increasingly standard in robotic platforms, as they provide
complementary perspectives to mitigate occlusion and depth ambiguity. Whether
VLMs can effectively leverage such multi-view inputs for robotic reasoning
therefore remains an open question. To bridge this gap, we introduce
MV-RoboBench, a benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the multi-view
spatial reasoning capabilities of VLMs in robotic manipulation. MV-RoboBench
consists of 1.7k manually curated QA items across eight subtasks, divided into
two primary categories: spatial understanding and robotic execution. We
evaluate a diverse set of existing VLMs, including both open-source and
closed-source models, along with enhanced versions incorporating CoT-inspired
techniques. The results show that state-of-the-art models remain far below
human performance, underscoring the substantial challenges VLMs face in
multi-view robotic perception. Additionally, our analysis uncovers two key
findings: (i) spatial intelligence and robotic task execution are positively
correlated in multi-view robotic scenarios; and (ii) strong performance on
existing general-purpose single-view spatial understanding benchmarks does not
reliably translate to success in the robotic spatial tasks assessed by our
benchmark. We release MV-RoboBench as an open resource to foster progress in
spatially grounded VLMs and VLAs, providing not only data but also a
standardized evaluation protocol for multi-view embodied reasoning.

Abstract: With the spread of e-commerce, the logistics market is growing around the
world. Therefore, improving the efficiency of warehouse operations is
essential. To achieve this, various approaches have been explored, and among
them, the use of digital twins is gaining attention. To make this approach
possible, it is necessary to accurately collect the positions of workers in a
warehouse and reflect them in a virtual space. However, a single camera has
limitations in its field of view, therefore sensing with multiple cameras is
necessary. In this study, we explored a method to track workers using 19
wide-angle cameras installed on the ceiling, looking down at the floor of the
logistics warehouse. To understand the relationship between the camera
coordinates and the actual positions in the warehouse, we performed alignment
based on the floor surface. However, due to the characteristics of wide-angle
cameras, significant distortion occurs at the edges of the image, particularly
in the vertical direction. To address this, the detected worker positions from
each camera were aligned based on foot positions, reducing the effects of image
distortion, and enabling accurate position alignment across cameras. As a
result, we confirmed an improvement of over 20% in tracking accuracy.
Furthermore, we compared multiple methods for utilizing appearance features and
validated the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Abstract: Despite significant advancements in deep classification techniques and in-lab
automatic optical inspection models for long-tailed or highly imbalanced data,
applying these approaches to real-world IC defect classification tasks remains
challenging. This difficulty stems from two primary factors. First, real-world
conditions, such as the high yield-rate requirements in the IC industry, result
in data distributions that are far more skewed than those found in general
public imbalanced datasets. Consequently, classifiers designed for open
imbalanced datasets often fail to perform effectively in real-world scenarios.
Second, real-world samples exhibit a mix of class-specific attributes and
class-agnostic, domain-related features. This complexity adds significant
difficulty to the classification process, particularly for highly imbalanced
datasets. To address these challenges, this paper introduces the IC-Defect-14
dataset, a large, highly imbalanced IC defect image dataset sourced from AOI
systems deployed in real-world IC production lines. This dataset is
characterized by its unique "intra-class clusters" property, which presents two
major challenges: large intra-class diversity and high inter-class similarity.
These characteristics, rarely found simultaneously in existing public datasets,
significantly degrade the performance of current state-of-the-art classifiers
for highly imbalanced data. To tackle this challenge, we propose ReCAME-Net,
which follows a multi-expert classifier framework and integrates a regional
channel attention module, metric learning losses, a hard category mining
strategy, and a knowledge distillation procedure. Extensive experimental
evaluations demonstrate that ReCAME-Net outperforms previous state-of-the-art
models on the IC-Defect-14 dataset while maintaining comparable performance and
competitiveness on general public datasets.

TL;DR: 提出一种多条件生成对抗网络(cGAN)框架，能够生成具有精确控制属性的代表性孔隙尺度图像，解决地下表征中的代表性和数据稀缺问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 获取真正代表整体地层属性的孔隙尺度图像是地下表征的基本挑战，因为自然空间异质性导致提取的子图像与岩心测量值显著偏离，且数据稀缺问题加剧了这一挑战。

Method: 使用多条件生成对抗网络(cGAN)框架，在碳酸盐岩地层的薄片样本上训练，同时以孔隙度值和深度参数作为条件，在单一统一模型中捕获通用孔隙网络原理和深度特定地质特征。

Result: 模型在所有地层中实现了出色的孔隙度控制(R^2=0.95)，平均绝对误差为0.0099-0.0197。形态学验证确认了关键孔隙网络特征的保留，生成图像的代表性误差仅为1.9-11.3%，而随机提取的真实子图像误差为36.4-578%。

Conclusion: 该能力为地下表征提供了变革性工具，特别适用于碳储存、地热能源和地下水管理等应用，其中了解孔隙空间的代表性形态对于实施数字岩石物理至关重要。

Abstract: Obtaining truly representative pore-scale images that match bulk formation
properties remains a fundamental challenge in subsurface characterization, as
natural spatial heterogeneity causes extracted sub-images to deviate
significantly from core-measured values. This challenge is compounded by data
scarcity, where physical samples are only available at sparse well locations.
This study presents a multi-conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN)
framework that generates representative pore-scale images with precisely
controlled properties, addressing both the representativeness challenge and
data availability constraints. The framework was trained on thin section
samples from four depths (1879.50-1943.50 m) of a carbonate formation,
simultaneously conditioning on porosity values and depth parameters within a
single unified model. This approach captures both universal pore network
principles and depth-specific geological characteristics, from grainstone
fabrics with interparticle-intercrystalline porosity to crystalline textures
with anhydrite inclusions. The model achieved exceptional porosity control
(R^2=0.95) across all formations with mean absolute errors of 0.0099-0.0197.
Morphological validation confirmed preservation of critical pore network
characteristics including average pore radius, specific surface area, and
tortuosity, with statistical differences remaining within acceptable geological
tolerances. Most significantly, generated images demonstrated superior
representativeness with dual-constraint errors of 1.9-11.3% compared to
36.4-578% for randomly extracted real sub-images. This capability provides
transformative tools for subsurface characterization, particularly valuable for
carbon storage, geothermal energy, and groundwater management applications
where knowing the representative morphology of the pore space is critical for
implementing digital rock physics.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的MRI加速范式，通过生成模型预测目标对比图像作为数据驱动先验，从图像重建转向预测性成像。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MRI采集时间过长限制了临床吞吐量，需要新的方法来加速MRI扫描过程。

Method: 使用生成模型基于多种数据源（如其他对比图像、历史扫描图像、采集参数等）预测目标对比图像，然后将其作为先验信息来重建高度欠采样的数据。

Result: 在内部和多个公共数据集（总计14,921次扫描；1,051,904个切片）上评估，包括多通道k空间数据，在多种高加速因子（x4、x8和x12）下，该方法显著优于其他方法。

Conclusion: 该框架引入了从图像重建到预测性成像新范式的根本转变。

Abstract: Recent advancements in artificial intelligence have created transformative
capabilities in image synthesis and generation, enabling diverse research
fields to innovate at revolutionary speed and spectrum. In this study, we
leverage this generative power to introduce a new paradigm for accelerating
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), introducing a shift from image reconstruction
to proactive predictive imaging. Despite being a cornerstone of modern patient
care, MRI's lengthy acquisition times limit clinical throughput. Our novel
framework addresses this challenge by first predicting a target contrast image,
which then serves as a data-driven prior for reconstructing highly
under-sampled data. This informative prior is predicted by a generative model
conditioned on diverse data sources, such as other contrast images, previously
scanned images, acquisition parameters, patient information. We demonstrate
this approach with two key applications: (1) reconstructing FLAIR images using
predictions from T1w and/or T2w scans, and (2) reconstructing T1w images using
predictions from previously acquired T1w scans. The framework was evaluated on
internal and multiple public datasets (total 14,921 scans; 1,051,904 slices),
including multi-channel k-space data, for a range of high acceleration factors
(x4, x8 and x12). The results demonstrate that our prediction-prior
reconstruction method significantly outperforms other approaches, including
those with alternative or no prior information. Through this framework we
introduce a fundamental shift from image reconstruction towards a new paradigm
of predictive imaging.

TL;DR: PRGCN是一个新颖的单目3D人体姿态估计框架，通过跨序列模式重用和记忆库机制解决深度模糊问题，在Human3.6M和MPI-INF-3DHP基准上达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频方法仅处理孤立序列，未能利用跨序列中普遍存在的结构规律性和重复运动模式，限制了3D姿态估计的性能提升。

Method: 提出模式重用图卷积网络(PRGCN)，包含图记忆库存储姿态原型，通过注意力机制动态检索，结合Mamba状态空间模型和自注意力的双流混合架构提取时空特征。

Result: 在Human3.6M和MPI-INF-3DHP基准上分别达到37.1mm和13.4mm的MPJPE，展现了增强的跨域泛化能力。

Conclusion: 跨序列模式重用机制对推动该领域发展至关重要，将范式从每序列优化转向累积知识学习。

Abstract: Monocular 3D human pose estimation remains a fundamentally ill-posed inverse
problem due to the inherent depth ambiguity in 2D-to-3D lifting. While
contemporary video-based methods leverage temporal context to enhance spatial
reasoning, they operate under a critical paradigm limitation: processing each
sequence in isolation, thereby failing to exploit the strong structural
regularities and repetitive motion patterns that pervade human movement across
sequences. This work introduces the Pattern Reuse Graph Convolutional Network
(PRGCN), a novel framework that formalizes pose estimation as a problem of
pattern retrieval and adaptation. At its core, PRGCN features a graph memory
bank that learns and stores a compact set of pose prototypes, encoded as
relational graphs, which are dynamically retrieved via an attention mechanism
to provide structured priors. These priors are adaptively fused with hard-coded
anatomical constraints through a memory-driven graph convolution, ensuring
geometrical plausibility. To underpin this retrieval process with robust
spatiotemporal features, we design a dual-stream hybrid architecture that
synergistically combines the linear-complexity, local temporal modeling of
Mamba-based state-space models with the global relational capacity of
self-attention. Extensive evaluations on Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP benchmarks
demonstrate that PRGCN establishes a new state-of-the-art, achieving an MPJPE
of 37.1mm and 13.4mm, respectively, while exhibiting enhanced cross-domain
generalization capability. Our work posits that the long-overlooked mechanism
of cross-sequence pattern reuse is pivotal to advancing the field, shifting the
paradigm from per-sequence optimization towards cumulative knowledge learning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文研究了卫星图像中系统性缺失像素导致的表示偏差问题，提出通过插补和加权重采样方法来消除甲烷羽流检测中标签与覆盖率之间的虚假关联。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 卫星图像存在系统性缺失像素（如云层遮挡），这些非随机缺失数据会导致自动化特征提取模型出现表示偏差，特别是在甲烷羽流检测中，模型可能错误地将图像覆盖率与标签关联起来。

Method: 评估了多种插补方法，并提出在训练期间使用加权重采样方案，通过在每个覆盖率区间强制类别平衡来消除标签与覆盖率之间的关联。

Result: 重采样和插补方法都能显著减少表示偏差，同时不会损害平衡准确率、精确率或召回率。去偏模型在低覆盖率图像中检测羽流的概率更高。

Conclusion: 提出的去偏方法有效解决了卫星图像中系统性缺失像素导致的表示偏差问题，提高了模型在低覆盖率图像中的检测性能。

Abstract: Most satellite images have systematically missing pixels (i.e., missing data
not at random (MNAR)) due to factors such as clouds. If not addressed, these
missing pixels can lead to representation bias in automated feature extraction
models. In this work, we show that spurious association between the label and
the number of missing values in methane plume detection can cause the model to
associate the coverage (i.e., the percentage of valid pixels in an image) with
the label, subsequently under-detecting plumes in low-coverage images. We
evaluate multiple imputation approaches to remove the dependence between the
coverage and a label. Additionally, we propose a weighted resampling scheme
during training that removes the association between the label and the coverage
by enforcing class balance in each coverage bin. Our results show that both
resampling and imputation can significantly reduce the representation bias
without hurting balanced accuracy, precision, or recall. Finally, we evaluate
the capability of the debiased models using these techniques in an operational
scenario and demonstrate that the debiased models have a higher chance of
detecting plumes in low-coverage images.

Motivation: 解决单源域泛化目标检测中模型过度依赖伪相关特征（如颜色）而非本质域不变特征（如物体轮廓）的问题。

Method: 提出Cauvis方法：1）跨注意力提示模块整合视觉提示与跨注意力来减轻伪特征偏差；2）双分支适配器通过高频特征提取实现因果-伪特征解耦和域适应。

Result: 在SDGOD数据集上比现有域泛化方法提升15.9-31.4%，在复杂干扰环境中表现出显著鲁棒性优势。

Conclusion: Cauvis方法有效解决了单源域泛化目标检测中的伪相关性问题，实现了优越的泛化性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Single-source Domain Generalized Object Detection (SDGOD), as a cutting-edge
research topic in computer vision, aims to enhance model generalization
capability in unseen target domains through single-source domain training.
Current mainstream approaches attempt to mitigate domain discrepancies via data
augmentation techniques. However, due to domain shift and limited
domain-specific knowledge, models tend to fall into the pitfall of spurious
correlations. This manifests as the model's over-reliance on simplistic
classification features (e.g., color) rather than essential domain-invariant
representations like object contours. To address this critical challenge, we
propose the Cauvis (Causal Visual Prompts) method. First, we introduce a
Cross-Attention Prompts module that mitigates bias from spurious features by
integrating visual prompts with cross-attention. To address the inadequate
domain knowledge coverage and spurious feature entanglement in visual prompts
for single-domain generalization, we propose a dual-branch adapter that
disentangles causal-spurious features while achieving domain adaptation via
high-frequency feature extraction. Cauvis achieves state-of-the-art performance
with 15.9-31.4% gains over existing domain generalization methods on SDGOD
datasets, while exhibiting significant robustness advantages in complex
interference environments.

TL;DR: CARES是一个轻量级预处理模块，通过预测图像-查询对的最小足够输入分辨率，在保持任务性能的同时将计算量减少高达80%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型通常以原生或高分辨率处理图像，导致视觉token占总token的97-99%，造成高计算成本和延迟，即使低分辨率图像就足够。

Method: 使用紧凑VLM（350M）提取特征并预测目标预训练VLM响应何时收敛到其正确回答能力的峰值，作为离散分类器训练但可在推理时插值连续分辨率。

Result: 在五个涵盖文档和自然图像的多模态基准测试中，CARES保持任务性能的同时将计算量减少高达80%。

Conclusion: CARES通过智能选择最小足够分辨率，有效解决了VLM中视觉token过多导致的计算效率问题。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) commonly process images at native or high
resolution to remain effective across tasks. This inflates visual tokens ofter
to 97-99% of total tokens, resulting in high compute and latency, even when
low-resolution images would suffice. We introduce \emph{CARES}-a
\textbf{C}ontext-\textbf{A}ware \textbf{R}esolution \textbf{S}elector, a
lightweight preprocessing module that, given an image-query pair, predicts the
\emph{minimal} sufficient input resolution. CARES uses a compact VLM (350M) to
extract features and predict when a target pretrained VLM's response converges
to its peak ability to answer correctly. Though trained as a discrete
classifier over a set of optional resolutions, CARES interpolates continuous
resolutions at inference for fine-grained control. Across five multimodal
benchmarks spanning documents and natural images, as well as diverse target
VLMs, CARES preserves task performance while reducing compute by up to 80%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在处理小重叠或无重叠图像对时表现不佳，视频插值生成的中间帧模糊且选择策略效率低。

Method: 使用混合视频生成(HVG)结合视频插值和姿态条件新视角合成模型生成清晰中间帧，并通过特征匹配选择器(FMS)选择适合姿态估计的帧。

Result: 在Cambridge Landmarks、ScanNet、DL3DV-10K和NAVI数据集上的实验表明，相比现有SOTA方法，PoseCrafter显著提升了姿态估计性能。

Conclusion: PoseCrafter有效解决了稀疏重叠图像对的相机姿态估计问题，特别在小重叠或无重叠情况下表现优异。

Abstract: Pairwise camera pose estimation from sparsely overlapping image pairs remains
a critical and unsolved challenge in 3D vision. Most existing methods struggle
with image pairs that have small or no overlap. Recent approaches attempt to
address this by synthesizing intermediate frames using video interpolation and
selecting key frames via a self-consistency score. However, the generated
frames are often blurry due to small overlap inputs, and the selection
strategies are slow and not explicitly aligned with pose estimation. To solve
these cases, we propose Hybrid Video Generation (HVG) to synthesize clearer
intermediate frames by coupling a video interpolation model with a
pose-conditioned novel view synthesis model, where we also propose a Feature
Matching Selector (FMS) based on feature correspondence to select intermediate
frames appropriate for pose estimation from the synthesized results. Extensive
experiments on Cambridge Landmarks, ScanNet, DL3DV-10K, and NAVI demonstrate
that, compared to existing SOTA methods, PoseCrafter can obviously enhance the
pose estimation performances, especially on examples with small or no overlap.

TL;DR: 本文研究了视觉语言模型在计数任务中的局限性，发现模型对物体数量、类型、空间排列和干扰物高度敏感。通过层间分析发现错误主要源于最后一层表征到输出空间的映射问题，仅微调输出层即可提升准确率21%。

Motivation: 虽然视觉语言模型在下游任务中表现良好，但在视觉推理方面仍存在诸多限制，如难以识别关系、理解时间序列和计数物体。本文旨在超越基准评估，深入探究模型失败的根本原因并针对性提升其推理能力。

Method: 在受控实验条件下研究7个最先进视觉语言模型的计数能力，进行层间分析以识别错误来源，并采用针对性训练方法仅微调输出层。

Result: 实验显示视觉语言模型对物体数量、类型、空间排列和干扰物高度敏感。层间分析表明错误主要来自最后一层表征到输出空间的映射问题。仅微调输出层可使准确率提升高达21%，并在真实数据集上获得一致改进。

Conclusion: 视觉语言模型在计数任务中的失败主要源于输出层映射问题，而非深层表征缺陷。通过针对性微调输出层可显著提升模型性能，这为改进视觉语言模型的推理能力提供了有效途径。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have recently gained attention due to their
competitive performance on multiple downstream tasks, achieved by following
user-input instructions. However, VLMs still exhibit several limitations in
visual reasoning, such as difficulties in identifying relations (e.g., spatial,
temporal, and among objects), understanding temporal sequences (e.g., frames),
and counting objects. In this work, we go beyond score-level benchmark
evaluations of VLMs by investigating the underlying causes of their failures
and proposing a targeted approach to improve their reasoning capabilities. We
study the reasoning skills of seven state-of-the-art VLMs in the counting task
under controlled experimental conditions. Our experiments show that VLMs are
highly sensitive to the number and type of objects, their spatial arrangement,
and the co-occurrence of distractors. A layer-wise analysis reveals that errors
are due to incorrect mapping of the last-layer representation into the output
space. Our targeted training shows that fine-tuning just the output layer
improves accuracy by up to 21%. We corroborate these findings by achieving
consistent improvements on real-world datasets.

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models offer great potential for creating virtually
limitless synthetic data, a valuable resource compared to fixed and finite real
datasets. Previous works evaluate the utility of synthetic data from T2I models
on three key desiderata: quality, diversity, and consistency. While prompt
engineering is the primary means of interacting with T2I models, the systematic
impact of prompt complexity on these critical utility axes remains
underexplored. In this paper, we first conduct synthetic experiments to
motivate the difficulty of generalization w.r.t. prompt complexity and explain
the observed difficulty with theoretical derivations. Then, we introduce a new
evaluation framework that can compare the utility of real data and synthetic
data, and present a comprehensive analysis of how prompt complexity influences
the utility of synthetic data generated by commonly used T2I models. We conduct
our study across diverse datasets, including CC12M, ImageNet-1k, and DCI, and
evaluate different inference-time intervention methods. Our synthetic
experiments show that generalizing to more general conditions is harder than
the other way round, since the former needs an estimated likelihood that is not
learned by diffusion models. Our large-scale empirical experiments reveal that
increasing prompt complexity results in lower conditional diversity and prompt
consistency, while reducing the synthetic-to-real distribution shift, which
aligns with the synthetic experiments. Moreover, current inference-time
interventions can augment the diversity of the generations at the expense of
moving outside the support of real data. Among those interventions, prompt
expansion, by deliberately using a pre-trained language model as a likelihood
estimator, consistently achieves the highest performance in both image
diversity and aesthetics, even higher than that of real data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RGB相机和事件相机具有互补优势（RGB提供高空间分辨率和纹理细节，事件相机提供高时间分辨率和HDR），但两者成像机制不同导致显著的时空不对称，阻碍了有效的多模态融合。

Method: HAD多模态知识蒸馏框架，通过分层对齐策略显式建模和缓解时空不对称，在保持学生网络计算效率和参数紧凑性的同时最小化信息损失。

Result: 大量实验表明HAD持续优于最先进方法，全面的消融研究验证了每个设计组件的有效性和必要性。

Conclusion: HAD框架成功解决了RGB和事件相机之间的时空不对称问题，显著提升了多模态目标跟踪性能，特别是在高速运动、HDR环境和动态背景干扰等挑战性条件下。

Abstract: RGB cameras excel at capturing rich texture details with high spatial
resolution, whereas event cameras offer exceptional temporal resolution and a
high dynamic range (HDR). Leveraging their complementary strengths can
substantially enhance object tracking under challenging conditions, such as
high-speed motion, HDR environments, and dynamic background interference.
However, a significant spatio-temporal asymmetry exists between these two
modalities due to their fundamentally different imaging mechanisms, hindering
effective multi-modal integration. To address this issue, we propose
{Hierarchical Asymmetric Distillation} (HAD), a multi-modal knowledge
distillation framework that explicitly models and mitigates spatio-temporal
asymmetries. Specifically, HAD proposes a hierarchical alignment strategy that
minimizes information loss while maintaining the student network's
computational efficiency and parameter compactness. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that HAD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, and
comprehensive ablation studies further validate the effectiveness and necessity
of each designed component. The code will be released soon.

Motivation: 随着目标检测模型在自动驾驶和监控系统等网络物理系统中的部署增加，确保其对抗威胁的安全性至关重要。现有研究主要关注图像域的对抗攻击，而视频域特别是无盒设置下的攻击研究较少。

Method: 利用RGBA视频的alpha通道将恶意目标视频与良性视频融合，设计融合算法确保视觉隐蔽性和兼容性，无需访问模型架构、参数或输出。

Result: 在五种最先进的目标检测器、一个视觉语言模型和一个多模态大语言模型(Gemini-2.0-Flash)上评估，所有场景下攻击成功率均达到100%。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了视频感知系统中一个先前未被探索的漏洞，强调了在对抗设置中考虑alpha通道的防御措施的紧迫需求。

Abstract: As object detection models are increasingly deployed in cyber-physical
systems such as autonomous vehicles (AVs) and surveillance platforms, ensuring
their security against adversarial threats is essential. While prior work has
explored adversarial attacks in the image domain, those attacks in the video
domain remain largely unexamined, especially in the no-box setting. In this
paper, we present {\alpha}-Cloak, the first no-box adversarial attack on object
detectors that operates entirely through the alpha channel of RGBA videos.
{\alpha}-Cloak exploits the alpha channel to fuse a malicious target video with
a benign video, resulting in a fused video that appears innocuous to human
viewers but consistently fools object detectors. Our attack requires no access
to model architecture, parameters, or outputs, and introduces no perceptible
artifacts. We systematically study the support for alpha channels across common
video formats and playback applications, and design a fusion algorithm that
ensures visual stealth and compatibility. We evaluate {\alpha}-Cloak on five
state-of-the-art object detectors, a vision-language model, and a multi-modal
large language model (Gemini-2.0-Flash), demonstrating a 100% attack success
rate across all scenarios. Our findings reveal a previously unexplored
vulnerability in video-based perception systems, highlighting the urgent need
for defenses that account for the alpha channel in adversarial settings.

Conclusion: VGD验证了可扩展性和高保真环绕视角重建能力，通过几何引导的语义优化有效提升了新视角渲染质量。

Abstract: Feed-forward surround-view autonomous driving scene reconstruction offers
fast, generalizable inference ability, which faces the core challenge of
ensuring generalization while elevating novel view quality. Due to the
surround-view with minimal overlap regions, existing methods typically fail to
ensure geometric consistency and reconstruction quality for novel views. To
tackle this tension, we claim that geometric information must be learned
explicitly, and the resulting features should be leveraged to guide the
elevating of semantic quality in novel views. In this paper, we introduce
\textbf{Visual Gaussian Driving (VGD)}, a novel feed-forward end-to-end
learning framework designed to address this challenge. To achieve generalizable
geometric estimation, we design a lightweight variant of the VGGT architecture
to efficiently distill its geometric priors from the pre-trained VGGT to the
geometry branch. Furthermore, we design a Gaussian Head that fuses multi-scale
geometry tokens to predict Gaussian parameters for novel view rendering, which
shares the same patch backbone as the geometry branch. Finally, we integrate
multi-scale features from both geometry and Gaussian head branches to jointly
supervise a semantic refinement model, optimizing rendering quality through
feature-consistent learning. Experiments on nuScenes demonstrate that our
approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both objective
metrics and subjective quality under various settings, which validates VGD's
scalability and high-fidelity surround-view reconstruction.

Abstract: Multi-modal co-learning is emerging as an effective paradigm in machine
learning, enabling models to collaboratively learn from different modalities to
enhance single-modality predictions. Earth Observation (EO) represents a
quintessential domain for multi-modal data analysis, wherein diverse remote
sensors collect data to sense our planet. This unprecedented volume of data
introduces novel challenges. Specifically, the access to the same sensor
modalities at both training and inference stages becomes increasingly complex
based on real-world constraints affecting remote sensing platforms. In this
context, multi-modal co-learning presents a promising strategy to leverage the
vast amount of sensor-derived data available at the training stage to improve
single-modality models for inference-time deployment. Most current research
efforts focus on designing customized solutions for either particular
downstream tasks or specific modalities available at the inference stage. To
address this, we propose a novel multi-modal co-learning framework capable of
generalizing across various tasks without targeting a specific modality for
inference. Our approach combines contrastive and modality discriminative
learning together to guide single-modality models to structure the internal
model manifold into modality-shared and modality-specific information. We
evaluate our framework on four EO benchmarks spanning classification and
regression tasks across different sensor modalities, where only one of the
modalities available during training is accessible at inference time. Our
results demonstrate consistent predictive improvements over state-of-the-art
approaches from the recent machine learning and computer vision literature, as
well as EO-specific methods. The obtained findings validate our framework in
the single-modality inference scenarios across a diverse range of EO
applications.

Abstract: Multi-focus image fusion (MFIF) addresses the depth-of-field (DOF)
limitations of optical lenses, where only objects within a specific range
appear sharp. Although traditional and deep learning methods have advanced the
field, challenges persist, including limited training data, domain gaps from
synthetic datasets, and difficulties with regions lacking information. We
propose VAEEDOF, a novel MFIF method that uses a distilled variational
autoencoder for high-fidelity, efficient image reconstruction. Our fusion
module processes up to seven images simultaneously, enabling robust fusion
across diverse focus points. To address data scarcity, we introduce
MattingMFIF, a new syntetic 4K dataset, simulating realistic DOF effects from
real photographs. Our method achieves state-of-the-art results, generating
seamless artifact-free fused images and bridging the gap between synthetic and
real-world scenarios, offering a significant step forward in addressing complex
MFIF challenges. The code, and weights are available here:

Abstract: This paper investigates methods for estimating uncertainty in semantic
segmentation predictions derived from satellite imagery. Estimating uncertainty
for segmentation presents unique challenges compared to standard image
classification, requiring scalable methods producing per-pixel estimates. While
most research on this topic has focused on scene understanding or medical
imaging, this work benchmarks existing methods specifically for remote sensing
and Earth observation applications. Our evaluation focuses on the practical
utility of uncertainty measures, testing their ability to identify prediction
errors and noise-corrupted input image regions. Experiments are conducted on
two remote sensing datasets, PASTIS and ForTy, selected for their differences
in scale, geographic coverage, and label confidence. We perform an extensive
evaluation featuring several models, such as Stochastic Segmentation Networks
and ensembles, in combination with a number of neural architectures and
uncertainty metrics. We make a number of practical recommendations based on our

*Su Ho Han,Jeongseok Hyun,Pilhyeon Lee,Minho Shim,Dongyoon Wee,Seon Joo Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出DecAF方法，通过分解注意力融合机制将MLLM的注意力图直接转换为分割掩码，无需训练即可实现视频推理分割。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在视频理解方面表现强大，但其原始注意力图存在噪声且与对象区域对齐不佳，需要一种无需训练的方法来改进注意力图以实现精确定位。

Method: 提出分解注意力融合（DecAF），包含对比性对象-背景融合和互补视频帧融合两种机制，结合注意力引导的SAM2提示来获得细粒度掩码。

Result: DecAF在无需训练的方法中表现优异，在引用和推理VOS基准测试中达到与基于训练方法相当的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法成功实现了无需重新训练MLLM的视频推理分割，通过注意力图优化获得了高质量的分割结果。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) demonstrate strong video
understanding by attending to visual tokens relevant to textual queries. To
directly adapt this for localization in a training-free manner, we cast video
reasoning segmentation as a video QA task and extract attention maps via
rollout mechanism. However, raw attention maps are noisy and poorly aligned
with object regions. We propose Decomposed Attention Fusion (DecAF), which
refines these maps through two mechanisms: (1) contrastive object-background
fusion and (2) complementary video-frame fusion. This method suppresses
irrelevant activations and enhances object-focused cues, enabling direct
conversion of attention maps into coarse segmentation masks. In addition, we
introduce attention-guided SAM2 prompting for obtaining fine-grained masks.
Unlike existing methods that jointly train MLLMs with SAM, our method operates
entirely without retraining. DecAF outperforms training-free methods and
achieves performance comparable to training-based methods on both referring and
reasoning VOS benchmarks. The code will be available at
https://github.com/HYUNJS/DecAF.

TL;DR: 提出CBDiff模型，通过生成多个多样的伪造定位图来增强图像伪造定位的可信度，采用伯努利噪声和时序交叉注意力机制提升检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像伪造定位方法通常生成单一确定性定位图，缺乏高精度和可靠性，难以满足法医分析和安全监控等高风险应用的需求。

Method: 提出条件伯努利扩散模型(CBDiff)，生成多个多样的伪造定位图；引入伯努利噪声以反映伪造掩码的二元稀疏特性；设计时序交叉注意力机制(TSCAttention)利用语义特征和时间步长指导检测。

Result: 在8个公开基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，CBDiff显著优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: CBDiff通过生成多个定位图和引入创新机制，显著提升了图像伪造定位的性能和可靠性，具有实际部署的强潜力。

Abstract: Image Forgery Localization (IFL) is a crucial task in image forensics, aimed
at accurately identifying manipulated or tampered regions within an image at
the pixel level. Existing methods typically generate a single deterministic
localization map, which often lacks the precision and reliability required for
high-stakes applications such as forensic analysis and security surveillance.
To enhance the credibility of predictions and mitigate the risk of errors, we
introduce an advanced Conditional Bernoulli Diffusion Model (CBDiff). Given a
forged image, CBDiff generates multiple diverse and plausible localization
maps, thereby offering a richer and more comprehensive representation of the
forgery distribution. This approach addresses the uncertainty and variability
inherent in tampered regions. Furthermore, CBDiff innovatively incorporates
Bernoulli noise into the diffusion process to more faithfully reflect the
inherent binary and sparse properties of forgery masks. Additionally, CBDiff
introduces a Time-Step Cross-Attention (TSCAttention), which is specifically
designed to leverage semantic feature guidance with temporal steps to improve
manipulation detection. Extensive experiments on eight publicly benchmark
datasets demonstrate that CBDiff significantly outperforms existing
state-of-the-art methods, highlighting its strong potential for real-world
deployment.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了首个系统性基准XBench，用于评估胸部X射线中跨模态可解释性，发现当前视觉语言模型在医学图像中的定位能力存在局限性，特别是在小病灶和弥散性病变方面表现不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然视觉语言模型在医学图像理解中表现出色，但其在医学领域中的可靠定位能力（文本概念与视觉证据的对齐程度）尚未充分探索，而这对临床可解释性和采用至关重要。

Method: 使用七种CLIP风格的视觉语言模型变体，通过交叉注意力和基于相似性的定位图生成视觉解释，并定量评估它们与放射科医生标注区域在多病理情况下的对齐程度。

Result: 研究发现：(1)所有模型对大型明确病变定位合理，但对小型或弥散性病变性能显著下降；(2)在胸部X射线特定数据集上预训练的模型比对通用领域数据训练的模型表现出更好的对齐；(3)模型整体识别能力与定位能力强相关。

Conclusion: 当前视觉语言模型尽管具有强大的识别能力，但在临床可靠定位方面仍存在不足，强调了在医学实践中部署前需要进行有针对性的可解释性基准测试的重要性。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have recently shown remarkable zero-shot
performance in medical image understanding, yet their grounding ability, the
extent to which textual concepts align with visual evidence, remains
underexplored. In the medical domain, however, reliable grounding is essential
for interpretability and clinical adoption. In this work, we present the first
systematic benchmark for evaluating cross-modal interpretability in chest
X-rays across seven CLIP-style VLM variants. We generate visual explanations
using cross-attention and similarity-based localization maps, and
quantitatively assess their alignment with radiologist-annotated regions across
multiple pathologies. Our analysis reveals that: (1) while all VLM variants
demonstrate reasonable localization for large and well-defined pathologies,
their performance substantially degrades for small or diffuse lesions; (2)
models that are pretrained on chest X-ray-specific datasets exhibit improved
alignment compared to those trained on general-domain data. (3) The overall
recognition ability and grounding ability of the model are strongly correlated.
These findings underscore that current VLMs, despite their strong recognition
ability, still fall short in clinically reliable grounding, highlighting the
need for targeted interpretability benchmarks before deployment in medical
practice. XBench code is available at

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于散射系数的去噪方法，通过联合最小化和最大化不同散射系数子集的ℓ¹范数来抑制高斯噪声，该方法能够适应复杂的信号规律性，并在数值实验中达到了卡通图像的最小化渐近界。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的稀疏估计器在框架中不够丰富，无法适应复杂的信号规律性。对于边缘为分段C^α曲线的卡通图像，当Lipschitz指数α≤2是未知参数时，小波、曲波和Xlet框架都是次优的。深度卷积神经网络虽然取得了更好的数值结果，但需要更简化的模型。

Method: 引入散射系数作为简化的卷积神经网络模型，通过对小波系数模进行第二次小波变换计算得到。提出去噪估计器，通过联合最小化和最大化不同散射系数子集的ℓ¹范数来实现去噪。

Result: 证明了这些ℓ¹范数能够捕捉不同类型的几何图像规律性。数值实验表明，该去噪估计器对于所有Lipschitz指数α≤2的卡通图像都达到了最小化渐近界。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种不同的调和分析方法来抑制信号噪声并指定函数的几何规律性，同时在调和分析与深度卷积网络去噪估计器之间建立了数学桥梁。

Abstract: A considerable amount of research in harmonic analysis has been devoted to
non-linear estimators of signals contaminated by additive Gaussian noise. They
are implemented by thresholding coefficients in a frame, which provide a sparse
signal representation, or by minimising their $\ell^1$ norm. However, sparse
estimators in frames are not sufficiently rich to adapt to complex signal
regularities. For cartoon images whose edges are piecewise $\bf C^\alpha$
curves, wavelet, curvelet and Xlet frames are suboptimal if the Lipschitz
exponent $\alpha \leq 2$ is an unknown parameter. Deep convolutional neural
networks have recently obtained much better numerical results, which reach the
minimax asymptotic bounds for all $\alpha$. Wavelet scattering coefficients
have been introduced as simplified convolutional neural network models. They
are computed by transforming the modulus of wavelet coefficients with a second
wavelet transform. We introduce a denoising estimator by jointly minimising and
maximising the $\ell^1$ norms of different subsets of scattering coefficients.
We prove that these $\ell^1$ norms capture different types of geometric image
regularity. Numerical experiments show that this denoising estimator reaches
the minimax asymptotic bound for cartoon images for all Lipschitz exponents
$\alpha \leq 2$. We state this numerical result as a mathematical conjecture.
It provides a different harmonic analysis approach to suppress noise from
signals, and to specify the geometric regularity of functions. It also opens a
mathematical bridge between harmonic analysis and denoising estimators with
deep convolutional network.

TL;DR: GenComm提出了一种生成式通信机制，通过特征生成实现异构多智能体系统的无缝感知，无需修改原始网络，并采用轻量级空间信息数值对齐以最小成本高效集成新智能体。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实应用中，异构智能体在传感器和模型上的差异导致协作时出现领域差距。现有基于适应和重构的方法存在两个关键限制：(1)编码器或核心模块的侵入式重训练破坏了智能体间已建立的语义一致性；(2)容纳新智能体计算成本高，限制了可扩展性。

Result: 在OPV2V-H、DAIR-V2X和V2X-Real数据集上的实验表明，GenComm优于现有最先进方法，在集成新智能体时计算成本和参数数量均减少81%。

Conclusion: GenComm通过生成式通信有效解决了异构多智能体协作中的领域差距问题，实现了高效、可扩展的感知协作。

Abstract: Multi-agent collaboration enhances the perception capabilities of individual
agents through information sharing. However, in real-world applications,
differences in sensors and models across heterogeneous agents inevitably lead
to domain gaps during collaboration. Existing approaches based on adaptation
and reconstruction fail to support pragmatic heterogeneous collaboration due to
two key limitations: (1) Intrusive retraining of the encoder or core modules
disrupts the established semantic consistency among agents; and (2)
accommodating new agents incurs high computational costs, limiting scalability.
To address these challenges, we present a novel Generative Communication
mechanism (GenComm) that facilitates seamless perception across heterogeneous
multi-agent systems through feature generation, without altering the original
network, and employs lightweight numerical alignment of spatial information to
efficiently integrate new agents at minimal cost. Specifically, a tailored
Deformable Message Extractor is designed to extract spatial message for each
collaborator, which is then transmitted in place of intermediate features. The
Spatial-Aware Feature Generator, utilizing a conditional diffusion model,
generates features aligned with the ego agent's semantic space while preserving
the spatial information of the collaborators. These generated features are
further refined by a Channel Enhancer before fusion. Experiments conducted on
the OPV2V-H, DAIR-V2X and V2X-Real datasets demonstrate that GenComm
outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, achieving an 81\% reduction in
both computational cost and parameter count when incorporating new agents. Our
code is available at https://github.com/jeffreychou777/GenComm.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有时刻检索方法面临数据稀缺、边界模糊和细粒度语义区分不足三大瓶颈，导致模型陷入局部最优，缺乏鲁棒的边界和语义区分能力。

Method: 提出两阶段训练框架：冷启动阶段使用课程学习在增强数据上建立基础边界/语义意识；蒸馏阶段引入双查询集（原始查询和主动查询），通过跨阶段蒸馏损失保持知识一致性。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，AMR相比现有最先进方法取得了性能提升。

Conclusion: AMR框架通过零外部依赖的增强方法有效解决了时刻检索中的关键瓶颈，显著提升了边界和语义区分能力，在真实场景中具有良好的泛化性能。

Abstract: Existing Moment Retrieval methods face three critical bottlenecks: (1) data
scarcity forces models into shallow keyword-feature associations; (2) boundary
ambiguity in transition regions between adjacent events; (3) insufficient
discrimination of fine-grained semantics (e.g., distinguishing ``kicking" vs.
``throwing" a ball). In this paper, we propose a zero-external-dependency
Augmented Moment Retrieval framework, AMR, designed to overcome local optima
caused by insufficient data annotations and the lack of robust boundary and
semantic discrimination capabilities. AMR is built upon two key insights: (1)
it resolves ambiguous boundary information and semantic confusion in existing
annotations without additional data (avoiding costly manual labeling), and (2)
it preserves boundary and semantic discriminative capabilities enhanced by
training while generalizing to real-world scenarios, significantly improving
performance. Furthermore, we propose a two-stage training framework with
cold-start and distillation adaptation. The cold-start stage employs curriculum
learning on augmented data to build foundational boundary/semantic awareness.
The distillation stage introduces dual query sets: Original Queries maintain
DETR-based localization using frozen Base Queries from the cold-start model,
while Active Queries dynamically adapt to real-data distributions. A
cross-stage distillation loss enforces consistency between Original and Base
Queries, preventing knowledge forgetting while enabling real-world
generalization. Experiments on multiple benchmarks show that AMR achieves
improved performance over prior state-of-the-art approaches.

Motivation: 通用视觉语言模型在医疗领域表现不佳，主要由于缺乏大规模高质量医疗影像数据集和忽视了从粗到细的诊断过程。

Method: 构建CT-RATE-VQA数据集（84K QA对），提出MedReason-R1模型，嵌入放大病灶区域，并引入GRPO强化学习框架。

Result: MedReason-R1在CT疾病诊断中达到最先进性能，同时保持泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该方法通过显式推理过程和强化学习，有效提升了医疗视觉语言模型的诊断性能。

Abstract: General-purpose large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) demonstrate strong
capabilities in generating detailed descriptions for natural images. However,
their performance in the medical domain remains suboptimal, even for relatively
straightforward tasks, primarily due to the lack of large-scale, high-quality,
specialized medical imaging datasets and the neglect of the diagnostic process
that progresses from coarse to fine-grained. To address the first issue, we
construct the CT-RATE-VQA dataset, which has 84K QA pairs. For the second
issue, we propose MedReason-R1, a medical VLM with explicit reasoning process
for disease diagnosis. MedReason-R1 incorporates a novel strategy that embeds
zoom-in disease region-of-interest areas into the image, highlighting the
crucial role of both global localization and disease-specific details in
enhancing the model's diagnostic performance. Furthermore, we introduce the
GRPO reinforcement learning framework to MedReason-R1, which enables effective
reasoning without relying on costly manual annotations. Compared to recent
general-purpose and medical VLMs, MedReason-R1 achieves state-of-the-art
performance in CT disease diagnosis while retaining generalization. The code,

TL;DR: ReAct-GS通过重要性感知的致密化准则和参数扰动重新激活机制，解决了3D高斯泼溅中的过重建伪影问题，在保持几何细节的同时实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D高斯泼溅在复杂场景中会出现过重建伪影，表现为局部模糊和针状扭曲。现有方法归因于大规模高斯分布分割不足，但本文识别出两个根本限制：致密化过程中的梯度幅度稀释和原始冻结现象。

Method: 提出ReAct-GS方法，包含：(1)重要性感知致密化准则，结合多视角的α混合权重来重新激活复杂区域中停滞的原始增长；(2)重新激活机制，通过自适应参数扰动来激活冻结的原始分布。

Result: 在多样化真实世界数据集上的综合实验表明，ReAct-GS有效消除了过重建伪影，在标准新视角合成指标上达到最先进性能，同时保持了精细的几何细节。重新激活机制在其他3D-GS变体中也带来一致改进。

Conclusion: ReAct-GS通过重新激活原则成功解决了3D高斯泼溅中的过重建问题，其机制具有广泛的适用性，能够提升多种3D-GS变体的性能。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) achieves real-time photorealistic novel view
synthesis, yet struggles with complex scenes due to over-reconstruction
artifacts, manifesting as local blurring and needle-shape distortions. While
recent approaches attribute these issues to insufficient splitting of
large-scale Gaussians, we identify two fundamental limitations: gradient
magnitude dilution during densification and the primitive frozen phenomenon,
where essential Gaussian densification is inhibited in complex regions while
suboptimally scaled Gaussians become trapped in local optima. To address these
challenges, we introduce ReAct-GS, a method founded on the principle of
re-activation. Our approach features: (1) an importance-aware densification
criterion incorporating $\alpha$-blending weights from multiple viewpoints to
re-activate stalled primitive growth in complex regions, and (2) a
re-activation mechanism that revitalizes frozen primitives through adaptive
parameter perturbations. Comprehensive experiments across diverse real-world
datasets demonstrate that ReAct-GS effectively eliminates over-reconstruction
artifacts and achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard novel view
synthesis metrics while preserving intricate geometric details. Additionally,
our re-activation mechanism yields consistent improvements when integrated with
other 3D-GS variants such as Pixel-GS, demonstrating its broad applicability.

Abstract: Despite remarkable progress in driving world models, their potential for
autonomous systems remains largely untapped: the world models are mostly
learned for world simulation and decoupled from trajectory planning. While
recent efforts aim to unify world modeling and planning in a single framework,
the synergistic facilitation mechanism of world modeling for planning still
requires further exploration. In this work, we introduce a new driving paradigm
named Policy World Model (PWM), which not only integrates world modeling and
trajectory planning within a unified architecture, but is also able to benefit
planning using the learned world knowledge through the proposed action-free
future state forecasting scheme. Through collaborative state-action prediction,
PWM can mimic the human-like anticipatory perception, yielding more reliable
planning performance. To facilitate the efficiency of video forecasting, we
further introduce a dynamically enhanced parallel token generation mechanism,
equipped with a context-guided tokenizer and an adaptive dynamic focal loss.
Despite utilizing only front camera input, our method matches or exceeds
state-of-the-art approaches that rely on multi-view and multi-modal inputs.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) achieve strong performance on
vision-language tasks, yet their visual processing is opaque. Most black-box
evaluations measure task accuracy, but reveal little about underlying
mechanisms. Drawing on cognitive psychology, we adapt classic visual search
paradigms -- originally developed to study human perception -- to test whether
MLLMs exhibit the ``pop-out'' effect, where salient visual features are
detected independently of distractor set size. Using controlled experiments
targeting colour, size and lighting features, we find that advanced MLLMs
exhibit human-like pop-out effects in colour or size-based disjunctive (single
feature) search, as well as capacity limits for conjunctive (multiple feature)
search. We also find evidence to suggest that MLLMs, like humans, incorporate
natural scene priors such as lighting direction into object representations. We
reinforce our findings using targeted fine-tuning and mechanistic
interpretability analyses. Our work shows how visual search can serve as a
cognitively grounded diagnostic tool for evaluating perceptual capabilities in
MLLMs.

Abstract: Unpaired image-to-image translation has emerged as a crucial technique in
medical imaging, enabling cross-modality synthesis, domain adaptation, and data
augmentation without costly paired datasets. Yet, existing approaches often
distort fine curvilinear structures, such as microvasculature, undermining both
diagnostic reliability and quantitative analysis. This limitation is
consequential in ophthalmic and vascular imaging, where subtle morphological
changes carry significant clinical meaning. We propose Curvilinear
Structure-preserving Translation (CST), a general framework that explicitly
preserves fine curvilinear structures during unpaired translation by
integrating structure consistency into the training. Specifically, CST augments
baseline models with a curvilinear extraction module for topological
supervision. It can be seamlessly incorporated into existing methods. We
integrate it into CycleGAN and UNSB as two representative backbones.
Comprehensive evaluation across three imaging modalities: optical coherence
tomography angiography, color fundus and X-ray coronary angiography
demonstrates that CST improves translation fidelity and achieves
state-of-the-art performance. By reinforcing geometric integrity in learned
mappings, CST establishes a principled pathway toward curvilinear
structure-aware cross-domain translation in medical imaging.

*Rashik Shadman,M G Sarwar Murshed,Faraz Hussain*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Ensemble-CAM的新技术，为基于深度学习的活体检测系统提供视觉解释，提高系统的透明度和可信度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的深度学习活体检测系统多为黑盒模型，决策过程不透明。需要解释性技术来理解模型判断生物特征图像真伪的依据。

Method: 开发了Ensemble-CAM技术，为基于深度学习的面部活体检测系统提供视觉解释，识别影响模型决策的关键区域。

Result: 该方法能够生成视觉解释，展示导致系统将生物特征图像判断为真实或伪造的关键区域。

Conclusion: Ensemble-CAM技术提高了深度学习活体检测系统的透明度和可信度，有助于用户理解模型行为。

Abstract: Presentation attacks represent a critical security threat where adversaries
use fake biometric data, such as face, fingerprint, or iris images, to gain
unauthorized access to protected systems. Various presentation attack detection
(PAD) systems have been designed leveraging deep learning (DL) models to
mitigate this type of threat. Despite their effectiveness, most of the DL
models function as black boxes - their decisions are opaque to their users. The
purpose of explainability techniques is to provide detailed information about
the reason behind the behavior or decision of DL models. In particular, visual
explanation is necessary to better understand the decisions or predictions of
DL-based PAD systems and determine the key regions due to which a biometric
image is considered real or fake by the system. In this work, a novel
technique, Ensemble-CAM, is proposed for providing visual explanations for the
decisions made by deep learning-based face PAD systems. Our goal is to improve
DL-based face PAD systems by providing a better understanding of their
behavior. Our provided visual explanations will enhance the transparency and
trustworthiness of DL-based face PAD systems.

*Kuai Yu,Crystal Su,Xiang Liu,Judah Goldfeder,Mingyuan Shao,Hod Lipson*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LyTimeT是一个两阶段框架，通过时空注意力机制和稳定性约束从高维视频中提取可解释的动态系统变量，有效抑制视觉干扰因素。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从高维视频中提取系统真实动态变量具有挑战性，因为存在背景运动、遮挡和纹理变化等干扰因素。需要开发能够学习稳健潜在表示的方法。

Method: 第一阶段使用时序变换器自编码器，通过全局注意力关注动态相关区域；第二阶段通过线性相关性分析选择物理意义维度，并使用李雅普诺夫稳定性正则化器优化转移动态。

Result: 在五个合成基准和四个真实世界动态系统上的实验表明，LyTimeT在互信息和内在维度估计上最接近真实值，对背景扰动具有不变性，在CNN和变换器基线中达到最低分析均方误差。

Conclusion: 结合时空注意力与稳定性约束可以产生既准确又物理可解释的预测模型。

Abstract: Extracting the true dynamical variables of a system from high-dimensional
video is challenging due to distracting visual factors such as background
motion, occlusions, and texture changes. We propose LyTimeT, a two-phase
framework for interpretable variable extraction that learns robust and stable
latent representations of dynamical systems. In Phase 1, LyTimeT employs a
spatio-temporal TimeSformer-based autoencoder that uses global attention to
focus on dynamically relevant regions while suppressing nuisance variation,
enabling distraction-robust latent state learning and accurate long-horizon
video prediction. In Phase 2, we probe the learned latent space, select the
most physically meaningful dimensions using linear correlation analysis, and
refine the transition dynamics with a Lyapunov-based stability regularizer to
enforce contraction and reduce error accumulation during roll-outs. Experiments
on five synthetic benchmarks and four real-world dynamical systems, including
chaotic phenomena, show that LyTimeT achieves mutual information and intrinsic
dimension estimates closest to ground truth, remains invariant under background
perturbations, and delivers the lowest analytical mean squared error among
CNN-based (TIDE) and transformer-only baselines. Our results demonstrate that
combining spatio-temporal attention with stability constraints yields
predictive models that are not only accurate but also physically interpretable.

TL;DR: 提出ADQ自适应分布感知量化框架，解决激活值高度非均匀分布和权重量化中静态不匹配码本问题，通过自适应权重量化方案和硬件友好的非均匀到均匀映射，在低比特量化下实现优异性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有量化感知训练方法面临两个主要挑战：激活值的高度非均匀分布特性，以及权重量化中使用的静态不匹配码本问题。

Method: 提出自适应分布感知量化(ADQ)框架，包含三个关键创新：1)基于分位数的码本初始化方法；2)基于指数移动平均的在线码本自适应机制；3)敏感度感知的混合精度分配策略。对于激活值，集成硬件友好的非均匀到均匀映射方案。

Result: 在ImageNet上，ADQ使ResNet-18在平均位宽仅2.81比特的情况下达到71.512%的Top-1准确率，在可比条件下优于最先进方法。在CIFAR-10上的消融研究系统验证了各创新组件的贡献。

Conclusion: ADQ通过自适应权重量化方案有效解决了深度神经网络量化中的分布不匹配问题，在低比特量化下实现了优异的性能表现。

Abstract: Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) is a critical technique for deploying deep
neural networks on resource-constrained devices. However, existing methods
often face two major challenges: the highly non-uniform distribution of
activations and the static, mismatched codebooks used in weight quantization.
To address these challenges, we propose Adaptive Distribution-aware
Quantization (ADQ), a mixed-precision quantization framework that employs a
differentiated strategy. The core of ADQ is a novel adaptive weight
quantization scheme comprising three key innovations: (1) a quantile-based
initialization method that constructs a codebook closely aligned with the
initial weight distribution; (2) an online codebook adaptation mechanism based
on Exponential Moving Average (EMA) to dynamically track distributional shifts;
and (3) a sensitivity-informed strategy for mixed-precision allocation. For
activations, we integrate a hardware-friendly non-uniform-to-uniform mapping
scheme. Comprehensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our method. On
ImageNet, ADQ enables a ResNet-18 to achieve 71.512% Top-1 accuracy with an
average bit-width of only 2.81 bits, outperforming state-of-the-art methods
under comparable conditions. Furthermore, detailed ablation studies on CIFAR-10
systematically demonstrate the individual contributions of each innovative
component, validating the rationale and effectiveness of our design.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OmniMotion-X是一个多功能多模态人体运动生成框架，采用自回归扩散变换器，支持文本到运动、音乐到舞蹈、语音到手势等多种任务，并构建了最大的统一多模态运动数据集OmniMoCap-X。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决多模态人体运动生成中内容一致性、风格保持和时间动态控制的问题，同时处理多模态任务间的冲突，需要开发一个统一且高效的框架。

Method: 提出使用参考运动作为条件信号，采用渐进式弱到强混合条件训练策略处理多模态冲突，构建了包含28个公开MoCap源的最大统一多模态运动数据集OmniMoCap-X，并使用GPT-4o自动生成结构化层次化标注。

Result: 实验评估表明，OmniMotion-X在多个多模态任务上显著优于现有方法，实现了最先进的性能，能够交互式生成真实、连贯且可控的长时长运动。

Conclusion: OmniMotion-X通过统一的序列到序列框架和创新的训练策略，在多模态人体运动生成任务中表现出色，为现实动画提供了高质量、一致且可控的运动生成能力。

Abstract: This paper introduces OmniMotion-X, a versatile multimodal framework for
whole-body human motion generation, leveraging an autoregressive diffusion
transformer in a unified sequence-to-sequence manner. OmniMotion-X efficiently
supports diverse multimodal tasks, including text-to-motion, music-to-dance,
speech-to-gesture, and global spatial-temporal control scenarios (e.g., motion
prediction, in-betweening, completion, and joint/trajectory-guided synthesis),
as well as flexible combinations of these tasks. Specifically, we propose the
use of reference motion as a novel conditioning signal, substantially enhancing
the consistency of generated content, style, and temporal dynamics crucial for
realistic animations. To handle multimodal conflicts, we introduce a
progressive weak-to-strong mixed-condition training strategy. To enable
high-quality multimodal training, we construct OmniMoCap-X, the largest unified
multimodal motion dataset to date, integrating 28 publicly available MoCap
sources across 10 distinct tasks, standardized to the SMPL-X format at 30 fps.
To ensure detailed and consistent annotations, we render sequences into videos
and use GPT-4o to automatically generate structured and hierarchical captions,
capturing both low-level actions and high-level semantics. Extensive
experimental evaluations confirm that OmniMotion-X significantly surpasses
existing methods, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance across multiple
multimodal tasks and enabling the interactive generation of realistic,
coherent, and controllable long-duration motions.

TL;DR: 提出了CPL-NC框架，通过类感知原型缓存和负对比学习机制，解决视觉语言模型在测试时适应中的原型退化和类间混淆问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型在分布偏移时性能下降，现有测试时适应方法忽视长尾分布中的原型退化和语义相似类间的混淆问题。

Method: 使用类感知原型缓存模块动态调整每类容量，结合负对比学习机制约束困难负样本，采用非对称优化仅更新文本原型。

Result: 在15个基准测试中，CPL-NC在ResNet-50和ViT-B/16骨干网络上均优于现有TTA方法。

Conclusion: CPL-NC是轻量级的测试时适应框架，能有效提升视觉语言模型在分布偏移下的泛化能力。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) demonstrate impressive zero-shot generalization
through large-scale image-text pretraining, yet their performance can drop once
the deployment distribution diverges from the training distribution. To address
this, Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) methods update models using unlabeled target
data. However, existing approaches often ignore two key challenges: prototype
degradation in long-tailed distributions and confusion between semantically
similar classes. To tackle these issues, we propose \textbf{C}lass-Aware
\textbf{P}rototype \textbf{L}earning with \textbf{N}egative
\textbf{C}ontrast(\textbf{CPL-NC}), a lightweight TTA framework designed
specifically for VLMs to enhance generalization under distribution shifts.
CPL-NC introduces a \textit{Class-Aware Prototype Cache} Module that
dynamically adjusts per-class capacity based on test-time frequency and
activation history, with a rejuvenation mechanism for inactive classes to
retain rare-category knowledge. Additionally, a \textit{Negative Contrastive
Learning} Mechanism identifies and constrains hard visual-textual negatives to
improve class separability. The framework employs asymmetric optimization,
refining only textual prototypes while anchoring on stable visual features.
Experiments on 15 benchmarks show that CPL-NC consistently outperforms prior
TTA methods across both ResNet-50 and ViT-B/16 backbones.

Motivation: 当前多模态模型在文本引导图像编辑方面取得显著进展，但研究社区缺乏基于真实图像的大规模、高质量、开放可访问的数据集。

Method: 利用Nano-Banana从OpenImages真实照片生成多样化编辑对，采用细粒度图像编辑分类法确保编辑类型全面覆盖，通过MLLM质量评分和精心筛选保持内容保留和指令忠实度。

Conclusion: Pico-Banana-400K为训练和基准测试下一代文本引导图像编辑模型提供了坚实基础。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal models have demonstrated remarkable text-guided
image editing capabilities, with systems like GPT-4o and Nano-Banana setting
new benchmarks. However, the research community's progress remains constrained
by the absence of large-scale, high-quality, and openly accessible datasets
built from real images. We introduce Pico-Banana-400K, a comprehensive
400K-image dataset for instruction-based image editing. Our dataset is
constructed by leveraging Nano-Banana to generate diverse edit pairs from real
photographs in the OpenImages collection. What distinguishes Pico-Banana-400K
from previous synthetic datasets is our systematic approach to quality and
diversity. We employ a fine-grained image editing taxonomy to ensure
comprehensive coverage of edit types while maintaining precise content
preservation and instruction faithfulness through MLLM-based quality scoring
and careful curation. Beyond single turn editing, Pico-Banana-400K enables
research into complex editing scenarios. The dataset includes three specialized
subsets: (1) a 72K-example multi-turn collection for studying sequential
editing, reasoning, and planning across consecutive modifications; (2) a
56K-example preference subset for alignment research and reward model training;
and (3) paired long-short editing instructions for developing instruction
rewriting and summarization capabilities. By providing this large-scale,
high-quality, and task-rich resource, Pico-Banana-400K establishes a robust
foundation for training and benchmarking the next generation of text-guided
image editing models.

Method: 对现有指标进行定量分析，测试它们对各种地面真值扰动的敏感性，并与人类判断进行比较；提出基于相对表面法线的新指标、新的深度可视化工具和创建更好人类对齐组合指标的原理方法。

Result: 分析显示现有指标对曲率扰动（如使平坦表面波浪化）严重不敏感；提出的新指标和组合方法能更好地与人类判断对齐。

Conclusion: 单目深度估计评估需要更敏感的指标，基于相对表面法线的新指标和组合指标方法能改善与人类判断的一致性，为标准化评估提供基础。

Abstract: Monocular depth estimation is an important task with rapid progress, but how
to evaluate it remains an open question, as evidenced by a lack of
standardization in existing literature and a large selection of evaluation
metrics whose trade-offs and behaviors are not well understood. This paper
contributes a novel, quantitative analysis of existing metrics in terms of
their sensitivity to various types of perturbations of ground truth,
emphasizing comparison to human judgment. Our analysis reveals that existing
metrics are severely under-sensitive to curvature perturbation such as making
flat surfaces wavy. To remedy this, we introduce a new metric based on relative
surface normals, along with new depth visualization tools and a principled
method to create composite metrics with better human alignment. Code and data

with separate models for entity recognition and disambiguation, which can be
computationally intensive and less effective. We propose a fine-tuned model
that jointly integrates entity recognition and disambiguation in a unified

Motivation: 大型语言模型在科学文献处理中存在信息偏见和计算成本高的问题，需要更精确、经济的信息检索方法。

Method: 构建了包含7700万高质量句子的地球科学语料库，使用MiniLMs通过语义搜索和句子级索引进行高效信息提取，并分析情感和主题聚类。

Conclusion: MiniLM在地球科学社区具有巨大潜力，可用于事实检索、趋势分析、矛盾分析和教育应用。

Abstract: Recent advancements in natural language processing, particularly with large
language models (LLMs), are transforming how scientists engage with the
literature. While the adoption of LLMs is increasing, concerns remain regarding
potential information biases and computational costs. Rather than LLMs, I
developed a framework to evaluate the feasibility of precise, rapid, and
cost-effective information retrieval from extensive geoscience literature using
freely available small language models (MiniLMs). A curated corpus of
approximately 77 million high-quality sentences, extracted from 95 leading
peer-reviewed geoscience journals such as Geophysical Research Letters and
Earth and Planetary Science Letters published during years 2000 to 2024, was
constructed. MiniLMs enable a computationally efficient approach for extracting
relevant domain-specific information from these corpora through semantic search
techniques and sentence-level indexing. This approach, unlike LLMs such as
ChatGPT-4 that often produces generalized responses, excels at identifying
substantial amounts of expert-verified information with established,
multi-disciplinary sources, especially for information with quantitative
findings. Furthermore, by analyzing emotional tone via sentiment analysis and
topical clusters through unsupervised clustering within sentences, MiniLM
provides a powerful tool for tracking the evolution of conclusions, research
priorities, advancements, and emerging questions within geoscience communities.
Overall, MiniLM holds significant potential within the geoscience community for
applications such as fact and image retrievals, trend analyses, contradiction
analyses, and educational purposes.

Conclusion: 这项工作提供了一个实用的评估工具，并对当代LLM的指令遵循能力进行了最全面的实证分析之一。

Abstract: Despite widespread deployment of Large Language Models, systematic evaluation
of instruction-following capabilities remains challenging. While comprehensive
benchmarks exist, focused assessments that quickly diagnose specific
instruction adherence patterns are valuable. As newer models may be trained on
existing benchmarks, novel evaluation approaches are needed to assess genuine
capabilities rather than memorized performance. This paper presents a
streamlined evaluation framework using twenty carefully designed prompts to
assess LLM instruction-following across diverse task categories. We demonstrate
this framework through a large-scale empirical study conducted on October 14,
2025, testing 256 verified working models from 331 available via OpenRouter. To
ensure methodological rigor and prevent selection bias, we first verified each
model's basic functionality before inclusion. Unlike large-scale benchmarks
requiring extensive computational resources, our approach offers a practical
diagnostic tool researchers and practitioners can readily apply. Our
methodology builds upon verifiable instructions while introducing a compact
test suite balancing comprehensiveness with efficiency. Each prompt targets
distinct aspects of instruction following, including format compliance, content
constraints, logical sequencing, and multi-step task execution. We evaluate
models from major providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Meta, Mistral) and
emerging implementations (Qwen, DeepSeek, community models), providing
comparative performance analysis. Our findings reveal consistent failure modes
and identify specific instruction types posing particular challenges. This work
contributes both a practical evaluation tool and one of the most comprehensive
empirical analyses of instruction-following capabilities across the
contemporary LLM landscape.

Motivation: 虽然机器翻译在高资源语言上取得了显著进展，但低资源语言如锡尔赫特语仍然研究不足，需要为这些被忽视的语言开发包容性语言技术。

Method: 通过微调多语言Transformer模型（如mBART-50和MarianMT），并与零样本大语言模型进行比较研究。

Result: 微调模型显著优于大语言模型，mBART-50在翻译充分性方面表现最佳，MarianMT在字符级保真度方面最强。

Abstract: Machine Translation (MT) has advanced from rule-based and statistical methods
to neural approaches based on the Transformer architecture. While these methods
have achieved impressive results for high-resource languages, low-resource
varieties such as Sylheti remain underexplored. In this work, we investigate
Bengali-to-Sylheti translation by fine-tuning multilingual Transformer models
and comparing them with zero-shot large language models (LLMs). Experimental
results demonstrate that fine-tuned models significantly outperform LLMs, with
mBART-50 achieving the highest translation adequacy and MarianMT showing the
strongest character-level fidelity. These findings highlight the importance of
task-specific adaptation for underrepresented languages and contribute to
ongoing efforts toward inclusive language technologies.

GPTZero, either incur high computational cost or lack sufficient accuracy,
often with a trade-off between the two, leaving room for further improvement.
To address these gaps, we propose the fine-tuning of encoder-only Small
Language Models (SLMs), in particular, the pre-trained models of RoBERTA and
CodeBERTa using specialized datasets on source code and other natural language
to prove that for the task of binary classification, SLMs outperform LLMs by a
huge margin whilst using a fraction of compute. Our encoders achieve AUROC $=
0.97$ to $0.99$ and macro-F1 $0.89$ to $0.94$ while reducing latency by
$8$-$12\times$ and peak VRAM by $3$-$5\times$ at $512$-token inputs. Under
cross-generator shifts and adversarial transformations (paraphrase,
back-translation; code formatting/renaming), performance retains $\geq 92%$ of
clean AUROC. We release training and evaluation scripts with seeds and configs;
a reproducibility checklist is also included.

### [81] [Improving Topic Modeling of Social Media Short Texts with Rephrasing: A Case Study of COVID-19 Related Tweets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18908)
*Wangjiaxuan Xin,Shuhua Yin,Shi Chen,Yaorong Ge*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TM-Rephrase是一个模型无关的框架，利用大语言模型将原始推文重新表述为更标准化和正式的语言，以改进社交媒体短文本的主题建模效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体短文本（如推文）的简洁性、非正式性和噪声往往阻碍传统主题建模的有效性，产生难以解释的不连贯或冗余主题。

Method: 开发TM-Rephrase框架，使用LLMs对原始推文进行重新表述，研究两种重新表述策略（通用和口语到正式）对多种主题建模方法的影响，使用25,027条COVID-19相关推文数据集。

Result: TM-Rephrase提高了主题建模性能的三个指标（主题连贯性、主题独特性和主题多样性），同时减少了大多数主题建模算法的主题冗余，其中口语到正式策略对LDA算法的性能提升最大。

Conclusion: 该研究为公共卫生相关社交媒体分析中的主题建模提供了一种模型无关的增强方法，对改善健康危机及其他重要领域中公共话语的理解具有广泛意义。

Abstract: Social media platforms such as Twitter (now X) provide rich data for
analyzing public discourse, especially during crises such as the COVID-19
pandemic. However, the brevity, informality, and noise of social media short
texts often hinder the effectiveness of traditional topic modeling, producing
incoherent or redundant topics that are often difficult to interpret. To
address these challenges, we have developed \emph{TM-Rephrase}, a
model-agnostic framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to
rephrase raw tweets into more standardized and formal language prior to topic
modeling. Using a dataset of 25,027 COVID-19-related Twitter posts, we
investigate the effects of two rephrasing strategies, general- and
colloquial-to-formal-rephrasing, on multiple topic modeling methods. Results
demonstrate that \emph{TM-Rephrase} improves three metrics measuring topic
modeling performance (i.e., topic coherence, topic uniqueness, and topic
diversity) while reducing topic redundancy of most topic modeling algorithms,
with the colloquial-to-formal strategy yielding the greatest performance gains
and especially for the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) algorithm. This study
contributes to a model-agnostic approach to enhancing topic modeling in public
health related social media analysis, with broad implications for improved
understanding of public discourse in health crisis as well as other important
domains.

TL;DR: 提出ODiS算法，通过主成分分析将多维度评分去相关，构建正交特征维度来选择预训练数据，确保质量和多样性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于评分的数据选择方法会压缩相关维度，导致只关注质量而忽视多样性，造成下游任务性能下降

Method: 1. 多维度评估数据质量；2. 用PCA去相关得到正交维度；3. 训练Roberta评分器进行大规模推理；4. 在每个正交维度选择高分数据

Result: ODiS选择的数据维度间重叠度小于2%，在多个下游基准测试中显著优于基线方法

Conclusion: 正交、多样性感知的数据选择对LLM预训练至关重要，ODiS算法能有效平衡数据质量和多样性

Abstract: High-quality pre-training data is crutial for large language models, where
quality captures factual reliability and semantic value, and diversity ensures
broad coverage and distributional heterogeneity. Existing approaches typically
rely on single or multiple-dimensional score-based selection. However, directly
selecting top-scored data often degrades performance, and sampling from a
broader range is required to recover results. The above non-monotonicity
between dataset scores and downstream benchmark results reveals a fundamental
bias: score-based methods collapse correlated dimensions, causing top-scored
data to appear high-quality while systematically overlooking diversity. We
argue that ensuring diversity requires decomposing correlated metrics into
orthogonal feature dimensions, from which the top-scored data can be directly
selected. Therefore, we proposed the Orthogonal Diversity-Aware Selection
(ODiS) algorithm, which preserves both quality and diversity during data
selection. First, ODiS evaluates data from multiple dimensions, covering
language quality, knowledge quality, and comprehension difficulty. The
multi-dimensional scores are then decorrelated via Principal Component Analysis
(PCA), yielding orthogonal evaluation dimensions. For each dimension, a
Roberta-based scorer is trained to regress the data onto PCA-projected scores,
enabling scalable inference on large corpora. Finally, ODiS constructs the
training dataset by selecting top-scored data within each orthogonal dimension,
thereby ensuring both quality and diversity. Empirical results show that
ODiS-selected data exhibit less than 2\% inter-dimension overlap, confirming
orthogonality between dimensions. More importantly, models trained with
ODiS-selected data significantly outperform other baselines on downstream
benchmarks, highlighting the necessity of orthogonal, diversity-aware data
selection for LLMs.

answering). Seven of the datasets in MLEB were newly constructed in order to
fill domain and jurisdictional gaps in the open-source legal information
retrieval landscape. We document our methodology in building MLEB and creating
the new constituent datasets, and release our code, results, and data openly to
assist with reproducible evaluations.

TL;DR: 提出了一种动态可逆的剪枝框架，通过检测上下文感知的神经元激活并应用自适应掩码来调节生成过程中的影响，实现推理时的细粒度公平性控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型内部表示中存在不良行为，影响公平性、一致性，放大有害内容。现有方法计算成本高、不可逆且难以适应新对话上下文。

Method: 动态可逆剪枝框架，检测上下文感知神经元激活，应用自适应掩码调节生成影响，实现推理时细粒度控制。

Result: 在多语言单轮和多轮对话中保持知识完整性，实现更连贯的行为，支持动态公平性控制。

Conclusion: 该推理时解决方案为现实对话AI提供了灵活、透明的动态公平性控制方法。

Abstract: Large language models often display undesirable behaviors embedded in their
internal representations, undermining fairness, inconsistency drift,
amplification of harmful content, and the propagation of unwanted patterns
during extended dialogue and conversations. Although training-time or
data-centric methods attempt to reduce these effects, they are computationally
expensive, irreversible once deployed, and slow to adapt to new conversational
contexts. Pruning-based methods provide a flexible and transparent way to
reduce bias by adjusting the neurons responsible for certain behaviors.
However, most existing approaches are static; once a neuron is removed, the
model loses the ability to adapt when the conversation or context changes. To
address this, we propose a dynamic, reversible, pruning-based framework that
detects context-aware neuron activations and applies adaptive masking to
modulate their influence during generation. Our inference-time solution
provides fine-grained, memory-aware mitigation with knowledge-preserved, more
coherent behavior across multilingual single- and multi-turn dialogues,
enabling dynamic fairness control in real-world conversational AI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型正在从单模态理解向视觉、音频和语言模态的统一发展，但单模态与全模态之间的相关性尚不清楚，需要全面评估来推动全模态模型的智能演进。

Method: 构建了包含1880个人工标注样本的基准测试，涵盖44种任务类型，并引入了创新的多步骤开放式问题类型来更好地评估复杂推理任务。

Result: 实验结果显示跨模态和单模态性能之间存在组合规律，全模态能力在弱模型上表现为瓶颈效应，而在强模型上表现出协同促进作用。

Conclusion: MMAO-Bench基准测试能够有效评估单模态和全模态理解能力，揭示了全模态能力在不同模型强度下的不同表现模式。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Languages models have been progressing from uni-modal
understanding toward unifying visual, audio and language modalities,
collectively termed omni models. However, the correlation between uni-modal and
omni-modal remains unclear, which requires comprehensive evaluation to drive
omni model's intelligence evolution. In this work, we propose a novel, high
quality and diversity omni model benchmark, MultiModal All in One Benchmark
(MMAO-Bench), which effectively assesses both uni-modal and omni-modal
understanding capabilities. The benchmark consists of 1880 human curated
samples, across 44 task types, and a innovative multi-step open-ended question
type that better assess complex reasoning tasks. Experimental result shows the
compositional law between cross-modal and uni-modal performance and the
omni-modal capability manifests as a bottleneck effect on weak models, while
exhibiting synergistic promotion on strong models.

TL;DR: ToolDreamer是一个框架，通过使用LLM生成假设性的工具描述来改进工具检索，使检索器能更好地理解用户查询与工具之间的语义对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有检索模型基于用户查询与工具描述的相似性进行排名，但由于用户请求与工具描述语言不匹配，导致检索效果不佳。需要一种方法使检索器能更好地理解查询意图。

Method: 提出ToolDreamer框架，使用LLM生成假设性的工具描述，这些描述是LLM认为可能对查询有用的工具描述，从而在工具描述的语言空间内实现更自然的对齐。

Result: 在ToolRet数据集上的实验表明，该方法提高了稀疏和密集检索器的性能，无论是否经过训练，展示了其灵活性。

Conclusion: 该框架将部分推理负担转移到检索器上，使LLM能够有效处理大量工具而不会超出上下文窗口限制。

Abstract: Tool calling has become increasingly popular for Large Language Models
(LLMs). However, for large tool sets, the resulting tokens would exceed the
LLM's context window limit, making it impossible to include every tool. Hence,
an external retriever is used to provide LLMs with the most relevant tools for
a query. Existing retrieval models rank tools based on the similarity between a
user query and a tool description (TD). This leads to suboptimal retrieval as
user requests are often poorly aligned with the language of TD. To remedy the
issue, we propose ToolDreamer, a framework to condition retriever models to
fetch tools based on hypothetical (synthetic) TD generated using an LLM, i.e.,
description of tools that the LLM feels will be potentially useful for the
query. The framework enables a more natural alignment between queries and tools
within the language space of TD's. We apply ToolDreamer on the ToolRet dataset
and show that our method improves the performance of sparse and dense
retrievers with and without training, thus showcasing its flexibility. Through
our proposed framework, our aim is to offload a portion of the reasoning burden
to the retriever so that the LLM may effectively handle a large collection of
tools without inundating its context window.

TL;DR: 提出基于Transformer预训练语言模型的可解释性虚假信息检测管道，使用两阶段微调策略优化RoBERTa和DistilBERT，在保持性能的同时显著降低计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线平台虚假信息快速传播破坏信任并阻碍明智决策，需要开发高效且可解释的检测方法。

Method: 采用两阶段微调策略：先冻结主干网络训练分类头，然后逐步解冻主干层并应用分层学习率衰减；集成LIME和SHAP提供局部和全局解释。

Result: 在COVID Fake News和FakeNewsNet GossipCop数据集上，DistilBERT达到与RoBERTa相当的准确率，同时显著减少计算资源需求。

Conclusion: 预训练语言模型结合原则性微调和可解释性方法，可为可扩展、可信赖的虚假信息检测提供有效框架。

Abstract: The rapid spread of misinformation on online platforms undermines trust among
individuals and hinders informed decision making. This paper shows an
explainable and computationally efficient pipeline to detect misinformation
using transformer-based pretrained language models (PLMs). We optimize both
RoBERTa and DistilBERT using a two-step strategy: first, we freeze the backbone
and train only the classification head; then, we progressively unfreeze the
backbone layers while applying layer-wise learning rate decay. On two
real-world benchmark datasets, COVID Fake News and FakeNewsNet GossipCop, we
test the proposed approach with a unified protocol of preprocessing and
stratified splits. To ensure transparency, we integrate the Local Interpretable
Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) at the token level to present token-level
rationales and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) at the global feature
attribution level. It demonstrates that DistilBERT achieves accuracy comparable
to RoBERTa while requiring significantly less computational resources. This
work makes two key contributions: (1) it quantitatively shows that a
lightweight PLM can maintain task performance while substantially reducing
computational cost, and (2) it presents an explainable pipeline that retrieves
faithful local and global justifications without compromising performance. The
results suggest that PLMs combined with principled fine-tuning and
interpretability can be an effective framework for scalable, trustworthy
misinformation detection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估大型语言模型在复杂任务中的创造力通常需要难以扩展的人工评估，需要开发可扩展的评估方法。

Method: 通过分析叙事中的符号化角色网络（带符号边权重的网络），比较四个主流LLM和人类写作语料库生成的1200多个故事的网络特性。

Result: LLM生成的故事在网络密度、聚类系数和符号边权重等网络属性上表现出对紧密、积极关系的强烈偏好，这与先前人工评估的研究结果一致。

Conclusion: 该方法为评估当前和未来LLM在创意故事讲述中的局限性和倾向提供了有价值的工具。

Abstract: Evaluating the creative capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in
complex tasks often requires human assessments that are difficult to scale. We
introduce a novel, scalable methodology for evaluating LLM story generation by
analyzing underlying social structures in narratives as signed character
networks. To demonstrate its effectiveness, we conduct a large-scale
comparative analysis using networks from over 1,200 stories, generated by four
leading LLMs (GPT-4o, GPT-4o mini, Gemini 1.5 Pro, and Gemini 1.5 Flash) and a
human-written corpus. Our findings, based on network properties like density,
clustering, and signed edge weights, show that LLM-generated stories
consistently exhibit a strong bias toward tightly-knit, positive relationships,
which aligns with findings from prior research using human assessment. Our
proposed approach provides a valuable tool for evaluating limitations and
tendencies in the creative storytelling of current and future LLMs.

TL;DR: SLIM框架通过分离搜索和浏览工具、定期总结轨迹来解决长轨迹代理搜索中的上下文限制问题，在保持性能的同时显著降低成本和工具调用次数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有代理搜索框架在长轨迹任务中面临上下文限制问题，包括积累冗长噪声内容、超出上下文窗口和工具预算、过早停止等，难以扩展到长轨迹搜索。

Method: 提出SLIM框架，将检索分离为独立的搜索和浏览工具，并定期总结轨迹以保持上下文简洁，实现更长、更专注的搜索。

Result: 在长轨迹任务上，SLIM以显著更低的成本和更少的工具调用达到可比性能。使用o3基础模型时，在BrowseComp和HLE上分别达到56%和31%，优于所有开源框架，同时工具调用减少4-6倍。

Conclusion: SLIM框架有效解决了长轨迹代理搜索的上下文限制问题，减少了幻觉，为未来长轨迹代理设计提供了分析框架和简单工具设计参考。

Abstract: Long-horizon agentic search requires iteratively exploring the web over long
trajectories and synthesizing information across many sources, and is the
foundation for enabling powerful applications like deep research systems. In
this work, we show that popular agentic search frameworks struggle to scale to
long trajectories primarily due to context limitations-they accumulate long,
noisy content, hit context window and tool budgets, or stop early. Then, we
introduce SLIM (Simple Lightweight Information Management), a simple framework
that separates retrieval into distinct search and browse tools, and
periodically summarizes the trajectory, keeping context concise while enabling
longer, more focused searches. On long-horizon tasks, SLIM achieves comparable
performance at substantially lower cost and with far fewer tool calls than
strong open-source baselines across multiple base models. Specifically, with o3
as the base model, SLIM achieves 56% on BrowseComp and 31% on HLE,
outperforming all open-source frameworks by 8 and 4 absolute points,
respectively, while incurring 4-6x fewer tool calls. Finally, we release an
automated fine-grained trajectory analysis pipeline and error taxonomy for
characterizing long-horizon agentic search frameworks; SLIM exhibits fewer
hallucinations than prior systems. We hope our analysis framework and simple
tool design inform future long-horizon agents.

Conclusion: ProfBench为专业领域任务评估提供了公平可访问的基准，揭示了扩展思维在处理复杂专业任务中的重要作用。

Abstract: Evaluating progress in large language models (LLMs) is often constrained by
the challenge of verifying responses, limiting assessments to tasks like
mathematics, programming, and short-form question-answering. However, many
real-world applications require evaluating LLMs in processing professional
documents, synthesizing information, and generating comprehensive reports in
response to user queries. We introduce ProfBench: a set of over 7000
response-criterion pairs as evaluated by human-experts with professional
knowledge across Physics PhD, Chemistry PhD, Finance MBA and Consulting MBA. We
build robust and affordable LLM-Judges to evaluate ProfBench rubrics, by
mitigating self-enhancement bias and reducing the cost of evaluation by 2-3
orders of magnitude, to make it fair and accessible to the broader community.
Our findings reveal that ProfBench poses significant challenges even for
state-of-the-art LLMs, with top-performing models like GPT-5-high achieving

TL;DR: 开发了一个动态生成模型特定挑战数据集的框架，构建了OVERBENCH基准，包含45万个样本，用于持续监测语言模型的过度敏感性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决语言模型对无害内容的防御性拒绝问题，以及静态数据集因模型演化而退化的局限性。

Method: 开发动态生成模型特定挑战数据集的框架，构建OVERBENCH基准，聚合来自25个模型的45万个样本。

Result: OVERBENCH提供了动态演化的视角来监测过度敏感性，能够捕捉静态数据集忽略的漏洞。

Conclusion: 该框架能够持续监测模型防御性触发模式，为评估语言模型过度敏感性提供了更有效的工具。

Abstract: Oversensitivity occurs when language models defensively reject prompts that
are actually benign. This behavior not only disrupts user interactions but also
obscures the boundary between harmful and harmless content. Existing benchmarks
rely on static datasets that degrade overtime as models evolve, leading to data
contamination and diminished evaluative power. To address this, we develop a
framework that dynamically generates model-specific challenging datasets,
capturing emerging defensive patterns and aligning with each model's unique
behavior. Building on this approach, we construct OVERBENCH, a benchmark that
aggregates these datasets across diverse LLM families, encompassing 450,000
samples from 25 models. OVERBENCH provides a dynamic and evolving perspective
on oversensitivity, allowing for continuous monitoring of defensive triggers as
models advance, highlighting vulnerabilities that static datasets overlook.

Motivation: 随着LLM在人类-AI交互中的广泛应用，其在人际语境中的社会推理能力变得至关重要。

Method: 引入SCRIPTS数据集，包含1k个英韩双语电影剧本对话，由母语者标注概率性关系标签，评估9个模型的关系推断能力。

Result: 专有LLM在英语数据集上达到75-80%准确率，但在韩语上降至58-69%；10-25%的响应选择了不可能关系；思维模型和思维链提示对社会推理帮助有限且可能放大社会偏见。

Conclusion: 当前LLM的社会推理能力存在显著局限，需要开发更具社会意识的语言模型。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in human-AI
interactions, their social reasoning capabilities in interpersonal contexts are
critical. We introduce SCRIPTS, a 1k-dialogue dataset in English and Korean,
sourced from movie scripts. The task involves evaluating models' social
reasoning capability to infer the interpersonal relationships (e.g., friends,
sisters, lovers) between speakers in each dialogue. Each dialogue is annotated
with probabilistic relational labels (Highly Likely, Less Likely, Unlikely) by
native (or equivalent) Korean and English speakers from Korea and the U.S.
Evaluating nine models on our task, current proprietary LLMs achieve around
75-80% on the English dataset, whereas their performance on Korean drops to
58-69%. More strikingly, models select Unlikely relationships in 10-25% of
their responses. Furthermore, we find that thinking models and chain-of-thought
prompting, effective for general reasoning, provide minimal benefits for social
reasoning and occasionally amplify social biases. Our findings reveal
significant limitations in current LLMs' social reasoning capabilities,
highlighting the need for efforts to develop socially-aware language models.

Abstract: Evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) for mental health support is
challenging due to the emotionally and cognitively complex nature of
therapeutic dialogue. Existing benchmarks are limited in scale, reliability,
often relying on synthetic or social media data, and lack frameworks to assess
when automated judges can be trusted. To address the need for large-scale
dialogue datasets and judge reliability assessment, we introduce two benchmarks
that provide a framework for generation and evaluation. MentalBench-100k
consolidates 10,000 one-turn conversations from three real scenarios datasets,
each paired with nine LLM-generated responses, yielding 100,000 response pairs.
MentalAlign-70k}reframes evaluation by comparing four high-performing LLM
judges with human experts across 70,000 ratings on seven attributes, grouped
into Cognitive Support Score (CSS) and Affective Resonance Score (ARS). We then
employ the Affective Cognitive Agreement Framework, a statistical methodology
using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) with confidence intervals to
quantify agreement, consistency, and bias between LLM judges and human experts.
Our analysis reveals systematic inflation by LLM judges, strong reliability for
cognitive attributes such as guidance and informativeness, reduced precision
for empathy, and some unreliability in safety and relevance. Our contributions

### [95] [From Memorization to Generalization: Fine-Tuning Large Language Models for Biomedical Term-to-Identifier Normalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19036)
*Suswitha Pericharla,Daniel B. Hier,Tayo Obafemi-Ajayi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 评估大型语言模型在生物医学术语标准化任务中的表现，发现微调效果取决于标识符的流行度和词汇化程度。流行标识符增强记忆能力，词汇化标识符支持语义泛化，而任意标识符限制模型只能死记硬背。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生物医学数据集成依赖于术语标准化，即将自然语言术语映射到标准化标识符。大型语言模型在此任务中表现不一，需要系统评估其在不同生物医学本体上的记忆和泛化能力。

Method: 使用Llama 3.1 8B模型在多个生物医学本体上进行微调，评估记忆能力（训练术语性能）和泛化能力（验证术语性能），并进行嵌入分析。

Result: GO映射显示强记忆增益（术语到标识符准确率提升77%），HPO改进最小。只有基因-蛋白质映射实现了泛化（13.9%增益）。GPT-4o在所有术语上都优于Llama变体。嵌入分析显示基因符号和蛋白质名称语义对齐紧密，但GO和HPO的术语与标识符对齐较弱。

Conclusion: 微调成功取决于标识符流行度和词汇化程度。流行标识符增强记忆，词汇化标识符支持语义泛化，而任意标识符限制模型只能死记硬背。这些发现为预测微调何时增强事实回忆、何时因稀疏或非词汇化标识符而失败提供了框架。

Abstract: Effective biomedical data integration depends on automated term
normalization, the mapping of natural language biomedical terms to standardized
identifiers. This linking of terms to identifiers is essential for semantic
interoperability. Large language models (LLMs) show promise for this task but
perform unevenly across terminologies. We evaluated both memorization
(training-term performance) and generalization (validation-term performance)
across multiple biomedical ontologies. Fine-tuning Llama 3.1 8B revealed marked
differences by terminology. GO mappings showed strong memorization gains (up to
77% improvement in term-to-identifier accuracy), whereas HPO showed minimal
improvement. Generalization occurred only for protein-gene (GENE) mappings
(13.9% gain), while fine-tuning for HPO and GO yielded negligible transfer.
Baseline accuracy varied by model scale, with GPT-4o outperforming both Llama
variants for all terminologies. Embedding analyses showed tight semantic
alignment between gene symbols and protein names but weak alignment between
terms and identifiers for GO or HPO, consistent with limited lexicalization.
Fine-tuning success depended on two interacting factors: identifier popularity
and lexicalization. Popular identifiers were more likely encountered during
pretraining, enhancing memorization. Lexicalized identifiers, such as gene
symbols, enabled semantic generalization. By contrast, arbitrary identifiers in
GO and HPO constrained models to rote learning. These findings provide a
predictive framework for when fine-tuning enhances factual recall versus when
it fails due to sparse or non-lexicalized identifiers.

Motivation: 扩展知识冲突研究到代码生成领域，探索LLMs如何处理参数知识与提示信息之间的不一致。

Method: 提出领域无关的知识冲突构建框架，开发专门针对代码冲突的评估方法和数据集，使用激活级引导技术。

Result: 大型LLMs能在参数中编码知识冲突概念，检测准确率达80.65%；激活引导比随机基线提升12.6%的引导成功率。

Conclusion: 模型大小、任务领域和引导方向的平衡对知识冲突处理效果至关重要，代码和数据将在接受后公开。

Abstract: This paper investigates how large language models (LLMs) behave when faced
with discrepancies between their parametric knowledge and conflicting
information contained in a prompt. Building on prior question-answering (QA)
research, we extend the investigation of knowledge conflicts to the realm of
code generation. We propose a domain-agnostic framework for constructing and
interpreting such conflicts, along with a novel evaluation method and dataset
tailored to code conflict scenarios. Our experiments indicate that sufficiently
large LLMs encode the notion of a knowledge conflict in their parameters,
enabling us to detect knowledge conflicts with up to \textbf{80.65\%} accuracy.
Building on these insights, we show that activation-level steering can achieve
up to a \textbf{12.6\%} improvement in steering success over a random baseline.
However, effectiveness depends critically on balancing model size, task domain,
and steering direction. The experiment code and data will be made publicly
available after acceptance.

*Valentin Noël*

TL;DR: 提出基于谱分析的框架，将transformer层建模为注意力诱导的动态图，通过图信号处理定义诊断指标，用于区分事实推理和幻觉。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型虽然表现出色，但难以区分事实推理和幻觉，需要开发有效的检测方法。

Method: 将transformer层建模为动态图，使用图信号处理定义Dirichlet能量、谱熵和高频能量比等诊断指标。

Result: 实验发现事实陈述呈现一致的"能量山"行为，而不同类型幻觉显示独特特征，基于谱特征的检测器达到88.75%准确率。

Conclusion: 谱几何能够捕捉推理模式和错误行为，为大型语言模型的幻觉检测提供了有前景的框架。

Abstract: Large language models achieve impressive results but distinguishing factual
reasoning from hallucinations remains challenging. We propose a spectral
analysis framework that models transformer layers as dynamic graphs induced by
attention, with token embeddings as signals on these graphs. Through graph
signal processing, we define diagnostics including Dirichlet energy, spectral
entropy, and high-frequency energy ratios, with theoretical connections to
computational stability. Experiments across GPT architectures suggest universal
spectral patterns: factual statements exhibit consistent "energy mountain"
behavior with low-frequency convergence, while different hallucination types
show distinct signatures. Logical contradictions destabilize spectra with large
effect sizes ($g>1.0$), semantic errors remain stable but show connectivity
drift, and substitution hallucinations display intermediate perturbations. A
simple detector using spectral signatures achieves 88.75% accuracy versus 75%
for perplexity-based baselines, demonstrating practical utility. These findings
indicate that spectral geometry may capture reasoning patterns and error
behaviors, potentially offering a framework for hallucination detection in
large language models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是探索不同Transformer架构如何通过不同的连接模式实现相同的语言计算，并检测这些架构特有的计算指纹。

Method: 使用图信号处理技术，在注意力诱导的token图上分析代数连通性（Fiedler值）的变化，特别是在语音交替任务中，分析20种语言和三个模型家族在早期层（2-5层）的表现。

Result: 发现Phi-3-Mini在英语中表现出显著的早期层中断，而其他19种语言影响最小；Qwen2.5-7B在形态丰富的语言中显示小幅度变化；LLaMA-3.2-1B表现出系统但较弱的响应。这些谱特征与行为差异强相关。

Conclusion: 训练重点会在计算中留下可检测的印记，表现为在句法转换期间可测量的连接模式。该框架可作为简单、无需训练的诊断工具，用于揭示架构偏见和支持模型可靠性分析。

Abstract: Different transformer architectures implement identical linguistic
computations via distinct connectivity patterns, yielding model imprinted
``computational fingerprints'' detectable through spectral analysis. Using
graph signal processing on attention induced token graphs, we track changes in
algebraic connectivity (Fiedler value, $\Delta\lambda_2$) under voice
alternation across 20 languages and three model families, with a prespecified
early window (layers 2--5). Our analysis uncovers clear architectural
signatures: Phi-3-Mini shows a dramatic English specific early layer disruption
($\overline{\Delta\lambda_2}_{[2,5]}\!\approx\!-0.446$) while effects in 19
other languages are minimal, consistent with public documentation that
positions the model primarily for English use. Qwen2.5-7B displays small,
distributed shifts that are largest for morphologically rich languages, and
LLaMA-3.2-1B exhibits systematic but muted responses. These spectral signatures
correlate strongly with behavioral differences (Phi-3: $r=-0.976$) and are
modulated by targeted attention head ablations, linking the effect to early
attention structure and confirming functional relevance. Taken together, the
findings are consistent with the view that training emphasis can leave
detectable computational imprints: specialized processing strategies that
manifest as measurable connectivity patterns during syntactic transformations.
Beyond voice alternation, the framework differentiates reasoning modes,
indicating utility as a simple, training free diagnostic for revealing
architectural biases and supporting model reliability analysis.

Conclusion: 本文旨在为未来藏语AI研究提供基础参考，鼓励通过跨语言迁移、多模态学习和社区驱动的资源创建来构建包容和可持续的低资源语言AI生态系统。

Abstract: Tibetan, one of the major low-resource languages in Asia, presents unique
linguistic and sociocultural characteristics that pose both challenges and
opportunities for AI research. Despite increasing interest in developing AI
systems for underrepresented languages, Tibetan has received limited attention
due to a lack of accessible data resources, standardized benchmarks, and
dedicated tools. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of the current
state of Tibetan AI in the AI domain, covering textual and speech data
resources, NLP tasks, machine translation, speech recognition, and recent
developments in LLMs. We systematically categorize existing datasets and tools,
evaluate methods used across different tasks, and compare performance where
possible. We also identify persistent bottlenecks such as data sparsity,
orthographic variation, and the lack of unified evaluation metrics.
Additionally, we discuss the potential of cross-lingual transfer, multi-modal
learning, and community-driven resource creation. This survey aims to serve as
a foundational reference for future work on Tibetan AI research and encourages
collaborative efforts to build an inclusive and sustainable AI ecosystem for
low-resource languages.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI技术发展，科技公司需要大量软件工程师，采用多阶段筛选流程。鉴于LLMs在编码和推理任务中的出色表现，研究其是否能通过专业招聘评估。

Method: 使用最先进的LLMs对广泛使用的专业评估问卷生成回答，并与公司参考解决方案进行对比评估。

Result: 分析显示模型生成的答案与公司参考解决方案之间存在显著不一致，所有评估的LLMs都未能通过招聘评估。

Conclusion: 尽管LLMs在编码和推理任务中表现出色，但无法通过实际的科技公司招聘评估，表明当前LLMs与实际工程师需求存在差距。

Abstract: With the proliferation of the internet and the rapid advancement of
Artificial Intelligence, leading technology companies face an urgent annual
demand for a considerable number of software and algorithm engineers. To
efficiently and effectively identify high-potential candidates from thousands
of applicants, these firms have established a multi-stage selection process,
which crucially includes a standardized hiring evaluation designed to assess
job-specific competencies. Motivated by the demonstrated prowess of Large
Language Models (LLMs) in coding and reasoning tasks, this paper investigates a
critical question: Can LLMs successfully pass these hiring evaluations? To this
end, we conduct a comprehensive examination of a widely used professional
assessment questionnaire. We employ state-of-the-art LLMs to generate responses
and subsequently evaluate their performance. Contrary to any prior expectation
of LLMs being ideal engineers, our analysis reveals a significant inconsistency
between the model-generated answers and the company-referenced solutions. Our
empirical findings lead to a striking conclusion: All evaluated LLMs fails to
pass the hiring evaluation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多跳检索增强生成方法效率低下，存在重复生成可预测令牌序列和随机停止的问题，导致令牌使用过多和终止不稳定。

Method: TSSS采用模板化推理缓存重复前缀并将子查询锚定到主问题，同时使用基于检索器的终止器在子查询重复时确定性地停止推理。

Result: 在HotpotQA、2WikiMultiHop和MuSiQue数据集上，TSSS在RAG-CoT方法中实现了最先进的准确率和有竞争力的效率。

Conclusion: TSSS通过分离结构化推理和终止控制，在效率受限场景（如设备端推理）中实现了更快的推理和更可靠的答案。

Abstract: Multi-hop retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a promising strategy for
complex reasoning, yet existing iterative prompting approaches remain
inefficient. They often regenerate predictable token sequences at every step
and rely on stochastic stopping, leading to excessive token usage and unstable
termination. We propose TSSS (Think Straight, Stop Smart), a structured
multi-hop RAG framework designed for efficiency. TSSS introduces (i) a
template-based reasoning that caches recurring prefixes and anchors sub-queries
to the main question, reducing token generation cost while promoting stable
reasoning, and (ii) a retriever-based terminator, which deterministically halts
reasoning once additional sub-queries collapse into repetition. This separation
of structured reasoning and termination control enables both faster inference
and more reliable answers. On HotpotQA, 2WikiMultiHop, and MuSiQue, TSSS
achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and competitive efficiency among RAG-CoT
approaches, highlighting its effectiveness in efficiency-constrained scenarios
such as on-device inference.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究使用结构化知识库评估LLM的时序知识冲突，但存在覆盖实体有限、缺乏动态结构等问题，无法公平评估不同知识截止日期的LLM。

Method: 从3个真实时间戳语料库中识别自然发生的知识演化，生成针对不同LLM知识截止日期的黄金答案问题，采用3种知识探测格式评估12个开源和闭源LLM。

Result: 在evolveQA基准上，LLM相比静态知识问题性能下降高达31%，显示LLM在处理时序演化知识方面存在显著困难。

Conclusion: evolveQA基准有效揭示了LLM在处理时序知识冲突时的性能缺陷，为评估LLM的时序知识处理能力提供了更公平的框架。

Abstract: LLMs often fail to handle temporal knowledge conflicts--contradictions
arising when facts evolve over time within their training data. Existing
studies evaluate this phenomenon through benchmarks built on structured
knowledge bases like Wikidata, but they focus on widely-covered,
easily-memorized popular entities and lack the dynamic structure needed to
fairly evaluate LLMs with different knowledge cut-off dates. We introduce
evolveQA, a benchmark specifically designed to evaluate LLMs on temporally
evolving knowledge, constructed from 3 real-world, time-stamped corpora: AWS
updates, Azure changes, and WHO disease outbreak reports. Our framework
identifies naturally occurring knowledge evolution and generates questions with
gold answers tailored to different LLM knowledge cut-off dates. Through
extensive evaluation of 12 open and closed-source LLMs across 3 knowledge
probing formats, we demonstrate significant performance drops of up to 31% on
evolveQA compared to static knowledge questions.

Motivation: 开发不依赖大型语言模型的检索增强生成(RAG)的问答系统，通过知识图谱检索和复述技术实现高效问答。

Method: 采用两阶段流水线：第一阶段预处理文档生成问答对，第二阶段将问答对转换为知识图谱，使用嵌入和模糊技术进行图检索，然后查询、重排序和复述生成最终答案。

Result: 在CRAG基准测试中使用LLM-as-a-judge评估，使用LLAMA-3.2和GPT-3.5-Turbo分别达到71.9%和54.4%的准确率。

Conclusion: 证明了不依赖LLM RAG的纯知识图谱检索问答系统的可行性，通过小型复述模型和知识图谱技术实现了有效的问答性能。

Abstract: This paper presents a question answering system that operates exclusively on
a knowledge graph retrieval without relying on retrieval augmented generation
(RAG) with large language models (LLMs). Instead, a small paraphraser model is
used to paraphrase the entity relationship edges retrieved from querying the
knowledge graph. The proposed pipeline is divided into two main stages. The
first stage involves pre-processing a document to generate sets of
question-answer (QA) pairs. The second stage converts these QAs into a
knowledge graph from which graph-based retrieval is performed using embeddings
and fuzzy techniques. The graph is queried, re-ranked, and paraphrased to
generate a final answer. This work includes an evaluation using LLM-as-a-judge
on the CRAG benchmark, which resulted in accuracies of 71.9% and 54.4% using
LLAMA-3.2 and GPT-3.5-Turbo, respectively.

Motivation: 现有评估方法无法捕捉多轮工具增强对话中的关键错误，例如代理误解工具结果但用户仍感到满意的情况。

Method: 引入TRACE基准（系统合成的工具增强对话数据集）和SCOPE评估框架（自动发现错误模式和评估标准）。

Result: 实验表明SCOPE显著优于基线方法，特别是在用户满意度信号具有误导性的挑战性案例上。

Conclusion: TRACE和SCOPE能够有效评估工具增强对话AI系统，发现传统方法难以捕捉的关键错误。

Abstract: Evaluating conversational AI systems that use external tools is challenging,
as errors can arise from complex interactions among user, agent, and tools.
While existing evaluation methods assess either user satisfaction or agents'
tool-calling capabilities, they fail to capture critical errors in multi-turn
tool-augmented dialogues-such as when agents misinterpret tool results yet
appear satisfactory to users. We introduce TRACE, a benchmark of systematically
synthesized tool-augmented conversations covering diverse error cases, and
SCOPE, an evaluation framework that automatically discovers diverse error
patterns and evaluation rubrics in tool-augmented dialogues. Experiments show
SCOPE significantly outperforms the baseline, particularly on challenging cases
where user satisfaction signals are misleading.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM路由系统依赖固定的集中式外部路由器，无法充分理解不同LLM的知识边界，导致性能不佳且缺乏灵活性。

Method: 提出DiSRouter分布式自路由框架，采用两阶段自我意识训练增强LLM的自我认知能力，让每个LLM代理独立判断自身能力并决定路由。

Result: 实验表明DiSRouter在各种场景下显著优于现有路由方法，能有效区分简单和复杂查询，并对域外任务表现出强泛化能力。

Conclusion: 利用LLM内在自我意识比外部评估更有效，为模块化和高效的多智能体系统开辟了新途径。

Abstract: The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) has created a diverse
ecosystem of models with highly varying performance and costs, necessitating
effective query routing to balance performance and expense. Current routing
systems often rely on a centralized external router trained on a fixed set of
LLMs, making them inflexible and prone to poor performance since the small
router can not fully understand the knowledge boundaries of different LLMs. We
introduce DiSRouter (Distributed Self-Router), a novel paradigm that shifts
from centralized control to distributed routing. In DiSRouter, a query
traverses a network of LLM agents, each independently deciding whether to
answer or route to other agents based on its own self-awareness, its ability to
judge its competence. This distributed design offers superior flexibility,
scalability, and generalizability. To enable this, we propose a two-stage
Self-Awareness Training pipeline that enhances each LLM's self-awareness.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that DiSRouter significantly outperforms
existing routing methods in utility across various scenarios, effectively
distinguishes between easy and hard queries, and shows strong generalization to
out-of-domain tasks. Our work validates that leveraging an LLM's intrinsic
self-awareness is more effective than external assessment, paving the way for
more modular and efficient multi-agent systems.

Motivation: 现有语言知识库如URIEL+存在两个关键局限：一刀切的向量表示不适合语言数据的多样结构，缺乏将多种信号聚合为单一综合得分的系统方法。

Method: 为每种距离类型提出新颖的结构感知表示：地理距离使用说话者加权分布，谱系距离使用双曲嵌入，类型学距离使用潜变量模型，并将这些信号统一为鲁棒的任务无关复合距离。

Result: 在跨语言迁移任务中，提出的表示和复合距离在广泛的NLP任务上持续提升性能。

Conclusion: 该框架为多语言研究提供了更系统有效的工具包，通过类型匹配的距离表示显著改善了跨语言迁移效果。

Abstract: Existing linguistic knowledge bases such as URIEL+ provide valuable
geographic, genetic and typological distances for cross-lingual transfer but
suffer from two key limitations. One, their one-size-fits-all vector
representations are ill-suited to the diverse structures of linguistic data,
and two, they lack a principled method for aggregating these signals into a
single, comprehensive score. In this paper, we address these gaps by
introducing a framework for type-matched language distances. We propose novel,
structure-aware representations for each distance type: speaker-weighted
distributions for geography, hyperbolic embeddings for genealogy, and a latent
variables model for typology. We unify these signals into a robust,
task-agnostic composite distance. In selecting transfer languages, our
representations and composite distances consistently improve performance across
a wide range of NLP tasks, providing a more principled and effective toolkit
for multilingual research.

Abstract: Understanding and reasoning over complex spreadsheets remain fundamental
challenges for large language models (LLMs), which often struggle with
accurately capturing the complex structure of tables and ensuring reasoning
correctness. In this work, we propose SheetBrain, a neuro-symbolic dual
workflow agent framework designed for accurate reasoning over tabular data,
supporting both spreadsheet question answering and manipulation tasks.
SheetBrain comprises three core modules: an understanding module, which
produces a comprehensive overview of the spreadsheet - including sheet summary
and query-based problem insight to guide reasoning; an execution module, which
integrates a Python sandbox with preloaded table-processing libraries and an
Excel helper toolkit for effective multi-turn reasoning; and a validation
module, which verifies the correctness of reasoning and answers, triggering
re-execution when necessary. We evaluate SheetBrain on multiple public tabular
QA and manipulation benchmarks, and introduce SheetBench, a new benchmark
targeting large, multi-table, and structurally complex spreadsheets.
Experimental results show that SheetBrain significantly improves accuracy on
both existing benchmarks and the more challenging scenarios presented in
SheetBench. Our code is publicly available at

Abstract: Difficulty-controllable question generation for reading comprehension has
gained significant attention in the field of education as a fundamental tool
for adaptive learning support. Although several neural question generation
methods have recently succeeded in controlling difficulty, conventional
approaches still face two major limitations. First, they cannot directly
generate multiple-choice questions, which are the most widely used question
type in educational contexts. Second, they are not explicitly trained to
optimize the accuracy of difficulty control, leaving room for further
improvement in difficulty controllability. To address these limitations, this
study proposes a novel difficulty-controllable multiple-choice question
generation method for reading comprehension which leverages a large language
model trained using a direct preference optimization technique to improve the
accuracy of difficulty control.

available tools for Large Language Models (LLMs) has increased significantly.
These task-specific tool sets offer an alternative to general-purpose tools
such as web browsers, while being easier to develop and maintain than GUIs.
However, current general-purpose agents predominantly rely on web browsers for
interacting with the environment. Here, we introduce TheMCPCompany, a benchmark
for evaluating tool-calling agents on tasks that involve interacting with
various real-world services. We use the REST APIs of these services to create
MCP servers, which include over 18,000 tools. We also provide manually
annotated ground-truth tools for each task. In our experiments, we use the
ground truth tools to show the potential of tool-calling agents for both
improving performance and reducing costs assuming perfect tool retrieval. Next,
we explore agent performance using tool retrieval to study the real-world
practicality of tool-based agents. While all models with tool retrieval perform
similarly or better than browser-based agents, smaller models cannot take full
advantage of the available tools through retrieval. On the other hand, GPT-5's
performance with tool retrieval is very close to its performance with
ground-truth tools. Overall, our work shows that the most advanced reasoning
models are effective at discovering tools in simpler environments, but
seriously struggle with navigating complex enterprise environments.
TheMCPCompany reveals that navigating tens of thousands of tools and combining
them in non-trivial ways to solve complex problems is still a challenging task
for current models and requires both better reasoning and better retrieval
models.

*Fan Xu,Huixuan Zhang,Zhenliang Zhang,Jiahao Wang,Xiaojun Wan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: JointCQ是一个联合声明-查询生成框架，通过精心设计的评估标准筛选训练数据，微调语言模型进行联合声明提取和查询生成，在多个开放域问答幻觉检测基准上优于先前方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型存在幻觉问题，现有的幻觉检测方法在声明提取和查询生成阶段存在上下文丢失和特异性不足等限制，导致整个检测流程性能下降。

Method: 开发JointCQ框架，设计评估标准筛选合成训练数据，微调语言模型进行联合声明提取和查询生成，为下游搜索和验证提供可靠输入。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在多个开放域问答幻觉检测基准上优于先前方法。

Conclusion: JointCQ框架推进了更可信和透明的语言模型系统的目标。

Abstract: Current large language models (LLMs) often suffer from hallucination issues,
i,e, generating content that appears factual but is actually unreliable. A
typical hallucination detection pipeline involves response decomposition (i.e.,
claim extraction), query generation, evidence collection (i.e., search or
retrieval), and claim verification. However, existing methods exhibit
limitations in the first two stages, such as context loss during claim
extraction and low specificity in query generation, resulting in degraded
performance across the hallucination detection pipeline. In this work, we
introduce JointCQ https://github.com/pku0xff/JointCQ, a joint claim-and-query
generation framework designed to construct an effective and efficient
claim-query generator. Our framework leverages elaborately designed evaluation
criteria to filter synthesized training data, and finetunes a language model
for joint claim extraction and query generation, providing reliable and
informative inputs for downstream search and verification. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method outperforms previous methods on multiple
open-domain QA hallucination detection benchmarks, advancing the goal of more
trustworthy and transparent language model systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: KORE方法通过知识导向的数据增强和约束，在大型多模态模型中注入新知识的同时保留旧知识，解决了知识更新中的灾难性遗忘问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型多模态模型的预训练知识是静态的，无法跟上现实世界的发展，需要有效的方法来注入新知识并保留旧知识，现有方法往往难以学习新知识且容易发生灾难性遗忘。

Method: KORE方法包含两个核心组件：1）将单个知识项自动转换为结构化知识的知识导向增强；2）将先前知识存储在协方差矩阵中，并通过投影到零空间来初始化适配器，最小化对先前知识的干扰。

Result: 在LLaVA-v1.5-7B、LLaVA-v1.5-13B和Qwen2.5-VL-7B等多种LMM上的广泛实验表明，KORE实现了优越的新知识注入性能，并有效缓解了灾难性遗忘。

Conclusion: KORE通过知识导向的增强和约束，成功解决了大型多模态模型的知识注入和保留问题，实现了准确的知识适应和强大的知识保留能力。

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models encode extensive factual knowledge in their
pre-trained weights. However, its knowledge remains static and limited, unable
to keep pace with real-world developments, which hinders continuous knowledge
acquisition. Effective knowledge injection thus becomes critical, involving two
goals: knowledge adaptation (injecting new knowledge) and knowledge retention
(preserving old knowledge). Existing methods often struggle to learn new
knowledge and suffer from catastrophic forgetting. To address this, we propose
KORE, a synergistic method of KnOwledge-oRientEd augmentations and constraints
for injecting new knowledge into large multimodal models while preserving old
knowledge. Unlike general text or image data augmentation, KORE automatically
converts individual knowledge items into structured and comprehensive knowledge
to ensure that the model accurately learns new knowledge, enabling accurate
adaptation. Meanwhile, KORE stores previous knowledge in the covariance matrix
of LMM's linear layer activations and initializes the adapter by projecting the
original weights into the matrix's null space, defining a fine-tuning direction
that minimizes interference with previous knowledge, enabling powerful
retention. Extensive experiments on various LMMs, including LLaVA-v1.5-7B,
LLaVA-v1.5-13B, and Qwen2.5-VL-7B, show that KORE achieves superior new
knowledge injection performance and effectively mitigates catastrophic
forgetting.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个包含11个类别的幻觉分类法，并开发了HAD模型，将幻觉检测、跨度识别和修正集成到单一推理过程中。模型在约9万样本的合成数据集上训练，在多个基准测试中达到最先进水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着自然语言生成模型的广泛应用，模型产生看似合理但错误信息的幻觉问题日益严重，需要有效的检测和修正方法。

Method: 提出了综合幻觉分类法，开发了HAD模型集成检测、识别和修正功能，使用约9万合成样本训练，并创建了包含2248样本的HADTest测试集。

Result: 在领域内和领域外测试集上，HAD模型普遍优于现有基线，在HaluEval、FactCHD和FaithBench基准上达到最先进结果。

Conclusion: HAD模型展示了在多种NLG任务中的鲁棒性和多功能性，为幻觉检测提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: The increasing reliance on natural language generation (NLG) models,
particularly large language models, has raised concerns about the reliability
and accuracy of their outputs. A key challenge is hallucination, where models
produce plausible but incorrect information. As a result, hallucination
detection has become a critical task. In this work, we introduce a
comprehensive hallucination taxonomy with 11 categories across various NLG
tasks and propose the HAllucination Detection (HAD) models
https://github.com/pku0xff/HAD, which integrate hallucination detection,
span-level identification, and correction into a single inference process.
Trained on an elaborate synthetic dataset of about 90K samples, our HAD models
are versatile and can be applied to various NLG tasks. We also carefully
annotate a test set for hallucination detection, called HADTest, which contains
2,248 samples. Evaluations on in-domain and out-of-domain test sets show that
our HAD models generally outperform the existing baselines, achieving
state-of-the-art results on HaluEval, FactCHD, and FaithBench, confirming their
robustness and versatility.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于超体积优化的多目标强化学习策略HVO，用于优化文本摘要的多个目标（一致性、连贯性、相关性和流畅性），在多个数据集上表现优于GRPO方法，7B模型增强后性能接近GPT-4。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文本摘要需要同时优化多个目标，但现有基于LLM的强化学习方法很少关注多目标优化问题。

Method: 使用超体积方法在RL奖励过程中动态调整组间分数，引导模型逐步逼近帕累托前沿，生成平衡的多目标摘要。

Result: 在多个代表性摘要数据集上，HVO方法在总体得分上优于GRPO，在不同维度上表现更平衡，7B基础模型增强后性能与GPT-4相当且生成长度更短。

Conclusion: HVO是一种有效的多目标优化策略，能够生成平衡的摘要，在保持较短生成长度的同时达到与GPT-4相当的性能。

Abstract: Text summarization is a crucial task that requires the simultaneous
optimization of multiple objectives, including consistency, coherence,
relevance, and fluency, which presents considerable challenges. Although large
language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance, enhanced by
reinforcement learning (RL), few studies have focused on optimizing the
multi-objective problem of summarization through RL based on LLMs. In this
paper, we introduce hypervolume optimization (HVO), a novel optimization
strategy that dynamically adjusts the scores between groups during the reward
process in RL by using the hypervolume method. This method guides the model's
optimization to progressively approximate the pareto front, thereby generating
balanced summaries across multiple objectives. Experimental results on several
representative summarization datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms
group relative policy optimization (GRPO) in overall scores and shows more
balanced performance across different dimensions. Moreover, a 7B foundation
model enhanced by HVO performs comparably to GPT-4 in the summarization task,
while maintaining a shorter generation length. Our code is publicly available
at https://github.com/ai4business-LiAuto/HVO.git

TL;DR: 在语音大语言模型中集成推理能力，通过思维链框架将槽填充任务分解为多个推理步骤，提升端到端槽填充性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受推理LLMs近期发展的启发，将推理能力集成到语音大语言模型中，以改进端到端槽填充任务的性能。

Method: 使用思维链框架分解槽填充任务，创建推理数据集，并对语音LLM应用监督微调策略。区分常规和推理语音LLMs，实验不同类型和大小的LLMs作为文本基础模型。

Result: 引入推理（中间）步骤带来性能提升，但主要为数学、逻辑和编码领域开发的推理文本LLM作为推理语音LLM的基础模型可能表现较差。混合语音LLMs（基于混合文本基础LLM并微调以保持直接和推理两种操作模式）比仅使用单一操作模式微调的模型性能更好。

Conclusion: 在语音LLMs中集成推理能力可以提升槽填充性能，但需要选择合适的文本基础模型，混合操作模式的语音LLMs表现最佳。

Abstract: We propose integration of reasoning into speech large language models
(speechLLMs) for the end-to-end slot-filling task. Inspired by the recent
development of reasoning LLMs, we use a chain-of-thought framework to decompose
the slot-filling task into multiple reasoning steps, create a reasoning dataset
and apply the supervised fine-tuning strategy to a speechLLM. We distinguish
between regular and reasoning speechLLMs and experiment with different types
and sizes of LLMs as their text foundation models. We demonstrate performance
improvements by introducing reasoning (intermediate) steps. However, we show
that a reasoning textual LLM developed mainly for math, logic and coding
domains might be inferior as a foundation model for a reasoning speechLLM. We
further show that hybrid speechLLMs, built on a hybrid text foundation LLM and
fine-tuned to preserve both direct and reasoning modes of operation, have
better performance than those fine-tuned employing only one mode of operation.

Motivation: 将心理学中的群体身份洞察与先进NLP技术相结合，研究将社会人口属性融入LLMs是否能解决自动仇恨言论检测中的偏见问题。

Method: 使用Google的Gemini和OpenAI的GPT-4.1-mini模型，采用两种身份提示方法：浅层身份提示和基于检索增强生成的深度情境化身份开发，以纳入更丰富的身份特征。

Result: 分析了使用群体内和群体外标注者身份对模型检测性能和公平性的影响，结果显示基于身份的方法在减少偏见方面既有潜力也有局限性。

Conclusion: 基于身份的方法为开发更公平的仇恨言论检测系统提供了有价值的见解，展示了将社会人口属性融入LLMs在解决偏见问题上的作用。

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate how personalising Large Language Models
(Persona-LLMs) with annotator personas affects their sensitivity to hate
speech, particularly regarding biases linked to shared or differing identities
between annotators and targets. To this end, we employ Google's Gemini and
OpenAI's GPT-4.1-mini models and two persona-prompting methods: shallow persona
prompting and a deeply contextualised persona development based on
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to incorporate richer persona profiles. We
analyse the impact of using in-group and out-group annotator personas on the
models' detection performance and fairness across diverse social groups. This
work bridges psychological insights on group identity with advanced NLP
techniques, demonstrating that incorporating socio-demographic attributes into
LLMs can address bias in automated hate speech detection. Our results highlight
both the potential and limitations of persona-based approaches in reducing
bias, offering valuable insights for developing more equitable hate speech
detection systems.

TL;DR: LOGICAL是一个基于微调GLiNER模型的本地化PII去除系统，在临床笔记中高效去除个人身份信息，性能优于大型语言模型，适合资源受限环境。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型语言模型在临床笔记PII去除中的高计算成本和数据隐私风险问题，特别是在低资源环境中。

Method: 使用微调的GLiNER模型，在1515份临床文档上定义9个PII类别进行去除，并与多个现有系统进行比较。

Result: 微调GLiNER模型取得0.980的F1分数，显著优于Gemini-Pro-2.5（0.845），95%的文档完全正确清理，在标准笔记本电脑上高效运行。

Conclusion: 微调的专业化transformer模型如GLiNER为临床笔记PII去除提供了准确、计算高效且安全的解决方案，是资源密集型LLMs的实用替代方案。

Abstract: Removing Personally Identifiable Information (PII) from clinical notes in
Electronic Health Records (EHRs) is essential for research and AI development.
While Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful, their high computational costs
and the data privacy risks of API-based services limit their use, especially in
low-resource settings. To address this, we developed LOGICAL (Local Obfuscation
by GLINER for Impartial Context-Aware Lineage), an efficient, locally
deployable PII removal system built on a fine-tuned Generalist and Lightweight
Named Entity Recognition (GLiNER) model. We used 1515 clinical documents from a
psychiatric hospital's EHR system. We defined nine PII categories for removal.
A modern-gliner-bi-large-v1.0 model was fine-tuned on 2849 text instances and
evaluated on a test set of 376 instances using character-level precision,
recall, and F1-score. We compared its performance against Microsoft Azure NER,
Microsoft Presidio, and zero-shot prompting with Gemini-Pro-2.5 and
Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct. The fine-tuned GLiNER model achieved superior
performance, with an overall micro-average F1-score of 0.980, significantly
outperforming Gemini-Pro-2.5 (F1-score: 0.845). LOGICAL correctly sanitised 95%
of documents completely, compared to 64% for the next-best solution. The model
operated efficiently on a standard laptop without a dedicated GPU. However, a
2% entity-level false negative rate underscores the need for human-in-the-loop
validation across all tested systems. Fine-tuned, specialised transformer
models like GLiNER offer an accurate, computationally efficient, and secure
solution for PII removal from clinical notes. This "sanitisation at the source"
approach is a practical alternative to resource-intensive LLMs, enabling the
creation of de-identified datasets for research and AI development while
preserving data privacy, particularly in resource-constrained environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究人类对话中多模态线索（如语音、手势和注视）在话轮转换中的作用，特别是手势作为补充线索的重要性。

Method: 扩展了多参与者DnD Gesture语料库，添加了语义手势标注，并使用专家混合框架整合文本、音频和手势特征来建模话轮转换预测。

Result: 实验表明，加入语义引导的手势特征相比基线模型带来了持续的性能提升。

Conclusion: 手势在多模态话轮转换中发挥着补充作用，语义手势的加入能有效提升预测性能。

Abstract: In conversation, humans use multimodal cues, such as speech, gestures, and
gaze, to manage turn-taking. While linguistic and acoustic features are
informative, gestures provide complementary cues for modeling these
transitions. To study this, we introduce DnD Gesture++, an extension of the
multi-party DnD Gesture corpus enriched with 2,663 semantic gesture annotations
spanning iconic, metaphoric, deictic, and discourse types. Using this dataset,
we model turn-taking prediction through a Mixture-of-Experts framework
integrating text, audio, and gestures. Experiments show that incorporating
semantically guided gestures yields consistent performance gains over
baselines, demonstrating their complementary role in multimodal turn-taking.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: M3-SLU是一个新的多模态大语言模型基准，用于评估多说话人、多轮对话的口语理解能力，特别关注说话人归属推理问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然现有模型在语音和文本理解方面表现良好，但在理解自然对话中谁在何时说了什么（说话人归属推理）方面仍存在困难。

Method: 基于四个开放语料库构建了包含12,000多个验证实例的数据集，包含音频、转录文本和元数据，设计了说话人归属问答和说话人归属匹配两个任务。

Result: 结果显示模型能够捕捉说了什么内容，但经常无法识别谁说的，揭示了说话人感知对话理解的关键差距。

Conclusion: M3-SLU作为一个具有挑战性的基准，旨在推动说话人感知多模态理解的研究进展。

Abstract: We present M3-SLU, a new multimodal large language model (MLLM) benchmark for
evaluating multi-speaker, multi-turn spoken language understanding. While
recent models show strong performance in speech and text comprehension, they
still struggle with speaker-attributed reasoning, the ability to understand who
said what and when in natural conversations. M3-SLU is built from four open
corpora (CHiME-6, MELD, MultiDialog, and AMI) and comprises over 12,000
validated instances with paired audio, transcripts, and metadata. It includes
two tasks: (1) Speaker-Attributed Question Answering and (2) Speaker
Attribution via Utterance Matching. We provide baseline results for both
cascaded pipelines and end-to-end MLLMs, evaluated using an LLM-as-Judge and
accuracy metrics. Results show that while models can capture what was said,
they often fail to identify who said it, revealing a key gap in speaker-aware
dialogue understanding. M3-SLU offers as a challenging benchmark to advance
research in speaker-aware multimodal understanding.

Motivation: 当前用于改进LLM推理的数据集生成方法存在生成低质量/错误答案以及从可用数据源中获取信息丰富度有限的问题。

Method: 四阶段流程：1)种子问题筛选；2)智能问题重述；3)答案增强；4)问答对评估。使用多智能体系统生成多样化、逻辑一致的改写，并通过思维链推理增强答案的正确性。

Result: 在3B-8B参数的LLM上使用AgenticMath生成的数据集（仅3-6万数学样本）进行微调，在多样化的领域内和领域外数学推理基准上达到或超越了使用更多数据（如40万或230万样本）的基线模型性能。

Conclusion: 定向、高质量的数据生成是改进LLM数学推理的更有效途径，优于大规模、低质量的替代方案。

Abstract: The creation of high-quality datasets to improve Large Language Model (LLM)
reasoning remains a significant challenge, as current methods often suffer from
generating low-quality/incorrect answers and limited information richness from
available data sources. To address this, we propose AgenticMath, a novel
agentic pipeline for generating high-quality mathematical question-answer pairs
to enhance the supervised fine-tuning of LLMs. Our method operates through four
stages: (1) Seed Question Filter that selects questions with high information
richness, complexity, and clarity; (2) an Agentic Question Rephrase step that
employs a multi-agent system to generate diverse, logically consistent
paraphrases; (3) an Answer Augment step where rewrite answers using
chain-of-thought reasoning to enhance numerical and logical correctness,
without reliance on human-provided labels; and (4) a final Question and Answer
Evaluation that retains only the most superior pairs. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that, fine-tuning 3B-8B parameter LLMs on AgenticMath generated
datasets (comprising only 30-60K math samples) achieves competitive or superior
performance on diverse in domain and out-of-domain mathematical reasoning
benchmarks compared to baselines trained on much more data (e.g., 400K or 2.3M
samples). Our work demonstrates that targeted, high-quality data generation is
a more efficient path to improving mathematical reasoning in LLMs than
large-scale, low-quality alternatives.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LoongRL是一种数据驱动的强化学习方法，通过KeyChain技术将短多跳问答转化为高难度长上下文任务，训练模型在16K长度下获得128K长度的推理能力，显著提升长上下文多跳问答准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长上下文推理对大型语言模型至关重要，但现有强化学习方法主要针对短上下文，缺乏针对长上下文推理的高级思维模式训练数据。

Method: 提出KeyChain合成方法，通过在大量干扰文档中插入UUID链来隐藏真实问题，将短多跳问答转化为高难度长上下文任务，训练模型逐步追踪正确链、识别真实问题并推理回答。

Result: 在Qwen2.5-7B和14B上，LoongRL将长上下文多跳问答准确率分别提升23.5%和21.1%，LoongRL-14B达到74.2分，媲美更大的前沿模型，并通过所有128K针在干草堆压力测试。

Conclusion: LoongRL诱导出计划-检索-推理-复查的推理模式，在16K长度训练即可获得128K长度的泛化能力，显著提升长上下文推理性能，同时保持短上下文推理能力。

Abstract: Reasoning over long contexts is essential for large language models. While
reinforcement learning (RL) enhances short-context reasoning by inducing "Aha"
moments in chain-of-thought, the advanced thinking patterns required for
long-context reasoning remain largely unexplored, and high-difficulty RL data
are scarce. In this paper, we introduce LoongRL, a data-driven RL method for
advanced long-context reasoning. Central to LoongRL is KeyChain, a synthesis
approach that transforms short multi-hop QA into high-difficulty long-context
tasks by inserting UUID chains that hide the true question among large
collections of distracting documents. Solving these tasks requires the model to
trace the correct chain step-by-step, identify the true question, retrieve
relevant facts and reason over them to answer correctly. RL training on
KeyChain data induces an emergent plan-retrieve-reason-recheck reasoning
pattern that generalizes far beyond training length. Models trained at 16K
effectively solve 128K tasks without prohibitive full-length RL rollout costs.
On Qwen2.5-7B and 14B, LoongRL substantially improves long-context multi-hop QA
accuracy by +23.5% and +21.1% absolute gains. The resulting LoongRL-14B reaches
a score of 74.2, rivaling much larger frontier models such as o3-mini (74.5)
and DeepSeek-R1 (74.9). It also improves long-context retrieval, passes all
128K needle-in-a-haystack stress tests, and preserves short-context reasoning
capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统MoE模型存在"质量悬崖"问题，只能在少数粗粒度操作点之间选择，无法灵活适应多样化服务等级目标，导致资源过度配置

Method: 分为两个阶段：离线重构引擎将单体专家分解为细粒度"子专家"，使用基于元启发式的分区优化求解器；在线调度引擎通过QoS感知调度利用这种弹性

Result: 在三种不同MoE模型上的评估显示，MoE-Prism比基线提供超过4倍的不同稳定操作点，在严格延迟预算下吞吐量提升19.9%，在有限资源下延迟降低10.36%

Conclusion: MoE-Prism提供了关键的"控制旋钮"来弥合模型-系统差距，实现下一代自适应、高效和QoS感知的AI服务

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models, the state-of-the-art in large-scale AI,
achieve high quality by sparsely activating parameters. However, their reliance
on routing between a few monolithic experts via a top-k mechanism creates a
"quality cliff", offering only a few coarse-grained operating points. This
inflexibility forces a difficult trade-off between cost and quality, preventing
adaptation to diverse Service Level Objectives (SLOs) and leading to
significant resource over-provisioning.
  This paper introduces MoE-Prism, a model-system co-design that transforms
rigid MoE models into elastic services. Our methodology is divided into two
phases. First, an \emph{Offline Refactoring Engine} systematically deconstructs
monolithic experts into fine-grained "sub-experts." This engine employs a
partitioning optimization solver that uses a metaheuristic-based approach to
group neurons, preserving functional locality without requiring retraining.
Second, an \emph{Online Scheduling Engine} leverages this new elasticity
through QoS-aware scheduling. It implements specialized policies to solve
complex system problems, including maximizing throughput in cloud deployments
and managing latency-optimized offloading for memory-constrained devices. Our
evaluation across three different MoE models shows that MoE-Prismprovides over
4 times more distinct, stable operating points than the baseline. This allows
an AI service to dynamically improve throughput by up to 19.9\% under a strict
latency budget or reduce latency by up to 10.36\% under limited resources.
MoE-Prism provides the critical "control knob" to bridge the model-system gap,
enabling the next generation of adaptive, efficient, and QoS-aware AI services.

Abstract: State-of-the-art sign language translation (SLT) systems facilitate the
learning process through gloss annotations, either in an end2end manner or by
involving an intermediate step. Unfortunately, gloss labelled sign language
data is usually not available at scale and, when available, gloss annotations
widely differ from dataset to dataset. We present a novel approach using
sentence embeddings of the target sentences at training time that take the role
of glosses. The new kind of supervision does not need any manual annotation but
it is learned on raw textual data. As our approach easily facilitates
multilinguality, we evaluate it on datasets covering German (PHOENIX-2014T) and
American (How2Sign) sign languages and experiment with mono- and multilingual
sentence embeddings and translation systems. Our approach significantly
outperforms other gloss-free approaches, setting the new state-of-the-art for
data sets where glosses are not available and when no additional SLT datasets
are used for pretraining, diminishing the gap between gloss-free and
gloss-dependent systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 使用语言无关的多模态嵌入监督手语翻译，结合多语言目标增强和视频扰动，提升模型鲁棒性和跨语言泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统手语翻译通常使用单一语言的文本进行训练，限制了可扩展性和跨语言泛化能力。现有方法虽然用文本句子嵌入替代了gloss监督，但仍受限于特定语言和模态。

Method: 采用在多种语言文本和语音上训练的语言无关多模态嵌入来监督SLT，实现直接多语言翻译。提出耦合增强方法，结合多语言目标增强（翻译成多种语言）和视频级扰动，提高模型鲁棒性。

Result: 实验显示在BLEURT指标上相比仅使用文本句子嵌入监督获得一致提升，在低资源设置下改进更显著。

Conclusion: 语言无关嵌入监督结合耦合增强为传统SLT训练提供了可扩展且语义鲁棒的替代方案。

Abstract: Sign language translation (SLT) is typically trained with text in a single
spoken language, which limits scalability and cross-language generalization.
Earlier approaches have replaced gloss supervision with text-based sentence
embeddings, but up to now, these remain tied to a specific language and
modality. In contrast, here we employ language-agnostic, multimodal embeddings
trained on text and speech from multiple languages to supervise SLT, enabling
direct multilingual translation. To address data scarcity, we propose a coupled
augmentation method that combines multilingual target augmentations (i.e.
translations into many languages) with video-level perturbations, improving
model robustness. Experiments show consistent BLEURT gains over text-only
sentence embedding supervision, with larger improvements in low-resource
settings. Our results demonstrate that language-agnostic embedding supervision,
combined with coupled augmentation, provides a scalable and semantically robust
alternative to traditional SLT training.

*Victor Morand,Nadi Tomeh,Josiane Mothe,Benjamin Piwowarski*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ToMMeR是一个轻量级模型（<30万参数），通过探测早期LLM层来识别实体提及，在13个NER基准测试中达到93%的零样本召回率，90%以上的精确度，证明了实体表示存在于早期transformer层中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实体提及检测是信息提取的基础，但也是性能瓶颈。研究旨在探索是否可以从早期LLM层中高效提取实体表示。

Method: 开发轻量级模型ToMMeR，通过探测早期transformer层来识别实体提及边界，使用LLM作为判断器验证预测质量。

Result: 在13个NER基准测试中达到93%的零样本召回率，90%以上精确度；跨模型分析显示不同架构在实体边界识别上高度一致（DICE >75%）；添加span分类头后达到接近SOTA的NER性能（80-87% F1）。

Conclusion: 结构化实体表示确实存在于早期transformer层中，可以通过少量参数高效提取，实体检测是语言建模的自然产物。

Abstract: Identifying which text spans refer to entities -- mention detection -- is
both foundational for information extraction and a known performance
bottleneck. We introduce ToMMeR, a lightweight model (<300K parameters) probing
mention detection capabilities from early LLM layers. Across 13 NER benchmarks,
ToMMeR achieves 93\% recall zero-shot, with over 90\% precision using an LLM as
a judge showing that ToMMeR rarely produces spurious predictions despite high
recall. Cross-model analysis reveals that diverse architectures (14M-15B
parameters) converge on similar mention boundaries (DICE >75\%), confirming
that mention detection emerges naturally from language modeling. When extended
with span classification heads, ToMMeR achieves near SOTA NER performance
(80-87\% F1 on standard benchmarks). Our work provides evidence that structured
entity representations exist in early transformer layers and can be efficiently
recovered with minimal parameters.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统手语翻译系统使用通用seq2seq架构，但往往无法充分利用时间特征，需要改进时空特征学习。

Method: 提出单一模型同时学习时空特征表示和翻译，实现真正的端到端架构。

Result: 在开发集上达到5±1 BLEU分，但在测试集上性能大幅下降至0.11±0.06 BLEU分。

Conclusion: 端到端架构有望更好地泛化到新数据集，但测试集性能表明仍需改进。

Abstract: This paper describes the DFKI-MLT submission to the WMT-SLT 2022 sign
language translation (SLT) task from Swiss German Sign Language (video) into
German (text). State-of-the-art techniques for SLT use a generic seq2seq
architecture with customized input embeddings. Instead of word embeddings as
used in textual machine translation, SLT systems use features extracted from
video frames. Standard approaches often do not benefit from temporal features.
In our participation, we present a system that learns spatio-temporal feature
representations and translation in a single model, resulting in a real
end-to-end architecture expected to better generalize to new data sets. Our
best system achieved $5\pm1$ BLEU points on the development set, but the
performance on the test dropped to $0.11\pm0.06$ BLEU points.

TL;DR: BLiSS 1.0是一个评估认知启发模型的新基准，通过选择性容忍度测试模型对自然学习者错误与人工错误的区分能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 弥合性能导向基准与认知启发模型评估之间的差距，测试模型是否能识别自然学习者错误比人工错误更合理。

Method: 基于280万自然学习者句子构建136,867个控制三元组（正确、学习者、人工），测试模型的选择性容忍度。

Result: 实验表明选择性容忍度与标准语法性是不同能力，性能按训练范式聚类，验证了BLiSS的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: BLiSS是衡量不同训练目标如何影响模型与人类语言习得系统性模式对齐的有效工具。

Abstract: To bridge the gap between performance-oriented benchmarks and the evaluation
of cognitively inspired models, we introduce BLiSS 1.0, a Benchmark of Learner
Interlingual Syntactic Structure. Our benchmark operationalizes a new paradigm
of selective tolerance, testing whether a model finds a naturalistic learner
error more plausible than a matched, artificial error within the same sentence.
Constructed from over 2.8 million naturalistic learner sentences, BLiSS
provides 136,867 controlled triplets (corrected, learner, artificial) for this
purpose. Experiments on a diverse suite of models demonstrate that selective
tolerance is a distinct capability from standard grammaticality, with
performance clustering strongly by training paradigm. This validates BLiSS as a
robust tool for measuring how different training objectives impact a model's
alignment with the systematic patterns of human language acquisition.

TL;DR: MINED是一个评估大型多模态模型时间感知能力的基准，包含6个维度11个任务，涵盖2104个时间敏感知识样本。评估显示Gemini-2.5-Pro表现最佳，大多数开源LMM缺乏时间理解能力。研究发现知识编辑方法可以有效更新LMM中的时间敏感知识。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准设计静态，无法充分评估大型多模态模型对时间敏感知识的理解能力，需要构建专门的时间感知评估基准。

Method: 从维基百科构建MINED基准，包含6个关键维度和11个挑战性任务，由两名专业标注者创建2104个时间敏感知识样本，涵盖六种知识类型。评估15个广泛使用的LMM，并研究通过知识编辑方法更新时间敏感知识的可行性。

Result: Gemini-2.5-Pro获得最高平均CEM分数63.07，大多数开源LMM缺乏时间理解能力。LMM在组织知识上表现最佳，在体育知识上表现最弱。知识编辑方法在单一编辑场景下能有效更新LMM中的知识。

Conclusion: MINED基准揭示了LMM在时间敏感知识理解方面的局限性，知识编辑方法为解决这一问题提供了可行途径，但需要进一步研究多编辑场景下的效果。

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) encode rich factual knowledge via cross-modal
pre-training, yet their static representations struggle to maintain an accurate
understanding of time-sensitive factual knowledge. Existing benchmarks remain
constrained by static designs, inadequately evaluating LMMs' ability to
understand time-sensitive knowledge. To address this gap, we propose MINED, a
comprehensive benchmark that evaluates temporal awareness along 6 key
dimensions and 11 challenging tasks: cognition, awareness, trustworthiness,
understanding, reasoning, and robustness. MINED is constructed from Wikipedia
by two professional annotators, containing 2,104 time-sensitive knowledge
samples spanning six knowledge types. Evaluating 15 widely used LMMs on MINED
shows that Gemini-2.5-Pro achieves the highest average CEM score of 63.07,
while most open-source LMMs still lack time understanding ability. Meanwhile,
LMMs perform best on organization knowledge, whereas their performance is
weakest on sport. To address these challenges, we investigate the feasibility
of updating time-sensitive knowledge in LMMs through knowledge editing methods
and observe that LMMs can effectively update knowledge via knowledge editing
methods in single editing scenarios.

TL;DR: MBR解码在语音到文本任务（ASR和ST）中表现优于波束搜索，在大多数实验设置中提高了准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 鉴于MBR解码在文本到文本生成任务中有效，期望其在语音到文本任务中也能有效。

Method: 在英语和日语上使用Whisper及其衍生模型评估MBR解码在ASR和ST任务中的表现。

Result: MBR解码在大多数实验设置中的准确性优于波束搜索。

Conclusion: MBR解码是离线ASR和ST任务中一种有前景的高精度方法。

Abstract: Recent work has shown that sample-based Minimum Bayes Risk (MBR) decoding
outperforms beam search in text-to-text generation tasks, such as machine
translation, text summarization, and image captioning. On the other hand, beam
search is the current practice for speech-to-text tasks such as automatic
speech recognition (ASR) and Speech Translation (ST). Given that MBR decoding
is effective in text-to-text generation tasks, it is reasonable to expect it to
also be effective for speech-to-text tasks. In this paper, we evaluate MBR
decoding for ASR and ST tasks on English and Japanese using Whisper and its
derivative models. We observe that the accuracy of MBR decoding outperforms
that of beam search in most of the experimental settings we have evaluated. The
results show that MBR decoding is a promising method for offline ASR and ST
tasks that require high accuracy. The code is available at

TL;DR: VideoAgentTrek是一个从YouTube教程视频自动挖掘计算机使用代理训练数据的可扩展管道，无需手动标注，通过Video2Action模块提取GUI交互动作，显著提升代理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 训练计算机使用代理需要大量GUI交互数据，但手动标注成本过高，需要寻找可扩展的自动数据挖掘方法。

Method: 开发Video2Action逆动力学模块，包含视频定位模型和动作内容识别器，从屏幕录制视频中自动提取GUI动作的时间边界、坐标和文本等结构化参数。

Result: 从39,000个YouTube教程视频中自动生成152万交互步骤，在OSWorld-Verified上任务成功率从9.3%提升至15.8%，在AgentNetBench上步骤准确率从64.1%提升至69.3%。

Conclusion: 被动互联网视频可以转化为计算机使用代理的高质量监督数据，为昂贵的手动标注提供了可扩展的替代方案。

Abstract: Training computer-use agents requires massive amounts of GUI interaction
data, but manually annotating action trajectories at scale is prohibitively
expensive. We present VideoAgentTrek, a scalable pipeline that automatically
mines training data from publicly available screen-recorded videos at web
scale, eliminating the need for manual annotation. Our approach addresses a key
challenge: raw videos contain implicit demonstrations but lack explicit action
labels. To solve this, we develop Video2Action, an inverse dynamics module
(IDM) with two components: (1) a video grounding model that detects and
localizes GUI actions with precise temporal boundaries and context, and (2) an
action-content recognizer that extracts structured parameters like click
coordinates and typed text with high fidelity. Applied to 39,000 YouTube
tutorial videos, our pipeline generates 1.52 million interaction steps
automatically. We leverage this data through continued pretraining followed by
supervised fine-tuning. On OSWorld-Verified, our approach improves task success
rates from 9.3% (SFT-only baseline) to 15.8%, a 70% relative improvement. On
AgentNetBench, step accuracy increases from 64.1% to 69.3%. Our results
demonstrate that passive internet videos can be transformed into high-quality
supervision for computer-use agents, providing a scalable alternative to
expensive manual annotation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管成员推理攻击和机器生成文本检测目标不同，但它们的方法都基于语言模型的概率分布，但这两个任务一直独立研究，可能忽略了彼此的方法和见解。

Method: 通过理论证明两个任务的最优度量相同，并进行大规模实证实验，包括7种最先进的MIA方法和5种机器文本检测器，涵盖13个领域和10个生成器。

Result: 发现跨任务性能存在强秩相关性（rho > 0.6），特别是Binoculars方法在MIA基准测试中也达到了最先进性能。

Conclusion: 两个研究社区需要更多的跨任务意识和合作，为此作者开发了MINT统一评估套件，包含15种最新方法。

Abstract: Although membership inference attacks (MIAs) and machine-generated text
detection target different goals, identifying training samples and synthetic
texts, their methods often exploit similar signals based on a language model's
probability distribution. Despite this shared methodological foundation, the
two tasks have been independently studied, which may lead to conclusions that
overlook stronger methods and valuable insights developed in the other task. In
this work, we theoretically and empirically investigate the transferability,
i.e., how well a method originally developed for one task performs on the
other, between MIAs and machine text detection. For our theoretical
contribution, we prove that the metric that achieves the asymptotically highest
performance on both tasks is the same. We unify a large proportion of the
existing literature in the context of this optimal metric and hypothesize that
the accuracy with which a given method approximates this metric is directly
correlated with its transferability. Our large-scale empirical experiments,
including 7 state-of-the-art MIA methods and 5 state-of-the-art machine text
detectors across 13 domains and 10 generators, demonstrate very strong rank
correlation (rho > 0.6) in cross-task performance. We notably find that
Binoculars, originally designed for machine text detection, achieves
state-of-the-art performance on MIA benchmarks as well, demonstrating the
practical impact of the transferability. Our findings highlight the need for
greater cross-task awareness and collaboration between the two research
communities. To facilitate cross-task developments and fair evaluations, we
introduce MINT, a unified evaluation suite for MIAs and machine-generated text
detection, with implementation of 15 recent methods from both tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Transformer language models typically operate with a fixed-length context
window, which has grown in step with large-scale pretraining datasets. In the
BabyLM Challenge, however, many past submissions have defaulted to using much
shorter sequence lengths. We examine the impact of sequence length on BabyLM
pretraining, to answer the simple question: what sequence length should we be
using when training Baby LMs? Using 100M-word training data and fixed compute
budgets, we compare 125M-parameter Mamba and OPT models, finding that although
longer is often better, the optimal length depends on both task and
architecture. Shorter sequences are sufficient for grammatical generalization
tasks whereas longer contexts benefit morphological analogical reasoning tasks.

*Canbin Huang,Tianyuan Shi,Yuhua Zhu,Ruijun Chen,Xiaojun Quan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Lookahead是一个LLM路由框架，通过预测潜在输出表示来指导模型选择，无需完整推理即可实现更明智的路由决策。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有路由方法仅基于输入查询进行分类，忽略了潜在输出的有价值信息，无法捕捉在响应生成过程中出现的隐含意图和上下文细微差别，导致复杂或模糊查询的路由决策不理想。

Method: 提出Lookahead路由框架，通过预测模型输出的潜在表示来"预见"可能的输出，基于这些预测指导模型选择。实现了基于因果语言模型和掩码语言模型的两种方法。

Result: 在七个公共基准测试（包括指令遵循、数学推理和代码生成）上的实证评估显示，Lookahead始终优于现有路由基线，相比最先进方法平均性能提升7.7%。

Conclusion: Lookahead通过预见潜在输出表示，能够更有效地利用异构LLM的多样化优势，显著提升路由性能，特别是在需要深度语义理解的复杂查询场景中。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) routers improve the efficiency of multi-model
systems by directing each query to the most appropriate model while leveraging
the diverse strengths of heterogeneous LLMs. Most existing approaches frame
routing as a classification problem based solely on the input query. While this
reduces overhead by avoiding inference across all models, it overlooks valuable
information that could be gleaned from potential outputs and fails to capture
implicit intent or contextual nuances that often emerge only during response
generation. These limitations can result in suboptimal routing decisions,
particularly for complex or ambiguous queries that require deeper semantic
understanding. To address this challenge, we propose Lookahead, a routing
framework that "foresees" potential model outputs by predicting their latent
representations and uses these predictions to guide model selection, thus
enabling more informed routing without full inference. Within this framework,
we implement two approaches based on causal and masked language models.
Empirical evaluations across seven public benchmarks - spanning instruction
following, mathematical reasoning, and code generation - show that Lookahead
consistently outperforms existing routing baselines, achieving an average
performance gain of 7.7% over the state-of-the-art. Our code is available at

Motivation: 当前语音基础模型的评估在不同任务和模型类型之间是分散的，不同模型在语音处理的不同方面表现出色，需要不同的评估协议。

Method: 提出了一个包含三个正交轴（评估方面、模型能力、任务要求）的分类法，对现有评估和基准进行分类，识别评估缺口。

Result: 分类法提供了一个原则性框架，用于将模型与合适的评估方法对齐，并揭示了系统性缺口，如韵律、交互或推理方面的覆盖有限。

Conclusion: 这项工作为选择、解释和扩展语音模型评估提供了概念基础和实践指南。

Abstract: Speech foundation models have recently achieved remarkable capabilities
across a wide range of tasks. However, their evaluation remains disjointed
across tasks and model types. Different models excel at distinct aspects of
speech processing and thus require different evaluation protocols. This paper
proposes a unified taxonomy that addresses the question: Which evaluation is
appropriate for which model? The taxonomy defines three orthogonal axes: the
\textbf{evaluation aspect} being measured, the model capabilities required to
attempt the task, and the task or protocol requirements needed to perform it.
We classify a broad set of existing evaluations and benchmarks along these
axes, spanning areas such as representation learning, speech generation, and
interactive dialogue. By mapping each evaluation to the capabilities a model
exposes (e.g., speech generation, real-time processing) and to its
methodological demands (e.g., fine-tuning data, human judgment), the taxonomy
provides a principled framework for aligning models with suitable evaluation
methods. It also reveals systematic gaps, such as limited coverage of prosody,
interaction, or reasoning, that highlight priorities for future benchmark
design. Overall, this work offers a conceptual foundation and practical guide
for selecting, interpreting, and extending evaluations of speech models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多语言基础模型在特定语言上微调时经常出现灾难性遗忘，降低在未见语言上的性能。现有文献对此现象的结果存在碎片化，需要系统性研究来明确触发条件。

Method: 使用机器翻译作为测试平台，在不同模型架构、数据规模和微调方法下进行受控实验，分析遗忘触发条件。

Result: 发现模型与数据规模的相对比例是遗忘的主要决定因素；指令跟随能力对保留多语言知识比架构更重要；参数高效微调相比全参数微调在缓解遗忘方面没有明显优势；跨语言对齐可缓解遗忘并促进对未见目标语言的正面迁移。

Conclusion: 多语言微调中的灾难性遗忘主要由模型与数据规模比例决定，指令跟随能力是关键因素，跨语言对齐是有效的缓解策略。

Abstract: Fine-tuning multilingual foundation models on specific languages often
induces catastrophic forgetting, degrading performance on languages unseen in
fine-tuning. While this phenomenon is widely-documented, the literature
presents fragmented results about when forgetting occurs. To address this
ambiguity, we conduct a systematic empirical study using machine translation as
a testbed to identify the conditions that trigger catastrophic forgetting in
multilingual fine-tuning. Through controlled experiments across different model
architectures, data scales, and fine-tuning approaches, we reveal that the
relative scale between model and data size is a primary determinant of
forgetting. Moreover, we demonstrate that a model's instruction-following
ability is more critical for retaining multilingual knowledge than its
architecture. Contrary to assumptions, parameter-efficient fine-tuning offers
no clear advantage over full fine-tuning in mitigating forgetting. Lastly, we
show that cross-lingual alignment can mitigate forgetting while also
facilitating positive transfer to unseen target languages.

Method: 通过与社会科学专家合作，让250名不同人口统计背景的个体填写问卷，开发了包含16个文化类别的PBBQ基准数据集。

Result: 评估显示当前LLMs在波斯文化中表现出显著的社会偏见，且模型输出往往复制人类偏见模式。

Conclusion: PBBQ数据集为波斯语语言模型的偏见评估和缓解提供了基础，揭示了学习表示与文化刻板印象之间的复杂关系。

Abstract: With the increasing adoption of large language models (LLMs), ensuring their
alignment with social norms has become a critical concern. While prior research
has examined bias detection in various languages, there remains a significant
gap in resources addressing social biases within Persian cultural contexts. In
this work, we introduce PBBQ, a comprehensive benchmark dataset designed to
evaluate social biases in Persian LLMs. Our benchmark, which encompasses 16
cultural categories, was developed through questionnaires completed by 250
diverse individuals across multiple demographics, in close collaboration with
social science experts to ensure its validity. The resulting PBBQ dataset
contains over 37,000 carefully curated questions, providing a foundation for
the evaluation and mitigation of bias in Persian language models. We benchmark
several open-source LLMs, a closed-source model, and Persian-specific
fine-tuned models on PBBQ. Our findings reveal that current LLMs exhibit
significant social biases across Persian culture. Additionally, by comparing
model outputs to human responses, we observe that LLMs often replicate human
bias patterns, highlighting the complex interplay between learned
representations and cultural stereotypes.Upon acceptance of the paper, our PBBQ
dataset will be publicly available for use in future work. Content warning:

remains a critical task. Detecting fake news across multiple languages,
particularly beyond English, poses significant challenges. Cross-lingual news
comparison offers a promising approach to verify information by leveraging
external sources in different languages (Chen and Shu, 2024). However, existing
datasets for cross-lingual news analysis (Chen et al., 2022a) were manually
curated by journalists and experts, limiting their scalability and adaptability
to new languages. In this work, we address this gap by introducing a scalable,
explainable crowdsourcing pipeline for cross-lingual news similarity
assessment. Using this pipeline, we collected a novel dataset CrossNews-UA of
news pairs in Ukrainian as a central language with linguistically and
contextually relevant languages-Polish, Russian, and English. Each news pair is
annotated for semantic similarity with detailed justifications based on the 4W
criteria (Who, What, Where, When). We further tested a range of models, from
traditional bag-of-words, Transformer-based architectures to large language
models (LLMs). Our results highlight the challenges in multilingual news
analysis and offer insights into models performance.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于字体风格的对抗攻击方法SAD，利用人类与NLP模型对风格化文本的感知差异来攻击文本分类、机器翻译和多模态任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体中用户使用风格化字体和表情符号表达个性，但这些字体在NLP模型中会被处理为不同token，造成人类与模型感知差异，存在安全隐患。

Method: 设计了Style Attack Disguise (SAD)攻击方法，包含轻量版（查询效率高）和强力版（攻击性能优）两种规模。

Result: 在情感分类和机器翻译任务上对传统模型、大语言模型和商业服务进行实验，证明SAD具有强大的攻击性能，并展示了其在文本到图像、文本到语音等多模态任务中的潜在威胁。

Conclusion: 风格化文本在NLP系统中存在严重安全漏洞，SAD攻击方法有效利用了人类与模型的感知差异，对多种NLP和多模态任务构成威胁。

Abstract: With social media growth, users employ stylistic fonts and font-like emoji to
express individuality, creating visually appealing text that remains
human-readable. However, these fonts introduce hidden vulnerabilities in NLP
models: while humans easily read stylistic text, models process these
characters as distinct tokens, causing interference. We identify this
human-model perception gap and propose a style-based attack, Style Attack
Disguise (SAD). We design two sizes: light for query efficiency and strong for
superior attack performance. Experiments on sentiment classification and
machine translation across traditional models, LLMs, and commercial services
demonstrate SAD's strong attack performance. We also show SAD's potential
threats to multimodal tasks including text-to-image and text-to-speech
generation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LlavaCode框架通过将代码压缩为紧凑的语义表示来改进代码补全，在保持生成质量的同时显著减少推理延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 检索增强生成虽然能提升代码补全效果，但引入上下文会显著增加序列长度，导致推理速度变慢，这在IDE等交互式环境中是严重限制。

Method: 使用小型投影器模块将代码压缩为可由代码LLM解释的紧凑语义表示，将检索上下文减少到仅几个压缩的单标记向量。

Result: 压缩上下文使行补全任务的首次标记时间(TTFT)比完整RAG流水线减少20-38%，同时通过EM和ES指标显著提升代码模型性能，且延迟增加可忽略不计。

Conclusion: LlavaCode框架在保持代码生成质量的同时，通过上下文压缩有效解决了RAG方法在交互式环境中的延迟问题。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation has emerged as one of the most effective
approaches for code completion, particularly when context from a surrounding
repository is essential. However, incorporating context significantly extends
sequence length, leading to slower inference - a critical limitation for
interactive settings such as IDEs. In this work, we introduce LlavaCode, a
framework that compresses code into compact, semantically rich representations
interpretable by code LLM, enhancing generation quality while reducing the
retrieved context to only a few compressed single-token vectors. Using a small
projector module we can significantly increase the EM and ES metrics of coding
model with negligible latency increase. Our experiments demonstrate that
compressed context enables 20-38% reduction in Time-to-First-Token (TTFT) on
line completion tasks compared to full-RAG pipelines.

TL;DR: 该研究比较了微调预训练模型和提示工程在情感检测中的效果，发现在三种不同场景下，微调模型在情感识别方面达到70%以上的指标，而LLMs需要结构化提示设计和情感分组技术来提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然Transformer模型在情感识别领域取得了显著进展，但在处理开放式查询时仍面临挑战，包括上下文歧义、语言变异性以及复杂情感表达的解释困难，这使得通用模型的直接应用变得困难。

Method: 比较微调和提示工程在情感检测中的有效性，包括：(i) 微调预训练模型与使用简单提示的通用LLMs的性能对比；(ii) 不同情感提示设计对LLMs的效果；(iii) 情感分组技术对这些模型的影响。

Result: 实验测试显示，微调预训练模型在情感识别方面达到70%以上的指标。研究还发现LLMs需要结构化提示工程和情感分组来提升性能。

Conclusion: 这些进展有助于改进情感分析、人机交互以及跨领域用户行为的理解。

Abstract: Transformer models have significantly advanced the field of emotion
recognition. However, there are still open challenges when exploring open-ended
queries for Large Language Models (LLMs). Although current models offer good
results, automatic emotion analysis in open texts presents significant
challenges, such as contextual ambiguity, linguistic variability, and
difficulty interpreting complex emotional expressions. These limitations make
the direct application of generalist models difficult. Accordingly, this work
compares the effectiveness of fine-tuning and prompt engineering in emotion
detection in three distinct scenarios: (i) performance of fine-tuned
pre-trained models and general-purpose LLMs using simple prompts; (ii)
effectiveness of different emotion prompt designs with LLMs; and (iii) impact
of emotion grouping techniques on these models. Experimental tests attain
metrics above 70% with a fine-tuned pre-trained model for emotion recognition.
Moreover, the findings highlight that LLMs require structured prompt
engineering and emotion grouping to enhance their performance. These
advancements improve sentiment analysis, human-computer interaction, and
understanding of user behavior across various domains.

TL;DR: DiffAdapt：基于推理轨迹熵分析的轻量级框架，通过难度分类选择不同的推理策略，在不微调基础LLM的情况下减少22.4%的token使用量，同时保持或提高准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在推理时经常生成冗长的思考轨迹，但其效用不明确。研究发现模型在简单问题上存在"过度思考"现象，导致不必要的计算开销。

Method: 分析推理轨迹中token概率的熵模式，发现U形熵分布。基于此开发DiffAdapt框架，使用小型探针分类LLM的最终隐藏状态，为每个问题选择Easy/Normal/Hard推理策略（包括固定提示、温度和最大token长度）。

Result: 在5个模型和8个基准测试上的评估显示，该方法在保持或提高准确性的同时，token使用量最多减少22.4%。

Conclusion: DiffAdapt为计算高效的推理提供了一条实用路径，通过难度自适应策略显著提升推理效率。

Abstract: Recent reasoning Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable
problem-solving abilities but often generate long thinking traces whose utility
is unclear. Our work aims to improve their efficiency, enabling them to reach
high performance without overthinking. First, we analyze the entropy of token
probabilities in reasoning traces. Across three models, we observe a consistent
U-shaped entropy pattern: high entropy on easy problems despite high accuracy,
low entropy on problems with medium difficulty, and high entropy on hard
problems reflecting uncertainty. Specifically, we notice 22--25\% entropy
reduction from easy to medium difficulty regions, suggesting an {overthinking}
phenomenon on easy instances. Building on these insights, we introduce
\textbf{DiffAdapt}, a lightweight framework that selects Easy/Normal/Hard
inference strategies per question based on their difficulty and reasoning trace
entropy. Each inference strategy consists of a fixed prompt, temperature and
maximum token length. In contrast to existing efficiency optimization methods,
our approach does not fine-tune base LLM but a small probe that classifies
LLM's final hidden state, allowing inexpensive adaptation. We comprehensively
evaluate our method on five models and eight benchmarks. Our method achieves
comparable or improved accuracy while reducing token usage by up to 22.4\%,
establishing a practical path toward compute-efficient reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在干扰环境中部署大型模型时面临的语义理解、隐私保护和可预测延迟等挑战，实现边缘优先的设计目标。

Method: 包含四个核心组件：SenseFusion轻量编码器、Edge-RAG本地检索层、PromptRouter成本感知策略和Secure Execution安全执行机制，支持现代服务优化技术。

Result: 在家庭、办公室和诊所部署中，实现亚秒级端到端延迟，减少跨层令牌和带宽成本，通过本地检索提高事实一致性并减少矛盾。

Conclusion: 支持边缘优先设计，将语义理解、隐私保护和可预测延迟视为在干扰环境中部署大型模型的同等重要目标。

Abstract: We present CoSense-LLM, an edge-first framework that turns continuous
multimodal sensor streams (for example Wi-Fi CSI, IMU, audio, RFID, and
lightweight vision) into compact, verifiable semantic tokens and coordinates
with large language models under explicit latency, energy, bandwidth, and
privacy constraints. CoSense-LLM has four parts: (i) SenseFusion, a lightweight
encoder that aligns sensor embeddings with language and compresses them into
short discrete code sequences; (ii) Edge-RAG, a local hybrid retrieval layer
that grounds generation in site specific policies and notes; (iii)
PromptRouter, a cost and uncertainty aware policy that selects edge only
generation, edge plus retrieval, or compact cloud escalation; and (iv) Secure
Execution, an auditable redaction path that enforces data minimization so raw
waveforms never leave the device. The system works with modern serving
optimizations, including paged or streaming KV caches, FlashAttention style
kernels, speculative decoding, and quantized LoRA adapters, and supports on
device personalization and federated updates under non IID drift. Across home,
office, and clinic deployments, CoSense-LLM delivers grounded explanations
while meeting tight service level objectives: it sustains sub second (p95) end
to end latency on edge dominant paths, reduces inter tier token and bandwidth
costs by preferring local retrieval grounded responses, and preserves privacy
by transmitting only discrete codes and redacted metadata. Ablations show that
Edge-RAG improves factual consistency and reduces contradictions, calibrated
uncertainty enables selective abstention and controlled escalations, and KV
plus decoding accelerators lower energy per decision. The results support an
edge first design that treats semantics, privacy, and predictable latency as co
equal goals for large model deployments in interference prone environments.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文研究LLMs是否具备动机警觉能力，即能否像人类一样考虑信息来源的动机来评估内容可信度。研究发现LLMs在受控实验中表现出类似人类的理性推理，但在真实广告场景中表现较差，通过简单干预可显著提升其表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类沟通具有动机性，而LLMs处理的信息也受到人类意图和动机的影响。为了让LLMs在现实世界中有效运作，它们必须能够像人类一样批判性地评估内容，考虑信息来源的动机。

Method: 首先使用认知科学中的受控实验验证LLMs行为是否符合理性模型，然后扩展到更自然的在线广告场景，并测试简单的干预措施来增强动机警觉性。

Result: 在受控实验中，LLMs成功以类似人类的方式对偏颇来源的信息进行折扣；但在在线广告场景中，其推理与理性模型预测不符，部分原因是额外信息分散了注意力。通过增强意图和动机显著性的简单干预，可显著提升LLMs与理性模型的一致性。

Conclusion: LLMs具备对他人动机的基本敏感性，但要推广到新的现实世界场景，还需要对这些模型进行进一步改进。

Abstract: Human communication is motivated: people speak, write, and create content
with a particular communicative intent in mind. As a result, information that
large language models (LLMs) and AI agents process is inherently framed by
humans' intentions and incentives. People are adept at navigating such nuanced
information: we routinely identify benevolent or self-serving motives in order
to decide what statements to trust. For LLMs to be effective in the real world,
they too must critically evaluate content by factoring in the motivations of
the source -- for instance, weighing the credibility of claims made in a sales
pitch. In this paper, we undertake a comprehensive study of whether LLMs have
this capacity for motivational vigilance. We first employ controlled
experiments from cognitive science to verify that LLMs' behavior is consistent
with rational models of learning from motivated testimony, and find they
successfully discount information from biased sources in a human-like manner.
We then extend our evaluation to sponsored online adverts, a more naturalistic
reflection of LLM agents' information ecosystems. In these settings, we find
that LLMs' inferences do not track the rational models' predictions nearly as
closely -- partly due to additional information that distracts them from
vigilance-relevant considerations. However, a simple steering intervention that
boosts the salience of intentions and incentives substantially increases the
correspondence between LLMs and the rational model. These results suggest that
LLMs possess a basic sensitivity to the motivations of others, but generalizing
to novel real-world settings will require further improvements to these models.

Motivation: 理解语言模型在零样本设置下通过提示执行多样化任务的底层机制，探究预训练嵌入如何支持上下文任务解决

Method: 对提示嵌入进行一系列探测实验，分析零样本分类中不同提示模板组合的效果

Result: 提示确实影响表征质量，但这些变化与提示对目标任务的相关性并不一致相关

Conclusion: 挑战了"更相关的提示必然导致更好表征"的假设，并分析了可能导致这种意外行为的因素

Abstract: Prompting is a common approach for leveraging LMs in zero-shot settings.
However, the underlying mechanisms that enable LMs to perform diverse tasks
without task-specific supervision remain poorly understood. Studying the
relationship between prompting and the quality of internal representations can
shed light on how pre-trained embeddings may support in-context task solving.
In this empirical study, we conduct a series of probing experiments on prompt
embeddings, analyzing various combinations of prompt templates for zero-shot
classification. Our findings show that while prompting affects the quality of
representations, these changes do not consistently correlate with the relevance
of the prompts to the target task. This result challenges the assumption that
more relevant prompts necessarily lead to better representations. We further
analyze potential factors that may contribute to this unexpected behavior.

Motivation: 解决普通公民难以理解和应用复杂法律信息的问题，尽管欧盟提供了开放的法律文件访问，但这些资源对非专业人士来说仍然难以探索。

Method: 构建EUDial数据集（来自204个博客的880个对话轮次），并提出LexGuide框架，该框架利用检索增强生成和分层主题组织来结构化对话进展。

Result: 研究表明，主动的结构化导航缩小了法律信息可用性与公民理解之间的差距，EUDial和LexGuide成为推进主动法律对话系统的实用资源。

Conclusion: 主动的结构化对话系统能够有效帮助普通公民理解和应用复杂的法律信息，EUDial数据集和LexGuide框架为法律对话系统的进一步发展提供了重要基础。

Abstract: The accessibility of legal information remains a constant challenge,
particularly for laypersons seeking to understand and apply complex
institutional texts. While the European Union provides open access to
legislation, parliamentary responses, and regulatory documents, these resources
can be challenging for laypeople to explore. In this paper, we introduce
EUDial, a proactive multi-turn dialogue dataset constructed from 204 blogs
curated by the Citizens' Enquiries Unit (AskEP) of the European Parliamentary
Research Service. EUDial contains 880 dialogue turns (averaging 4.3 turns per
dialogue), where each dialogue includes initial questions, structured answers,
and follow-up questions. Beyond dataset construction, we propose the LexGuide
framework that leverages retrieval-augmented generation with hierarchical topic
organization to structure dialogue progression, ensuring both comprehensive
coverage of legal aspects and coherence across conversational turns. The
results demonstrate that proactive, structured navigation closes the gap
between the availability of legal information and citizen comprehension,
establishing EUDial and LexGuide as practical resources for advancing proactive
legal dialogue systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法无法确保LLM按照特定文化规范生成内容，直接微调LoRA权重会引入大量参数，需要更高效的解决方案。

Method: 提出Zhyper框架，使用因子化超网络从文本描述生成上下文感知的LoRA适配器，实现参数高效的文化对齐。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，Zhyper达到与最先进基线相当的性能，同时参数减少26倍，在文化对齐任务中表现出更好的泛化能力和细粒度上下文价值捕捉。

Conclusion: Zhyper提供了一种参数高效的方法来实现大语言模型的文化对齐，在保持性能的同时显著减少参数数量，具有更好的泛化能力。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) conditioning refers to instructing an LLM to
generate content in accordance with the norms and values of a specific culture,
beliefs of a particular political orientation, or any desired text-specified
semantic conditioning. Unfortunately, prompt engineering does not ensure that
LLMs behave in accordance with a desired conditioning due to the inductive bias
of the pre-training and alignment datasets. Prior works have focused on
fine-tuning LLMs by directly conditioning the LoRA weights; however, such
methods introduce a large number of parameters. As a remedy, we propose Zhyper,
a parameter-efficient factorized hypernetwork framework that generates
context-aware LoRA adapters from textual descriptions. Experiments on multiple
benchmarks show that Zhyper achieves competitive performance with up to 26x
fewer parameters than the state-of-the-art baselines. Furthermore, we extend
Zhyper to cultural alignment, demonstrating improved generalization to
out-of-domain settings and a better capturing of fine-grained contextual
values.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在复杂推理任务中存在"浅思"问题，即频繁切换思路而没有充分探索，这限制了模型性能和token效率。

Method: SmartSwitch框架包含感知模块和干预模块：感知模块检测思路切换点并用现成过程奖励模型评估前一个思路的潜力；干预模块在发现高潜力思路被过早放弃时回溯并插入"深化提示"来鼓励深度探索。

Result: 在具有挑战性的数学推理基准测试中，该方法显著提升了不同规模大语言模型的性能。

Conclusion: SmartSwitch是一个简单有效的即插即用推理策略，能够有效解决大语言模型的浅思问题，提升复杂推理能力。

Abstract: The long chain-of-thought (LongCoT) capability is central to the recent
breakthroughs achieved by large language models in complex reasoning tasks.
However, the accompanying issue of ''underthinking'', where models exhibit
shallow reasoning by frequently switching thoughts without sufficient
exploration, limits both performance and token efficiency. To address this
problem, we propose a simple yet effective reasoning strategy: the SmartSwitch
inference framework. This framework can be easily integrated into any large
language model as a plug-and-play solution, continuously monitoring the model's
reasoning process to detect underthinking and guide it toward deeper
exploration of promising but overlooked thoughts. Specifically, the perception
module identifies points where thoughts switch and evaluates the potential of
the preceding thought using an off-the-shelf process reward model (PRM). If a
high-potential thought is found to be prematurely abandoned, the intervention
module interrupts the ongoing inference, backtracks to the point before the
switch, and inserts a "deepening prompt" to encourage further exploration along
that promising path. Extensive experiments on challenging mathematical
reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly enhances the
performance of various large language models of different sizes.

TL;DR: AdaSPEC是一种改进推测解码的方法，通过选择性token过滤在知识蒸馏过程中，提高小模型与大模型的对齐度，从而提升token接受率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统知识蒸馏方法在所有token上最小化KL散度，这与推测解码最大化token接受率的目标不一致，导致小模型难以完全吸收大模型知识。

Method: 使用参考模型识别并过滤难以拟合的token，只在简单token上进行蒸馏，使小模型更好地与大模型对齐。

Result: 在算术推理、指令遵循、编程和摘要等任务上，AdaSPEC在31M/1.4B和350M/2.7B参数配置下均优于DistillSpec，接受率最高提升15%。

Conclusion: AdaSPEC通过选择性token过滤改进了推测解码中的知识蒸馏过程，显著提高了token接受率而不影响生成质量。

Abstract: Speculative Decoding (SD) accelerates large language model inference by
employing a small draft model to generate predictions, which are then verified
by a larger target model. The effectiveness of SD hinges on the alignment
between these models, which is typically enhanced by Knowledge Distillation
(KD). However, conventional KD methods aim to minimize the KL divergence
between the draft and target models across all tokens, a goal that is
misaligned with the true objective of SD, which is to maximize token acceptance
rate. Therefore, draft models often struggle to fully assimilate the target
model's knowledge due to capacity constraints, leading to suboptimal
performance. To address this challenge, we propose AdaSPEC, a novel method that
incorporates selective token filtering into the KD process. AdaSPEC utilizes a
reference model to identify and filter out difficult-to-fit tokens, enabling
the distillation of a draft model that better aligns with the target model on
simpler tokens. This approach improves the overall token acceptance rate
without compromising generation quality. We evaluate AdaSPEC across diverse
tasks, including arithmetic reasoning, instruction-following, coding, and
summarization, using model configurations of 31M/1.4B and 350M/2.7B parameters.
Our results demonstrate that AdaSPEC consistently outperforms the
state-of-the-art DistillSpec method, achieving higher acceptance rates across
all tasks (up to 15\%). The code is publicly available at

TL;DR: 该论文提出通过模型合并方法改进代码混合NLP任务，相比传统全微调和继续预训练方法，在英印和英西语言对的句子分类任务上获得2-5个F1分数提升，并在跨语言对迁移中表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究模型合并作为代码混合NLP传统适应策略的实用替代方案，旨在更有效地利用未标记数据并提升跨语言迁移能力。

Method: 从多语言基础模型出发：(i)在未标记代码混合文本上进行继续预训练获得适应检查点，(ii)将检查点与基础模型合并，(iii)在下游任务数据上进行微调。使用XLM-R和Llama-3.2-1B模型在英印和英西语言对上进行评估。

Result: 合并模型在句子分类任务中持续优于全微调和CPT->FT方法，F1分数提升2-5分；在跨语言对迁移中，合并检查点比单语英语基线表现更好（TV/TIES变体达到0.65-0.68 F1 vs 全微调的0.61-0.63）。

Conclusion: 模型合并能更有效地利用未标记数据，代码混合知识是低资源语言对更可靠的基板。论文提供了针对不同数据场景的适应方案，并讨论了在更广泛任务和更大模型中的扩展考虑。

Abstract: We study model merging as a practical alternative to conventional adaptation
strategies for code-mixed NLP. Starting from a multilingual base model, we: (i)
perform continued pre-training (CPT) on unlabeled code-mixed text to obtain an
adapted checkpoint, (ii) merge checkpoint with the base model, and (iii)
fine-tune (FT) on the downstream task data. We evaluate our approach for
sentence classification (sentiment and hate speech) task in English-Hindi
(En-Hi) and English-Spanish (En-Es) using XLM-R and Llama-3.2-1B models. Our
results show that merged models consistently outperform full fine-tuning and
CPT->FT. We observe gains of 2--5 points in F1 over full fine-tuning and ~1-2
points over CPT->FT, indicating that unlabeled data is leveraged more
effectively via merging than via CPT alone. Zero-/few-shot prompting with
larger LLMs (e.g., Llama-3.3-70B) lags behind fine-tuned and merged
checkpoints, underscoring limits of in-context learning for code-mixed inputs.
We further test cross-pair transfer by training on En-Hi and evaluating on
En-Ta and En-Ml: merged checkpoints transfer more strongly than
monolingual-English baselines (e.g., TV/TIES variants reaching 0.65-0.68 F1 vs
0.61-0.63 for full fine-tuning), suggesting that code-mixed knowledge is a more
reliable substrate for low-resource pairs. We conclude with adaptation recipes
matched to common data regimes (labeled only; labeled+unlabeled; transfer-only)
and discuss limitations and scaling considerations for broader tasks and larger
models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前合成数据在多语言应用中受限于基于翻译的提示方法，这些方法继承了英语中心框架和风格，忽视了文化维度，限制了模型的泛化能力。

Method: 引入轻量级提示空间优化框架，将翻译后的提示进行系统化转换，包括自然性调整、文化适应和难度增强，应用于12种语言的提示优化。

Result: 在相同数据条件下，相比仅翻译基线，在Global-MMLU准确率提升4.7%，Flores XCometXL提升2.4%，mArenaHard偏好胜率提升35.3%。

Conclusion: 提示空间优化是一个简单而强大的范式，可以构建更鲁棒、文化基础和全球能力更强的多语言LLM。

Abstract: Synthetic data has become a cornerstone for scaling large language models,
yet its multilingual use remains bottlenecked by translation-based prompts.
This strategy inherits English-centric framing and style and neglects cultural
dimensions, ultimately constraining model generalization. We argue that the
overlooked prompt space-the very inputs that define training
distributions-offers a more powerful lever for improving multilingual
performance. We introduce a lightweight framework for prompt-space
optimization, where translated prompts are systematically transformed for
Naturalness, Cultural Adaptation, and Difficulty Enhancement. Using an
off-the-shelf multilingual LLM, we apply these transformations to prompts for
12 languages spanning 7 families. Under identical data conditions, our
approaches achieve substantial and consistent downstream improvements over the
translation-only baseline: +4.7% on Global-MMLU accuracy, +2.4% on Flores
XCometXL and +35.3% wins in preferences on mArenaHard. We establish
prompt-space optimization as a simple yet powerful paradigm for building
multilingual LLMs that are more robust, culturally grounded, and globally
capable.

TL;DR: 提出了Scaf-GRPO框架，通过渐进式训练和分层提示来解决强化学习中的"学习悬崖"问题，显著提升了LLM在复杂数学推理任务上的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于可验证奖励的强化学习方法面临"学习悬崖"现象：当问题远超模型当前能力时，模型持续失败导致零奖励信号，使得优势计算归零，学习梯度消失，阻碍进步。

Method: Scaf-GRPO框架在检测到学习停滞时，渐进式地提供分层提示（从抽象概念到具体步骤），让模型自行构建有效解决方案，而不是直接给出答案。

Result: 在AIME24基准测试中，Qwen2.5-Math-7B模型的pass@1得分相比标准GRPO基线相对提升了44.3%。

Conclusion: 该框架为解锁模型解决超出其能力范围问题的潜力提供了稳健有效的方法论，是扩展LLM自主推理前沿的关键一步。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning from verifiable rewards has emerged as a powerful
technique for enhancing the complex reasoning abilities of Large Language
Models (LLMs). However, these methods are fundamentally constrained by the
''learning cliff'' phenomenon: when faced with problems far beyond their
current capabilities, models consistently fail, yielding a persistent
zero-reward signal. In policy optimization algorithms like GRPO, this collapses
the advantage calculation to zero, rendering these difficult problems invisible
to the learning gradient and stalling progress. To overcome this, we introduce
Scaf-GRPO (Scaffolded Group Relative Policy Optimization), a progressive
training framework that strategically provides minimal guidance only when a
model's independent learning has plateaued. The framework first diagnoses
learning stagnation and then intervenes by injecting tiered in-prompt hints,
ranging from abstract concepts to concrete steps, enabling the model to
construct a valid solution by itself. Extensive experiments on challenging
mathematics benchmarks demonstrate Scaf-GRPO's effectiveness, boosting the
pass@1 score of the Qwen2.5-Math-7B model on the AIME24 benchmark by a relative
44.3% over a vanilla GRPO baseline. This result demonstrates our framework
provides a robust and effective methodology for unlocking a model's ability to
solve problems previously beyond its reach, a critical step towards extending
the frontier of autonomous reasoning in LLM.

TL;DR: Hubble是一套开源大语言模型套件，用于研究LLM记忆化问题，包含标准模型和扰动模型，通过控制插入文本来模拟记忆化风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大语言模型对敏感数据的记忆化风险，理解记忆化机制并探索缓解方法。

Method: 开发标准模型和扰动模型，在训练过程中控制插入文本（如书籍段落、传记、测试集），分析不同参数规模和训练数据量下的记忆化模式。

Result: 发现记忆化风险由敏感数据在训练语料中的相对频率决定；敏感数据若没有持续暴露会被遗忘；增加训练语料规模可以稀释敏感数据；敏感数据在训练早期出现更容易被记忆。

Conclusion: 提出了缓解记忆化风险的最佳实践：通过扩大训练语料稀释敏感数据，以及让敏感数据在训练早期出现。Hubble为记忆化研究、成员推理和机器遗忘提供了理想测试平台。

Abstract: We present Hubble, a suite of fully open-source large language models (LLMs)
for the scientific study of LLM memorization. Hubble models come in standard
and perturbed variants: standard models are pretrained on a large English
corpus, and perturbed models are trained in the same way but with controlled
insertion of text (e.g., book passages, biographies, and test sets) designed to
emulate key memorization risks. Our core release includes 8 models -- standard
and perturbed models with 1B or 8B parameters, pretrained on 100B or 500B
tokens -- establishing that memorization risks are determined by the frequency
of sensitive data relative to size of the training corpus (i.e., a password
appearing once in a smaller corpus is memorized better than the same password
in a larger corpus). Our release also includes 6 perturbed models with text
inserted at different pretraining phases, showing that sensitive data without
continued exposure can be forgotten. These findings suggest two best practices
for addressing memorization risks: to dilute sensitive data by increasing the
size of the training corpus, and to order sensitive data to appear earlier in
training. Beyond these general empirical findings, Hubble enables a broad range
of memorization research; for example, analyzing the biographies reveals how
readily different types of private information are memorized. We also
demonstrate that the randomized insertions in Hubble make it an ideal testbed
for membership inference and machine unlearning, and invite the community to
further explore, benchmark, and build upon our work.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: SBAN是一个大规模多维度数据集，包含300多万个样本（290万良性软件和67.2万恶意软件），每个样本涵盖二进制代码、汇编指令、自然语言描述和源代码四个层次，用于提升大语言模型在软件代码分析中的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为推进大语言模型在软件代码分析领域的预训练和评估，需要能够桥接低级机器表示和高级人类语义的多模态数据集，以支持跨表示学习、软件语义理解和自动化恶意软件检测等研究。

Method: 构建包含二进制代码、汇编指令、自然语言描述和源代码四个互补层次的大规模数据集，每个样本在这四个维度上都有对应表示，形成多模态数据结构。

Result: 创建了包含300多万个样本的SBAN数据集，其中290万为良性软件样本，67.2万为恶意软件样本，为软件代码分析研究提供了丰富的多模态数据资源。

Conclusion: SBAN数据集为构建能够理解代码的智能系统提供了坚实基础，为软件行为挖掘、安全分析改进以及大语言模型在软件代码挖掘任务中的预训练和微调能力增强开辟了新机遇。

Abstract: This paper introduces SBAN (Source code, Binary, Assembly, and Natural
Language Description), a large-scale, multi-dimensional dataset designed to
advance the pre-training and evaluation of large language models (LLMs) for
software code analysis. SBAN comprises more than 3 million samples, including
2.9 million benign and 672,000 malware respectively, each represented across
four complementary layers: binary code, assembly instructions, natural language
descriptions, and source code. This unique multimodal structure enables
research on cross-representation learning, semantic understanding of software,
and automated malware detection. Beyond security applications, SBAN supports
broader tasks such as code translation, code explanation, and other software
mining tasks involving heterogeneous data. It is particularly suited for
scalable training of deep models, including transformers and other LLM
architectures. By bridging low-level machine representations and high-level
human semantics, SBAN provides a robust foundation for building intelligent
systems that reason about code. We believe that this dataset opens new
opportunities for mining software behavior, improving security analytics, and
enhancing LLM capabilities in pre-training and fine-tuning tasks for software
code mining.

TL;DR: XGen-Q是基于Qwen-Coder架构的领域适应大语言模型，专门用于恶意软件检测和分析，通过多阶段提示策略和检索增强生成技术，在复杂代码混淆情况下仍能提供可靠的恶意软件识别和详细取证报告。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有恶意软件检测系统对混淆代码和未知威胁的泛化能力不足，需要更适应性强且可解释的模型来应对网络安全挑战。

Method: 基于Qwen-Coder架构构建，在超过100万个恶意软件样本上进行预训练，采用多阶段提示策略和检索增强生成技术，设计了系统暴露模型于多样化混淆模式的训练流程。

Result: XGen-Q在困惑度上显著优于竞争基线，对新型恶意软件样本表现出强大性能。

Conclusion: 基于大语言模型的方法在可解释和鲁棒的恶意软件分析方面具有广阔前景。

Abstract: Generative AI and large language models (LLMs) have shown strong capabilities
in code understanding, but their use in cybersecurity, particularly for malware
detection and analysis, remains limited. Existing detection systems often fail
to generalize to obfuscated or previously unseen threats, underscoring the need
for more adaptable and explainable models. To address this challenge, we
introduce XGen-Q, a domain-adapted LLM built on the Qwen-Coder architecture and
pretrained on a large-scale corpus of over one million malware samples,
spanning both source and assembly code. XGen-Q uses a multi-stage prompt
strategy combined with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to deliver reliable
malware identification and detailed forensic reporting, even in the presence of
complex code obfuscation. To further enhance generalization, we design a
training pipeline that systematically exposes the model to diverse obfuscation
patterns. Experimental results show that XGen-Q achieves significantly lower
perplexity than competitive baselines and exhibits strong performance on novel
malware samples, demonstrating the promise of LLM-based approaches for
interpretable and robust malware analysis.

TL;DR: C2T-ID方法通过将层次聚类生成的数字文档标识符转换为关键词标识符，平衡了语义表达性和搜索空间约束，在生成式检索中表现优于现有基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决生成式检索中文档标识符设计的核心挑战：数字标识符无法充分利用大语言模型的自然语言理解能力，而纯文本标识符又会导致解码空间过大和早期错误传播问题。

Method: 首先通过层次聚类构建语义数字文档标识符，然后提取高频元数据关键词并迭代地将数字标签替换为聚类中的top-K关键词，最后通过可选的两级语义平滑步骤增强C2T-ID的流畅性。

Result: 在Natural Questions和淘宝产品搜索数据集上的实验表明，C2T-ID显著优于原子标识符、语义码本和纯文本标识符基线方法。

Conclusion: C2T-ID在语义表达性和搜索空间约束之间取得了良好平衡，证明了该方法在生成式检索中的有效性。

Abstract: Designing document identifiers (docids) that carry rich semantic information
while maintaining tractable search spaces is a important challenge in
generative retrieval (GR). Popular codebook methods address this by building a
hierarchical semantic tree and constraining generation to its child nodes, yet
their numeric identifiers cannot leverage the large language model's pretrained
natural language understanding. Conversely, using text as docid provides more
semantic expressivity but inflates the decoding space, making the system
brittle to early-step errors. To resolve this trade-off, we propose C2T-ID: (i)
first construct semantic numerical docid via hierarchical clustering; (ii) then
extract high-frequency metadata keywords and iteratively replace each numeric
label with its cluster's top-K keywords; and (iii) an optional two-level
semantic smoothing step further enhances the fluency of C2T-ID. Experiments on
Natural Questions and Taobao's product search demonstrate that C2T-ID
significantly outperforms atomic, semantic codebook, and pure-text docid
baselines, demonstrating its effectiveness in balancing semantic expressiveness
with search space constraints.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究往往忽视语料库复杂性对密集检索性能的影响，而语料库大小和文档长度是重要因素。

Method: 引入CoRECT框架，包含新策划的数据集集合，对八种代表性压缩方法进行基准测试。

Result: 非学习压缩方法在100M段落上能显著减小索引大小，性能损失统计不显著，但最优压缩方法选择仍具挑战性。

Conclusion: 压缩方法性能因模型而异，凸显了CoRECT框架对于实现一致比较和明智选择压缩方法的必要性。

Abstract: Dense retrieval systems have proven to be effective across various
benchmarks, but require substantial memory to store large search indices.
Recent advances in embedding compression show that index sizes can be greatly
reduced with minimal loss in ranking quality. However, existing studies often
overlook the role of corpus complexity -- a critical factor, as recent work
shows that both corpus size and document length strongly affect dense retrieval
performance. In this paper, we introduce CoRECT (Controlled Retrieval
Evaluation of Compression Techniques), a framework for large-scale evaluation
of embedding compression methods, supported by a newly curated dataset
collection. To demonstrate its utility, we benchmark eight representative types
of compression methods. Notably, we show that non-learned compression achieves
substantial index size reduction, even on up to 100M passages, with
statistically insignificant performance loss. However, selecting the optimal
compression method remains challenging, as performance varies across models.
Such variability highlights the necessity of CoRECT to enable consistent
comparison and informed selection of compression methods. All code, data, and
results are available on GitHub and HuggingFace.

Motivation: Top-K掩码方案被提出作为促进信息检索任务中稀疏表示的简单方法，作为浮点运算正则化的替代方案。现有算法如BLADE将其作为后处理阶段使用，但存在改进空间。

Method: 采用Top-P动态掩码方法，类似于大语言模型中的核采样技术，与传统的Top-K掩码方案进行对比。

Result: 在跨语言信息检索（CLIR）领域评估表明，Top-P动态掩码比Top-K掩码具有更好的性能表现。

Conclusion: Top-P动态掩码在促进稀疏表示方面优于Top-K掩码方案，为信息检索任务提供了更有效的后处理方法。

Abstract: Top-K masking schemes have been proposed as a method to promote sparse
representations in Information Retrieval (IR) tasks, as a simple alternative to
Floating Point Operations per Second (FLOPS) regularization. Algorithms such as
Bilingual Lexical and Document Expansion Model (BLADE), adopt this approach as
a post-processing stage. We propose using Top-P Dynamic Masking similar to
Nucleus Sampling in Large Language Models, and demonstrate better performance
than Top-K masking. Specifically, we evaluate our methods in the domain of

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 该论文研究了基于相互提名的代理人选择问题，提出了使用预测信息来改进公正机制性能的方法，在保证公正性的同时显著提高了选择效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在基于相互提名的代理人选择场景中，代理人可能为了影响自己被选中的机会而虚假提名他人。公正机制虽然能避免这种策略行为，但性能受限。论文探索如何利用对最高提名者的预测信息来提升公正机制的性能。

Method: 提出了结合预测信息的公正选择机制，定义了机制的一致性和鲁棒性指标。对于一般情况（选择k个代理人），给出了具有特定一致性和鲁棒性保证的机制；对于特殊情况（选择单个代理人且每人只能提名一次），设计了1-一致性和1/2-鲁棒性的机制。

Result: 对于一般情况，机制达到1-O(1/k)的一致性和1-1/e-O(1/k)的鲁棒性；对于特殊情况，实现了1-一致性和1/2-鲁棒性。与先前结果相比，在几乎不牺牲鲁棒性的前提下实现了渐进最优的一致性。

Conclusion: 通过引入预测信息，可以显著提升公正选择机制的性能，在保证公正性的同时获得接近最优的选择效果，为委员会选举、AI对齐等应用提供了理论支持。

Abstract: We study the selection of agents based on mutual nominations, a theoretical
problem with many applications from committee selection to AI alignment. As
agents both select and are selected, they may be incentivized to misrepresent
their true opinion about the eligibility of others to influence their own
chances of selection. Impartial mechanisms circumvent this issue by
guaranteeing that the selection of an agent is independent of the nominations
cast by that agent. Previous research has established strong bounds on the
performance of impartial mechanisms, measured by their ability to approximate
the number of nominations for the most highly nominated agents. We study to
what extent the performance of impartial mechanisms can be improved if they are
given a prediction of a set of agents receiving a maximum number of
nominations. Specifically, we provide bounds on the consistency and robustness
of such mechanisms, where consistency measures the performance of the
mechanisms when the prediction is accurate and robustness its performance when
the prediction is inaccurate. For the general setting where up to $k$ agents
are to be selected and agents nominate any number of other agents, we give a
mechanism with consistency $1-O\big(\frac{1}{k}\big)$ and robustness
$1-\frac{1}{e}-O\big(\frac{1}{k}\big)$. For the special case of selecting a
single agent based on a single nomination per agent, we prove that
$1$-consistency can be achieved while guaranteeing $\frac{1}{2}$-robustness. A
close comparison with previous results shows that (asymptotically) optimal
consistency can be achieved with little to no sacrifice in terms of robustness.

Result: 通过理论分析和真实数据集实验，展示了在最大化准确率和期望努力公平性之间的明确权衡关系。

Conclusion: 该研究为战略学习中的公平性权衡问题提供了理论框架和实证证据，强调了在决策系统设计中平衡预测性能和激励公平的重要性。

Abstract: Strategic learning studies how decision rules interact with agents who may
strategically change their inputs/features to achieve better outcomes. In
standard settings, models assume that the decision-maker's sole scope is to
learn a classifier that maximizes an objective (e.g., accuracy) assuming that
agents best respond. However, real decision-making systems' goals do not align
exclusively with producing good predictions. They may consider the external
effects of inducing certain incentives, which translates to the change of
certain features being more desirable for the decision maker. Further, the
principal may also need to incentivize desirable feature changes fairly across
heterogeneous agents. How much does this constrained optimization (i.e.,
maximize the objective, but restrict agents' incentive disparity) cost the
principal? We propose a unified model of principal-agent interaction that
captures this trade-off under three additional components: (1) causal
dependencies between features, such that changes in one feature affect others;
(2) heterogeneous manipulation costs between agents; and (3) peer learning,
through which agents infer the principal's rule. We provide theoretical
guarantees on the principal's optimality loss constrained to a particular
desirability fairness tolerance for multiple broad classes of fairness
measures. Finally, through experiments on real datasets, we show the explicit
tradeoff between maximizing accuracy and fairness in desirability effort.

Abstract: Advertisement auctions play a crucial role in revenue generation for
e-commerce companies. To make the bidding procedure scalable to thousands of
auctions, the automatic bidding (autobidding) algorithms are actively developed
in the industry. Therefore, the fair and reproducible evaluation of autobidding
algorithms is an important problem. We present a standardized and transparent
evaluation protocol for comparing classical and reinforcement learning (RL)
autobidding algorithms. We consider the most efficient autobidding algorithms
from different classes, e.g., ones based on the controllers, RL, optimal
formulas, etc., and benchmark them in the bidding environment. We utilize the
most recent open-source environment developed in the industry, which accurately
emulates the bidding process. Our work demonstrates the most promising use
cases for the considered autobidding algorithms, highlights their surprising
drawbacks, and evaluates them according to multiple metrics. We select the
evaluation metrics that illustrate the performance of the autobidding
algorithms, the corresponding costs, and track the budget pacing. Such a choice
of metrics makes our results applicable to the broad range of platforms where
autobidding is effective. The presented comparison results help practitioners
to evaluate the candidate autobidding algorithms from different perspectives
and select ones that are efficient according to their companies' targets.

Motivation: 研究重复多单位拍卖中不同拍卖格式对投标人学习难度的影响，特别是在电力市场和国债拍卖等实际应用场景中，理解投标人如何在不同拍卖机制下学习最优投标策略。

Method: 通过理论分析比较统一价格拍卖和歧视性拍卖的学习难度，使用遗憾分析框架，考虑完全信息和强盗反馈两种场景，并针对对称单位需求参与者的情况进行具体分析。

Result: 在最坏情况下，两种拍卖格式的遗憾缩放率相似（完全信息：$\tilde{\Theta} ( \sqrt{T} )$，强盗反馈：$\tilde{\Theta} ( T^{2/3} )$），但统一价格拍卖在某些设置下可能达到更快的$\tilde{\Theta} ( \sqrt{T} )$遗憾率，而歧视性拍卖仍保持$\tilde{\Theta} ( T^{2/3} )$。

Conclusion: 虽然两种拍卖格式在最坏情况遗憾下表现相似，但统一价格拍卖具有结构优势，在某些情况下允许更快的收敛速度，这对拍卖机制设计和投标策略选择具有重要启示。

Abstract: Repeated multi-unit auctions, where a seller allocates multiple identical
items over many rounds, are common mechanisms in electricity markets and
treasury auctions. We compare the two predominant formats: uniform-price and
discriminatory auctions, focusing on the perspective of a single bidder
learning to bid against stochastic adversaries. We characterize the learning
difficulty in each format, showing that the regret scales similarly for both
auction formats under both full-information and bandit feedback, as
$\tilde{\Theta} ( \sqrt{T} )$ and $\tilde{\Theta} ( T^{2/3} )$, respectively.
However, analysis beyond worst-case regret reveals structural differences:
uniform-price auctions may admit faster learning rates, with regret scaling as
$\tilde{\Theta} ( \sqrt{T} )$ in settings where discriminatory auctions remain
at $\tilde{\Theta} ( T^{2/3} )$. Finally, we provide a specific analysis for
auctions in which the other participants are symmetric and have unit-demand,
and show that in these instances, a similar regret rate separation appears.

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 本文提出了基于实例相关配额的公平性概念，突破了固定配额的限制，证明了常见投票规则与最优解存在距离，并研究了计算复杂性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的公平性公理（如JR和EJR）依赖于固定配额（如Hare或Droop配额），这限制了公平性概念的灵活性。本文旨在探索实例相关配额的公平性概念。

Method: 引入基于实例相关配额的公平性概念，分析常见投票规则与最优解的距离，研究计算复杂性，并提出整数线性规划（ILP）方法来计算满足α-JR的委员会。

Result: 证明了所有常见投票规则与最优解存在$rac{k^2}{(k+1)^2}$的加性距离；确定满足α-JR的最优α值是NP完全问题；在选民区间（VI）和候选区间（CI）域中获得了积极结果。

Conclusion: 实例相关配额提供了更灵活的公平性框架，虽然计算最优α值是NP完全的，但ILP方法在特定领域是可行的。

Abstract: Justified representation (JR) and extended justified representation (EJR) are
well-established proportionality axioms in approval-based multiwinner voting.
Both axioms are always satisfiable, but they rely on a fixed quota (typically
Hare or Droop), with the Droop quota being the smallest one that guarantees
existence across all instances. With this observation in mind, we take a first
step beyond the fixed-quota paradigm and introduce proportionality notions
where the quota is instance-dependent. We demonstrate that all commonly studied
voting rules can have an additive distance to the optimum of
$\frac{k^2}{(k+1)^2}$. Moreover, we look into the computational aspects of our
instance-dependent quota and prove that determining the optimal value of
$\alpha$ for a given approval profile satisfying $\alpha$-JR is NP-complete. To
address this, we introduce an integer linear programming (ILP) formulation for
computing committees that satisfy $\alpha$-JR, and we provide positive results
in the voter interval (VI) and candidate interval (CI) domains.

TL;DR: CosmoCore是一种受神经科学启发的强化学习架构，通过整合情感信号来增强大语言模型的代码生成能力。它使用轻量级多层感知机为代码生成轨迹标记情感效价和惊喜度，优先重放高负效价（尴尬）的代码错误，同时修剪低惊喜度的成功案例，从而减少幻觉代码48%，加速自我修正45%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受人类和动物学习的启发，特别是从错误中感到尴尬从而快速修正的行为（如训练小狗时一次责备就能避免重复错误），旨在通过情感信号提升代码生成的质量和效率。

Method: 使用轻量级多层感知机为代码生成轨迹标记情感效价和惊喜度；将高负效价（尴尬）的代码错误优先放入Dream Queue进行五倍重放；修剪低惊喜度的成功案例以防止过度自信和缓冲区膨胀。

Result: 在HumanEval和BigCodeBench等代码生成基准测试中，CosmoCore将幻觉代码（如语法错误或逻辑错误）减少了48%，自我修正速度提升了45%。消融实验确认情感效价标记增强了探索好奇心，修剪缓解了效率低下问题。

Conclusion: CosmoCore扩展了基于人类反馈的强化学习（RLHF），为代码助手提供了更情感感知的能力，适用于IDE和数据管道等场景。代码和自定义的小型世界模拟已发布。

Abstract: We introduce CosmoCore, a neuroscience-inspired reinforcement learning (RL)
architecture that integrates affective signals to enhance code generation in
large language models (LLMs). Motivated by human and animal learning where
embarrassment from mistakes drives rapid correction, as observed in training a
puppy to avoid repeating errors after a single scolding CosmoCore tags code
generation trajectories with valence and surprise using a lightweight
multi-layer perceptron (MLP). High-negative valence (cringe) episodes, such as
buggy code outputs, are prioritized in a Dream Queue for five-fold replay
during off-policy updates, while low-surprise successes are pruned to prevent
overconfidence and buffer bloat. Evaluated on code generation benchmarks like
HumanEval and BigCodeBench, alongside simulations with a custom data pipeline
environment, CosmoCore reduces hallucinated code (e.g., syntax errors or
logical bugs) by 48\% and accelerates self-correction by 45\%. Local
experiments using Hugging Face models in a PySpark environment validate these
gains, with code snippets provided for replication. Ablations confirm valence
tagging boosts curiosity in exploration, and pruning mitigates inefficiency.
This framework extends RL from human feedback (RLHF) for more emotionally aware
code assistants, with applications in IDEs and data pipelines. Code and the
custom mini-world simulation are released.

Conclusion: 建议结合单元测试和AI驱动的指导来优化自动反馈机制，改善编程教育的学习成果。

Abstract: With the recent rapid increase in digitization across all major industries,
acquiring programming skills has increased the demand for introductory
programming courses. This has further resulted in universities integrating
programming courses into a wide range of curricula, including not only
technical studies but also business and management fields of study.
  Consequently, additional resources are needed for teaching, grading, and
tutoring students with diverse educational backgrounds and skills. As part of
this, Automated Programming Assessment Systems (APASs) have emerged, providing
scalable and high-quality assessment systems with efficient evaluation and
instant feedback. Commonly, APASs heavily rely on predefined unit tests for
generating feedback, often limiting the scope and level of detail of feedback
that can be provided to students. With the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs)
in recent years, new opportunities have emerged as these technologies can
enhance feedback quality and personalization.
  To investigate how different feedback mechanisms in APASs are perceived by
students, and how effective they are in supporting problem-solving, we have
conducted a large-scale study with over 200 students from two different
universities. Specifically, we compare baseline Compiler Feedback, standard
Unit Test Feedback, and advanced LLM-based Feedback regarding perceived quality
and impact on student performance.
  Results indicate that while students rate unit test feedback as the most
helpful, AI-generated feedback leads to significantly better performances.
These findings suggest combining unit tests and AI-driven guidance to optimize
automated feedback mechanisms and improve learning outcomes in programming
education.

### [165] [Extending Resource Constrained Project Scheduling to Mega-Projects with Model-Based Systems Engineering & Hetero-functional Graph Theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19035)
*Amirreza Hosseini,Amro M. Farid*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 该论文将资源受限项目调度问题与基于模型的系统工程和异质功能图理论相结合，提出了从活动节点网络到SysML活动图再到操作数网络的转换流程，并证明了RCPSP是该理论框架的一个特例。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然资源受限项目调度问题是项目管理的核心，但它与基于模型的系统工程文献脱节，限制了其在复杂系统设计和管理中的集成应用。

Method: 构建了从活动节点网络到SysML活动图再到操作数网络的具体转换流程，并将异质功能网络最小成本流公式专门化应用于RCPSP环境。

Result: 在包含可再生和不可再生操作数的示例实例中，专门的HFNMCF在产生相似调度的同时，能够提供项目状态的明确解释，实现更丰富的监控和控制。

Conclusion: 该框架保留了经典RCPSP的优势，同时适应了大型复杂超大型项目中遇到的实际约束和企业级决策过程。

Abstract: Within the project management context, project scheduling serves as an
indispensable component, functioning as a fundamental tool for planning,
monitoring, controlling, and managing projects more broadly. Although the
resource-constrained project scheduling problem (RCPSP) lies at the core of
project management activities, it remains largely disconnected from the broader
literature on model-based systems engineering (MBSE), thereby limiting its
integration into the design and management of complex systems. The original
contribution of this paper is twofold. First, the paper seeks to reconcile the
RCPSP with the broader literature and vocabulary of model-based systems
engineering and hetero-functional graph theory (HFGT). A concrete translation
pipeline from an activity-on-node network to a SysML activity diagram, and then
to an operand net is constructed. Using this representation, it specializes the
hetero-functional network minimum-cost flow (HFNMCF) formulation to the RCPSP
context as a systematic means of HFGT for quantitative analysis and proves that
the RCPSP is recoverable as a special case of a broader model. Secondly, on an
illustrative instance with renewable and non-renewable operands, the
specialized HFNMCF, while producing similar schedules, yields explicit
explanations of the project states that enable richer monitoring and control.
Overall, the framework preserves the strengths of the classical RCPSP while
accommodating real-world constraints and enterprise-level decision processes
encountered in large, complex megaprojects.

TL;DR: 提出了ReqEBench，一个包含2,721条真实CPS需求的新基准，用于评估自动化需求关注点提取解决方案的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动化需求关注点提取解决方案缺乏公平和全面的基准来评估其有效性，特别是在CPS领域。

Method: 构建包含12个真实CPS系统的2,721条需求的基准，涵盖多个应用领域，并经过严格标注过程。

Result: 使用ReqEBench评估三种自动化解决方案，发现GPT-4在实体关注点提取中的最高F1分数仅为0.24。

Conclusion: ReqEBench将促进自动化需求关注点提取的评估和发展，并揭示了当前LLM解决方案的局限性。

Abstract: Cyber-physical systems (CPSs) are characterized by a deep integration of the
information space and the physical world, which makes the extraction of
requirements concerns more challenging. Some automated solutions for
requirements concern extraction have been proposed to alleviate the burden on
requirements engineers. However, evaluating the effectiveness of these
solutions, which relies on fair and comprehensive benchmarks, remains an open
question. To address this gap, we propose ReqEBench, a new CPSs requirements
concern extraction benchmark, which contains 2,721 requirements from 12
real-world CPSs. ReqEBench offers four advantages. It aligns with real-world
CPSs requirements in multiple dimensions, e.g., scale and complexity. It covers
comprehensive concerns related to CPSs requirements. It undergoes a rigorous
annotation process. It covers multiple application domains of CPSs, e.g.,
aerospace and healthcare. We conducted a comparative study on three types of
automated requirements concern extraction solutions and revealed their
performance in real-world CPSs using our ReqEBench. We found that the highest
F1 score of GPT-4 is only 0.24 in entity concern extraction. We further analyze
failure cases of popular LLM-based solutions, summarize their shortcomings, and
provide ideas for improving their capabilities. We believe ReqEBench will
facilitate the evaluation and development of automated requirements concern
extraction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着嵌入式系统在各行业的广泛应用，需要自动化平台来开发和部署定制的基于Linux的操作系统，以提高开发效率和系统可靠性。

Method: 采用Yocto项目的三层架构（主仓库、自定义层meta-custom、协调清单层），开发了三个示例项目，使用GitLab CI实现CI/CD流水线，结合Docker隔离环境和本地缓存服务器来优化构建流程。

Result: 构建时间显著减少，通过QEMU模拟器的六个启动测试场景验证了系统功能和稳定性，证明该设计不仅确保可复现性，还能扩展到实时Linux版本等高级应用。

Conclusion: 提出的设计为嵌入式系统的工业和科研项目提供了一个稳定、可扩展的模型，具有快速可靠的开发周期，未来可扩展自动化测试、系统监控和分布式构建等优化。

Abstract: With the growing use of embedded systems in various industries, the need for
automated platforms for the development and deployment of customized
Linux-based operating systems has become more important. This research was
conducted with the aim of designing and implementing an integrated and
reproducible infrastructure for the development, building, and testing of a
Linux-based operating system using the Yocto Project. The proposed structure
was implemented based on a three-layer architecture consisting of the main
Yocto repositories, a custom layer (meta-custom), and a coordinating manifest
layer to ensure version synchronization, scalability, and reproducibility.
Three sample projects, including libhelloworld, helloworld, and the kernel
module hello mod, were developed and integrated into the build process.
Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment pipelines were implemented
with GitLab CI and combined with an isolated Docker environment to automate and
streamline the build and testing workflows. Using a local cache server
containing hashserv, downloads and sstate cache significantly reduced the build
time. The functionality and stability of the system were verified through six
boot test scenarios in the QEMU simulator. The results show that the proposed
design not only ensures reproducibility but also can be extended to advanced
applications such as continuous deployment of real-time Linux versions. Future
recommendations include expanding automated tests, implementing system
monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana, using distributed builds, optimizing
with Docker multi-stage builds, and enabling continuous deployment of real-time
Linux changes to provide a stable and scalable model for industrial and
research projects in embedded systems with a rapid and reliable development
cycle.

TL;DR: TRACE是一个针对不可编译智能合约仓库的访问控制漏洞检测工具，它使用LLM定位敏感函数并补全为可编译合约，通过构建函数调用图和CFG来检测访问控制漏洞。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 智能合约中的访问控制漏洞已造成数十亿美元损失，现有工具无法有效处理复杂仓库中的不可编译合约，第三方开发者引用这些有漏洞代码会带来严重安全风险。

Method: 使用LLM定位涉及关键操作的敏感函数，将函数片段补全为完整可编译合约，从AST构建函数调用图，利用每个函数的CFG作为节点信息，分析敏感函数节点检测访问控制漏洞。

Result: 在开源CVE数据集上检测出15个CVE中的14个，在5000个最新链上合约中达到89.2%准确率，远超现有最佳工具的76.9%，在83个真实仓库中达到87.0%准确率，显著超过DeepSeek-R1的14.3%。

Conclusion: TRACE能有效检测不可编译智能合约仓库中的访问控制漏洞，在准确率和实用性方面显著优于现有工具，为智能合约安全提供了重要保障。

Abstract: Smart contract vulnerabilities, particularly improper Access Control that
allows unauthorized execution of restricted functions, have caused billions of
dollars in losses. GitHub hosts numerous smart contract repositories containing
source code, documentation, and configuration files-these serve as intermediate
development artifacts that must be compiled and packaged before deployment.
Third-party developers often reference, reuse, or fork code from these
repositories during custom development. However, if the referenced code
contains vulnerabilities, it can introduce significant security risks. Existing
tools for detecting smart contract vulnerabilities are limited in their ability
to handle complex repositories, as they typically require the target contract
to be compilable to generate an abstract representation for further analysis.
This paper presents TRACE, a tool designed to secure non-compilable smart
contract repositories against access control vulnerabilities. TRACE employs
LLMs to locate sensitive functions involving critical operations (e.g.,
transfer) within the contract and subsequently completes function snippets into
a fully compilable contract. TRACE constructs a function call graph from the
abstract syntax tree (AST) of the completed contract. It uses the control flow
graph (CFG) of each function as node information. The nodes of the sensitive
functions are then analyzed to detect Access Control vulnerabilities.
Experimental results demonstrate that TRACE outperforms state-of-the-art tools
on an open-sourced CVE dataset, detecting 14 out of 15 CVEs. In addition, it
achieves 89.2% precision on 5,000 recent on-chain contracts, far exceeding the
best existing tool at 76.9%. On 83 real-world repositories, TRACE achieves
87.0% precision, significantly surpassing DeepSeek-R1's 14.3%.

TL;DR: 使用基于LLM的多智能体系统自动化RESTful微服务的API优先开发，包括生成OpenAPI规范、生成服务器代码，并通过分析执行日志和错误消息的反馈循环来优化代码。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 推进RESTful Web服务的API优先开发自动化，测试基于LLM的多智能体系统在支持API优先开发方法方面的能力。

Method: 利用基于LLM的智能体生成OpenAPI规范，从中生成服务器代码，并通过分析执行日志和错误消息的反馈循环来完善代码。

Result: 如果保持OpenAPI规范小而专注，LLM能够生成符合规范的完整功能代码和业务逻辑。使用PRAB基准测试验证了系统的潜力。

Conclusion: 基于LLM的多智能体系统可以有效支持API优先开发方法，通过集成日志分析能够高效检测和解决问题，减少生成功能性和健壮服务所需的迭代次数。

Abstract: This paper presents a system that uses Large Language Models (LLMs)-based
agents to automate the API-first development of RESTful microservices. This
system helps to create an OpenAPI specification, generate server code from it,
and refine the code through a feedback loop that analyzes execution logs and
error messages. The integration of log analysis enables the LLM to detect and
address issues efficiently, reducing the number of iterations required to
produce functional and robust services. This study's main goal is to advance
API-first development automation for RESTful web services and test the
capability of LLM-based multi-agent systems in supporting the API-first
development approach. To test the proposed system's potential, we utilized the
PRAB benchmark. The results indicate that if we keep the OpenAPI specification
small and focused, LLMs are capable of generating complete functional code with
business logic that aligns to the specification. The code for the system is
publicly available at https://github.com/sirbh/code-gen

TL;DR: 研究调查了不同编程经验人群对位运算符的可读性和理解能力，发现某些运算符（如OR、NOT、左移）在任务完成时间上具有统计显著性差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索位运算符在编程中的可读性和理解性差异，特别是针对不同编程背景的人群。

Method: 采用被试内实验设计，让23名不同编程背景的参与者完成JavaScript编程任务，记录任务完成时间和准确性。

Result: 运算符是预测响应时间的因素之一（R²=0.032，F(1,494)=16.5，p<.001），OR、NOT和左移运算符在任务完成时间上显示出统计显著性。

Conclusion: 虽然位运算符的复杂性并未普遍导致更长的任务完成时间，但某些运算符不够直观，需要进一步研究和改进设计以提高理解性。

Abstract: Objectives: This study aims to investigate the readability and
understandability of bitwise operators in programming, with the main hypothesis
that there will be a difference in the performance metrics (response time and
error rate) between participants exposed to various bitwise operators related
questions and those who are not.
  Participants: Participants in this human research study include people
without programming background, novice programmers, and university students
with varying programming experience (from freshmen to PhD level). There were 23
participants for this study.
  Study Methods: This study uses an Within-Subjects Experimental Design to
assess how people with diverse programming backgrounds understand and use
bitwise operators. Participants complete tasks in JavaScript program, and their
task completion time and accuracy of the tasks are recorded for analysis.
  Findings: The results indicate that operators can be one of the factors
predicting response time, with a small but significant effect, with R-squared
0.032, (1, 494) = 16.5, p < .001. Additionally, some operators like OR, NOT,
and Left Shift showed statistical significance in task completion times
compared to other operators.
  Conclusions: While the complexity of bitwise operators did not generally
result in longer task completion times, certain operators were found to be less
intuitive, suggesting the need for further investigation and potential redesign
for improved understandability.

TL;DR: Jaralyzer是一个基于字节码分析的Java依赖扫描器，能够有效检测修改后的开源依赖中的安全漏洞，优于现有扫描工具。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代Java项目中71%的代码来自开源依赖，存在严重的安全风险。现有依赖扫描器在处理重新编译、重新打包等依赖修改时存在不足。

Method: Jaralyzer直接分析依赖的字节码，不依赖元数据或源代码，能够处理各种依赖修改情况。

Result: 在56个流行OSS组件评估中，Jaralyzer在检测修改依赖中的漏洞方面优于其他扫描器，是唯一能识别所有类型修改中漏洞的工具。在未修改依赖中，比Eclipse Steady多检测28个真实漏洞，减少29个误报。

Conclusion: 字节码中心的方法能有效解决依赖扫描中的挑战，特别是在处理修改依赖时表现优异。

Abstract: On average, 71% of the code in typical Java projects comes from open-source
software (OSS) dependencies, making OSS dependencies the dominant component of
modern software code bases. This high degree of OSS reliance comes with a
considerable security risk of adding known security vulnerabilities to a code
base. To remedy this risk, researchers and companies have developed various
dependency scanners, which try to identify inclusions of known-to-be-vulnerable
OSS dependencies. However, there are still challenges that modern dependency
scanners do not overcome, especially when it comes to dependency modifications,
such as re-compilations, re-bundlings or re-packagings, which are common in the
Java ecosystem. To overcome these challenges, we present Jaralyzer, a
bytecode-centric dependency scanner for Java. Jaralyzer does not rely on the
metadata or the source code of the included OSS dependencies being available
but directly analyzes a dependency's bytecode. Our evaluation across 56 popular
OSS components demonstrates that Jaralyzer outperforms other popular dependency
scanners in detecting vulnerabilities within modified dependencies. It is the
only scanner capable of identifying vulnerabilities across all the above
mentioned types of modifications. But even when applied to unmodified
dependencies, Jaralyzer outperforms the current state-of-the-art code-centric
scanner Eclipse Steady by detecting 28 more true vulnerabilities and yielding
29 fewer false warnings.

TL;DR: AutoMT是一个基于大语言模型的多代理框架，用于自动驾驶系统的蜕变测试，能够自动从交通规则中提取蜕变关系并生成有效的后续测试用例，显著提高了测试多样性和故障检测能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶系统是安全关键系统，故障后果严重。现有的蜕变测试方法依赖大量人工工作且缺乏自动化，需要一种能够自动提取蜕变关系并生成测试用例的解决方案。

Method: 使用LLM从Gherkin语法的交通规则中提取蜕变关系，通过视觉语言代理分析场景，搜索代理从RAG数据库中检索合适的蜕变关系，利用计算机视觉生成后续测试用例。

Result: AutoMT在后续用例生成中实现了比最佳基线（手动专家定义的蜕变关系）高5倍的测试多样性，检测到多20.55%的行为违规。

Conclusion: AutoMT能够自动提取多样化的蜕变关系，增强真实世界数据集，发现现场测试和数据收集中常被遗漏的边界情况。其模块化架构支持集成到工业流水线中，并可能实现基于仿真的测试来系统覆盖代表性不足或安全关键的场景。

Abstract: Autonomous Driving Systems (ADS) are safety-critical, where failures can be
severe. While Metamorphic Testing (MT) is effective for fault detection in ADS,
existing methods rely heavily on manual effort and lack automation. We present
AutoMT, a multi-agent MT framework powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) that
automates the extraction of Metamorphic Relations (MRs) from local traffic
rules and the generation of valid follow-up test cases. AutoMT leverages LLMs
to extract MRs from traffic rules in Gherkin syntax using a predefined
ontology. A vision-language agent analyzes scenarios, and a search agent
retrieves suitable MRs from a RAG-based database to generate follow-up cases
via computer vision. Experiments show that AutoMT achieves up to 5 x higher
test diversity in follow-up case generation compared to the best baseline
(manual expert-defined MRs) in terms of validation rate, and detects up to
20.55% more behavioral violations. While manual MT relies on a fixed set of
predefined rules, AutoMT automatically extracts diverse metamorphic relations
that augment real-world datasets and help uncover corner cases often missed
during in-field testing and data collection. Its modular architecture
separating MR extraction, filtering, and test generation supports integration
into industrial pipelines and potentially enables simulation-based testing to
systematically cover underrepresented or safety-critical scenarios.

Abstract: The ongoing transformation of the European energy landscape, driven by the
integration of renewable energy sources, digital technologies, and
decentralized systems, requires a high degree of interoperability across
diverse components and systems. Ensuring that these elements can exchange
information and operate together reliably is essential for achieving a secure,
flexible, and efficient energy supply infrastructure. While several initiatives
have contributed to the development of smart grid testing infrastructures, they
do not provide a dedicated or comprehensive focus on interoperability testing.
A structured and harmonized overview of interoperability testing capabilities
across Europe is therefore still missing. This work therefore presents a novel
contribution by analyzing the European interoperability testing facility
landscape through a structured survey of 30 facilities. It provides a
categorized inventory of testing infrastructures, applied methodologies, and
reference test cases, and introduces a blueprint for the development of future
testing environments. The findings contribute to the establishment of a
coordinated European ecosystem for interoperability testing, supporting
collaboration, innovation, and alignment with the goals of the energy
transition.

Abstract: Root Cause Analysis (RCA) is a crucial aspect of incident management in
large-scale cloud services. While the term root cause analysis or RCA has been
widely used, different studies formulate the task differently. This is because
the term "RCA" implicitly covers tasks with distinct underlying goals. For
instance, the goal of localizing a faulty service for rapid triage is
fundamentally different from identifying a specific functional bug for a
definitive fix. However, previous surveys have largely overlooked these
goal-based distinctions, conventionally categorizing papers by input data types
(e.g., metric-based vs. trace-based methods). This leads to the grouping of
works with disparate objectives, thereby obscuring the true progress and gaps
in the field. Meanwhile, the typical audience of an RCA survey is either laymen
who want to know the goals and big picture of the task or RCA researchers who
want to figure out past research under the same task formulation. Thus, an RCA
survey that organizes the related papers according to their goals is in high
demand. To this end, this paper presents a goal-driven framework that
effectively categorizes and integrates 135 papers on RCA in the context of
cloud incident management based on their diverse goals, spanning the period
from 2014 to 2025. In addition to the goal-driven categorization, it discusses
the ultimate goal of all RCA papers as an umbrella covering different RCA
formulations. Moreover, the paper discusses open challenges and future
directions in RCA.

Conclusion: AutoPage将系统从单纯工具转变为强大的协作助手，通过分层协作流程和防幻觉机制成功解决了论文到网页的自动化转换问题。

Abstract: In the quest for scientific progress, communicating research is as vital as
the discovery itself. Yet, researchers are often sidetracked by the manual,
repetitive chore of building project webpages to make their dense papers
accessible. While automation has tackled static slides and posters, the
dynamic, interactive nature of webpages has remained an unaddressed challenge.
To bridge this gap, we reframe the problem, arguing that the solution lies not
in a single command, but in a collaborative, hierarchical process. We introduce
$\textbf{AutoPage}$, a novel multi-agent system that embodies this philosophy.
AutoPage deconstructs paper-to-page creation into a coarse-to-fine pipeline
from narrative planning to multimodal content generation and interactive
rendering. To combat AI hallucination, dedicated "Checker" agents verify each
step against the source paper, while optional human checkpoints ensure the
final product aligns perfectly with the author's vision, transforming the
system from a mere tool into a powerful collaborative assistant. To rigorously
validate our approach, we also construct $\textbf{PageBench}$, the first
benchmark for this new task. Experiments show AutoPage not only generates
high-quality, visually appealing pages but does so with remarkable efficiency
in under 15 minutes for less than \$0.1. Code and dataset will be released at
$\href{https://mqleet.github.io/AutoPage_ProjectPage/}{Webpage}$.

Conclusion: FidelityGPT在准确性和可读性方面取得显著提升，展示了其在基于LLM的反编译和逆向工程中的潜力。

Abstract: Decompilation converts machine code into human-readable form, enabling
analysis and debugging without source code. However, fidelity issues often
degrade the readability and semantic accuracy of decompiled output. Existing
methods, such as variable renaming or structural simplification, provide
partial improvements but lack robust detection and correction, particularly for
complex closed-source binaries. We present FidelityGPT, a framework that
enhances decompiled code accuracy and readability by systematically detecting
and correcting semantic distortions. FidelityGPT introduces distortion-aware
prompt templates tailored to closed-source settings and integrates
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with a dynamic semantic intensity
algorithm to locate distorted lines and retrieve semantically similar code from
a database. A variable dependency algorithm further mitigates long-context
limitations by analyzing redundant variables and integrating their dependencies
into the prompt context. Evaluated on 620 function pairs from a binary
similarity benchmark, FidelityGPT achieved an average detection accuracy of 89%
and a precision of 83%. Compared to the state-of-the-art DeGPT (Fix Rate 83%,
Corrected Fix Rate 37%), FidelityGPT attained 94% FR and 64% CFR, demonstrating
significant gains in accuracy and readability. These results highlight its
potential to advance LLM-based decompilation and reverse engineering.

Abstract: Agentic AI is poised to usher in a seismic paradigm shift in Software
Engineering (SE). As technologists rush head-along to make agentic AI a
reality, SE researchers are driven to establish agentic SE as a research area.
While early visions of agentic SE are primarily focused on code-related
activities, early empirical evidence calls for a consideration of a range of
socio-technical concerns to make it work in practice. This paper contributes to
the emerging community vision by: (a) recommending an expansion of its scope
beyond code, toward a 'whole of process' vision, grounding it in SE foundations
and evolution and emerging agentic SE frameworks, (b) proposing a preliminary
set of values and principles to guide efforts, and (c) sharing guidance on
designing/using well-defined vocabulary for agentic SE. It is hoped that these
ideas will encourage community collaborations and steer the SE community
towards laying strong foundations of agentic SE so its not only inevitable but
also deliberate and desirable in the long run.

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are transforming software creation by enabling
zero code development platforms. Our survey reviews recent platforms that let
users build applications without writing code, by leveraging LLMs as the brains
of the development process. We adopt a broad survey methodology, categorizing
platforms based on key dimensions such as interface style, backend integration,
output type, and extensibility. We analyze both dedicated LLM based app
builders (OpenAI's custom GPTs, Bolt.new, Dust.tt, Flowise, Cognosys) and
general no code platforms (e.g., Bubble, Glide) that integrate LLM
capabilities. We present a taxonomy categorizing these platforms by their
interface (conversational, visual, etc.), supported LLM backends, output type
(chatbot, full application, workflow), and degree of extensibility. Core
features such as autonomous agents, memory management, workflow orchestration,
and API integrations are in scope of the survey. We provide a detailed
comparison, highlighting each platform's strengths and limitations. Trade offs
(customizability, scalability, vendor lock-in) are discussed in comparison with
traditional and low code development approaches. Finally, we outline future
directions, including multimodal interfaces, on device LLMs, and improved
orchestration for democratizing app creation with AI. Our findings indicate
that while zero code LLM platforms greatly reduce the barrier to creating AI
powered applications, they still face challenges in flexibility and
reliability. Overall, the landscape is rapidly evolving, offering exciting
opportunities to empower non programmers to create sophisticated software.

*S M Sadrul Islam Asif,James Chen,Earl T. Barr,Mark Marron*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: BOSQTGEN是一种新颖的黑盒API测试生成方法，通过分解API规范、使用LLM生成连贯参数值、组合测试来高效采样，解决了多语言系统、源代码不可访问、成本可靠性权衡和结构化输入生成等挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代软件越来越多地通过组合API构建，API合约变得至关重要。不充分的合约会导致期望不匹配和故障，迫切需要强大的符合性测试。现有测试生成技术面临多语言系统、源代码不可访问、成本可靠性权衡以及结构化输入生成困难等挑战。

Method: BOSQTGEN采用黑盒方法，将API规范分解为原始参数，使用LLM建议连贯的参数值，并应用组合测试在这些值上进行高效采样。这种方法确保覆盖关键交互，同时避免随机采样的冗余。

Result: BOSQTGEN在RESTful基准测试中平均达到82%的代码覆盖率，通常比先前最先进系统提高20%或更多，接近手写测试套件的水平。

Conclusion: BOSQTGEN提供完全基于API的测试生成方法，使开发人员能够自动创建高质量的测试用例，用于验证或测试驱动开发。

Abstract: Modern software is increasingly built by composing APIs, elevating the API
contract to a critical role. Inadequate contracts, however, lead to mismatched
expectations and failures, creating a pressing need for robust conformance
testing. Current test generation techniques are hindered by key challenges:
polyglot systems, source code inaccessibility, a cost-reliability trade-off,
and, most critically, the difficulty of generating structured inputs.
  We introduce BOSQTGEN, a novel black-box methodology and tool for API test
generation. BOSQTGEN utilizes a novel approach for decomposing API
specifications into primitives, using LLMs to suggest coherent strata for them,
and employing combinatorial testing to efficiently sample over these values.
This approach ensures coverage of critical interactions while avoiding the
redundancy of random sampling.
  The resulting BOSQTGEN system achieves an average of 82% code coverage on
RESTful benchmarks, often a 20% or more increase over prior state-of-the-art
systems and nearing parity with hand-written test suites. Providing a fully
API-driven approach to test generation, enables developers to automatically
create high-quality test cases for validation or test-driven development.

*Hongjun Liu,Leyu Zhou,Zijianghao Yang,Chao Yao*

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: SRGDiff是一个用于EEG空间超分辨率的步感知残差引导扩散模型，通过动态条件生成从低密度EEG信号恢复高密度信号，解决了分布偏移和信号失真问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 轻量级EEG系统虽然成本效益好，但空间稀疏性限制了空间保真度，影响学习效果并引入偏差。现有的EEG空间超分辨率方法受限于分布偏移和信号失真，降低了EEG分析和可视化的可用性。

Method: 提出SRGDiff模型，学习从低密度输入中提取动态残差条件，预测逐步的时间和空间细节，通过加性融合和步相关仿射调制来引导去噪过程，实现高密度重建。

Result: 在SEED、SEED-IV和Localize-MI数据集上的综合评估显示，SRGDiff相比强基线方法有高达40%的性能提升，在EEG空间超分辨率任务中表现优越。

Conclusion: SRGDiff通过动态残差引导机制有效缓解了低密度和高密度记录之间的空间-频谱偏移，在EEG空间超分辨率任务中实现了保真度和一致性的平衡。

Abstract: For real-world BCI applications, lightweight Electroencephalography (EEG)
systems offer the best cost-deployment balance. However, such spatial sparsity
of EEG limits spatial fidelity, hurting learning and introducing bias. EEG
spatial super-resolution methods aim to recover high-density EEG signals from
sparse measurements, yet is often hindered by distribution shift and signal
distortion and thus reducing fidelity and usability for EEG analysis and
visualization. To overcome these challenges, we introduce SRGDiff, a step-aware
residual-guided diffusion model that formulates EEG spatial super-resolution as
dynamic conditional generation. Our key idea is to learn a dynamic residual
condition from the low-density input that predicts the step-wise temporal and
spatial details to add and uses the evolving cue to steer the denoising process
toward high-density reconstructions. At each denoising step, the proposed
residual condition is additively fused with the previous denoiser feature maps,
then a step-dependent affine modulation scales and shifts the activation to
produce the current features. This iterative procedure dynamically extracts
step-wise temporal rhythms and spatial-topographic cues to steer high-density
recovery and maintain a fidelity-consistency balance. We adopt a comprehensive
evaluation protocol spanning signal-, feature-, and downstream-level metrics
across SEED, SEED-IV, and Localize-MI and multiple upsampling scales. SRGDiff
achieves consistent gains of up to 40% over strong baselines, proving its
superiority in the task of EEG spatial super-resolution. Moreover, topographic
visualizations comparison and substantial EEG-FID gains jointly indicate that
our SR EEG mitigates the spatial-spectral shift between low- and high-density
recordings.

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: CDI-DTI是一个新颖的跨域可解释药物-靶点相互作用预测框架，通过多模态特征融合和多源交叉注意力机制，在跨域泛化、冷启动预测和可解释性方面表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有药物-靶点相互作用预测方法在跨域泛化、冷启动预测和可解释性方面存在不足，需要开发能够同时解决这些挑战的新方法。

Method: 集成文本、结构和功能等多模态特征，采用多策略融合方法；引入多源交叉注意力机制进行特征对齐和早期融合；使用双向交叉注意力层捕获细粒度药物-靶点相互作用；结合Gram Loss进行特征对齐和深度正交融合模块消除冗余。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上的实验结果表明，CDI-DTI显著优于现有方法，特别是在跨域和冷启动任务中表现优异，同时保持高可解释性。

Conclusion: CDI-DTI框架有效解决了药物-靶点相互作用预测中的跨域泛化、冷启动和可解释性问题，为药物发现提供了实用的预测工具。

Abstract: Accurate prediction of drug-target interactions (DTI) is pivotal for drug
discovery, yet existing methods often fail to address challenges like
cross-domain generalization, cold-start prediction, and interpretability. In
this work, we propose CDI-DTI, a novel cross-domain interpretable framework for
DTI prediction, designed to overcome these limitations. By integrating
multi-modal features-textual, structural, and functional-through a
multi-strategy fusion approach, CDI-DTI ensures robust performance across
different domains and in cold-start scenarios. A multi-source cross-attention
mechanism is introduced to align and fuse features early, while a bidirectional
cross-attention layer captures fine-grained intra-modal drug-target
interactions. To enhance model interpretability, we incorporate Gram Loss for
feature alignment and a deep orthogonal fusion module to eliminate redundancy.
Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that CDI-DTI
significantly outperforms existing methods, particularly in cross-domain and
cold-start tasks, while maintaining high interpretability for practical
applications in drug-target interaction prediction.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个统一框架来分析测试时缩放中验证器的作用，将可验证测试时缩放建模为传输问题，揭示了次优性-覆盖率曲线的三个区域，并分析了顺序和批量采样算法的计算复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然带验证的测试时缩放显示出提升大语言模型性能的潜力，但验证器的作用及其不完美性仍未得到充分探索。现有研究仅捕捉了这些因素的部分子集，缺乏量化它们相互作用几何特性的统一框架。

Method: 将可验证测试时缩放建模为传输问题，通过分析生成器的覆盖率、验证器的收敛区域和采样算法的次优性这三个量的相互作用，提出了顺序和批量两类采样算法。

Result: 理论分析表明次优性-覆盖率曲线存在三个区域：传输区域（次优性随覆盖率增加）、策略改进区域（次优性可能随覆盖率减少，取决于验证器的收敛区域）和饱和区域（次优性趋于稳定）。实证结果与Qwen、Llama和Gemma模型的实验结果一致。

Conclusion: 通过传输问题框架揭示了验证器在测试时缩放中的关键作用，为理解覆盖率、验证器性能和采样算法之间的权衡提供了理论基础，并展示了不同采样算法对这些权衡的影响。

Abstract: While test-time scaling with verification has shown promise in improving the
performance of large language models (LLMs), the role of the verifier and its
imperfections remain underexplored. The effect of verification manifests
through interactions of three quantities: (i) the generator's coverage, (ii)
the verifier's region of convergence (ROC), and (iii) the sampling algorithm's
sub-optimality. Though recent studies capture subsets of these factors, a
unified framework quantifying the geometry of their interplay is missing. We
frame verifiable test-time scaling as a transport problem. This characterizes
the interaction of coverage, ROC, and sub-optimality, and uncovers that the
sub-optimality--coverage curve exhibits three regimes. A transport regime --
where sub-optimality increases with coverage, a policy improvement regime --
where sub-optimality may decrease with coverage, depending on the verifier's
ROC, and a saturation regime -- where sub-optimality plateaus, unaffected by
coverage. We further propose and analyze two classes of sampling algorithms --
sequential and batched, and examine how their computational complexities shape
these trade-offs. Empirical results with Qwen, Llama, and Gemma models
corroborate our theoretical findings.

TL;DR: ACTMED是一个结合贝叶斯实验设计和大型语言模型的临床诊断框架，通过逐步选择能最大程度减少诊断不确定性的测试来优化诊断过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有机器学习诊断方法依赖静态数据集，无法模拟临床医生在实践中的顺序性、资源感知推理过程。诊断在高压或资源有限环境中仍然复杂且容易出错，需要能够帮助医生做出及时且成本效益高的决策的框架。

Method: ACTMED将贝叶斯实验设计与大型语言模型结合，在每个步骤中选择预期能为特定患者带来最大诊断不确定性减少的测试。LLM作为灵活模拟器，生成合理的患者状态分布并支持信念更新，无需结构化、特定任务的训练数据。

Result: 在真实世界数据集上的评估显示，ACTMED能够优化测试选择，提高诊断准确性、可解释性和资源利用效率。

Conclusion: ACTMED代表了向透明、自适应且与临床医生对齐的诊断系统迈出的一步，能够在减少对领域特定数据依赖的情况下跨环境泛化。

Abstract: There is growing interest in using machine learning (ML) to support clinical
diag- nosis, but most approaches rely on static, fully observed datasets and
fail to reflect the sequential, resource-aware reasoning clinicians use in
practice. Diagnosis remains complex and error prone, especially in
high-pressure or resource-limited settings, underscoring the need for
frameworks that help clinicians make timely and cost-effective decisions. We
propose ACTMED (Adaptive Clinical Test selection via Model-based Experimental
Design), a diagnostic framework that integrates Bayesian Experimental Design
(BED) with large language models (LLMs) to better emulate real-world diagnostic
reasoning. At each step, ACTMED selects the test expected to yield the greatest
reduction in diagnostic uncertainty for a given patient. LLMs act as flexible
simulators, generating plausible patient state distributions and supporting
belief updates without requiring structured, task-specific training data.
Clinicians can remain in the loop; reviewing test suggestions, interpreting
intermediate outputs, and applying clinical judgment throughout. We evaluate
ACTMED on real-world datasets and show it can optimize test selection to
improve diagnostic accuracy, interpretability, and resource use. This
represents a step to- ward transparent, adaptive, and clinician-aligned
diagnostic systems that generalize across settings with reduced reliance on
domain-specific data.

TL;DR: 提出PRISM方法，通过学习群不变核来缓解基于偏好的奖励模型中的捷径行为问题，提高奖励模型的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于人类反馈的奖励模型容易受到奖励攻击和泛化能力差的问题，模型会利用训练数据中的虚假特征（如回复长度、讨好语气等）来获取高奖励分数，而非真正反映人类意图。

Method: 受核视角下不变性理论启发，提出PRISM方法，通过闭式学习目标学习具有特征映射的群不变核，缓解捷径行为。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，该方法持续提高了奖励模型在多样化分布外任务上的准确性，并减少了下游策略模型对捷径的依赖。

Conclusion: PRISM为基于偏好的对齐建立了一个稳健的框架，能有效缓解奖励模型中的捷径行为问题。

Abstract: In reinforcement learning from human feedback, preference-based reward models
play a central role in aligning large language models to human-aligned
behavior. However, recent studies show that these models are prone to reward
hacking and often fail to generalize well due to over-optimization. They
achieve high reward scores by exploiting shortcuts, that is, exploiting
spurious features (e.g., response verbosity, agreeable tone, or sycophancy)
that correlate with human preference labels in the training data rather than
genuinely reflecting the intended objectives. In this paper, instead of probing
these issues one at a time, we take a broader view of the reward hacking
problem as shortcut behaviors and introduce a principled yet flexible approach
to mitigate shortcut behaviors in preference-based reward learning. Inspired by
the invariant theory in the kernel perspective, we propose Preference-based
Reward Invariance for Shortcut Mitigation (PRISM), which learns group-invariant
kernels with feature maps in a closed-form learning objective. Experimental
results in several benchmarks show that our method consistently improves the
accuracy of the reward model on diverse out-of-distribution tasks and reduces
the dependency on shortcuts in downstream policy models, establishing a robust
framework for preference-based alignment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前对多模态大语言模型音频理解能力的评估可能掩盖了其在关系推理方面的根本弱点，需要更系统的评估工具。

Method: 开发了MUSE基准测试，包含10个任务来探究基础音乐感知技能，评估了4个SOTA模型并与200人的人类基线进行对比。

Result: 发现SOTA模型能力差异很大，与人类专家存在持续差距；Gemini Pro在基础感知上表现良好，但Qwen和Audio Flamingo 3表现接近随机水平；思维链提示效果不一致且往往有害。

Conclusion: MUSE基准为评估不变音乐表示提供了关键工具，将推动开发更鲁棒的AI系统。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated capabilities in
audio understanding, but current evaluations may obscure fundamental weaknesses
in relational reasoning. We introduce the Music Understanding and Structural
Evaluation (MUSE) Benchmark, an open-source resource with 10 tasks designed to
probe fundamental music perception skills. We evaluate four SOTA models (Gemini
Pro and Flash, Qwen2.5-Omni, and Audio-Flamingo 3) against a large human
baseline (N=200). Our results reveal a wide variance in SOTA capabilities and a
persistent gap with human experts. While Gemini Pro succeeds on basic
perception, Qwen and Audio Flamingo 3 perform at or near chance, exposing
severe perceptual deficits. Furthermore, we find Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
prompting provides inconsistent, often detrimental results. Our work provides a
critical tool for evaluating invariant musical representations and driving
development of more robust AI systems.

Motivation: 尽管大型语言模型在医疗领域快速扩张，但这些系统根据CONSORT标准评估临床试验报告的能力仍不清楚，特别是在认知和推理策略方面。

Method: 采用行为和元认知分析方法，使用专家验证的数据，在三种提示条件下系统比较了两个代表性的大型语言模型。

Result: 模型在处理不同CONSORT项目和提示类型时表现出明显差异，包括推理风格转变、明确的不确定性和替代解释等响应模式。

Conclusion: 结果突显了这些系统在临床合规自动化方面的当前局限性，并强调了理解其认知适应和策略行为对于开发更可解释和可靠的医疗AI的重要性。

Abstract: Despite the rapid expansion of Large Language Models (LLMs) in healthcare,
the ability of these systems to assess clinical trial reporting according to
CONSORT standards remains unclear, particularly with respect to their cognitive
and reasoning strategies. This study applies a behavioral and metacognitive
analytic approach with expert-validated data, systematically comparing two
representative LLMs under three prompt conditions. Clear differences emerged in
how the models approached various CONSORT items, and prompt types, including
shifts in reasoning style, explicit uncertainty, and alternative
interpretations shaped response patterns. Our results highlight the current
limitations of these systems in clinical compliance automation and underscore
the importance of understanding their cognitive adaptations and strategic
behavior in developing more explainable and reliable medical AI.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文研究了推理模型中的模式选择问题，将其识别为早期退出问题的更具挑战性变体，旨在通过零步思考在推理过程开始时自动选择长链思考或短链思考模式，以减少计算负担。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 推理模型在数学和逻辑推理任务中表现出色，但其逐步思考过程常导致过度思考，产生不必要的计算开销。为了解决这个问题，需要开发能够自动决定推理模式的方法。

Method: 将模式选择识别为早期退出问题的变体，比较了九种基线方法，包括基于提示的方法和利用模型内部信息的方法，重点关注在推理过程开始时基于预定义虚假思考进行决策的零步思考方法。

Result: 基于提示的方法由于分类能力有限且只能提供少量手工制作信息而经常失败；利用内部信息的方法在大多数情况下表现更好，但仍存在稳定性问题。现有方法仅依赖模型提供的信息不足以有效解决信息有限场景下的模式选择问题。

Conclusion: 模式选择是一个具有挑战性的任务，现有方法在信息有限场景下效果有限，突显了该任务的持续挑战性。

Abstract: Reasoning models have demonstrated exceptional performance in tasks such as
mathematics and logical reasoning, primarily due to their ability to engage in
step-by-step thinking during the reasoning process. However, this often leads
to overthinking, resulting in unnecessary computational overhead. To address
this issue, Mode Selection aims to automatically decide between Long-CoT
(Chain-of-Thought) or Short-CoT by utilizing either a Thinking or NoThinking
mode. Simultaneously, Early Exit determines the optimal stopping point during
the iterative reasoning process. Both methods seek to reduce the computational
burden. In this paper, we first identify Mode Selection as a more challenging
variant of the Early Exit problem, as they share similar objectives but differ
in decision timing. While Early Exit focuses on determining the best stopping
point for concise reasoning at inference time, Mode Selection must make this
decision at the beginning of the reasoning process, relying on pre-defined fake
thoughts without engaging in an explicit reasoning process, referred to as
zero-step thinking. Through empirical studies on nine baselines, we observe
that prompt-based approaches often fail due to their limited classification
capabilities when provided with minimal hand-crafted information. In contrast,
approaches that leverage internal information generally perform better across
most scenarios but still exhibit issues with stability. Our findings indicate
that existing methods relying solely on the information provided by models are
insufficient for effectively addressing Mode Selection in scenarios with
limited information, highlighting the ongoing challenges of this task. Our code

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前网页智能体评估主要依赖二元成功指标或单一参考轨迹，忽略了基准数据集中的结构多样性。

Method: 将多个智能体的轨迹抽象为统一的加权动作图，规范编码动作，合并重复行为，并应用结构分析包括奖励传播和成功加权边统计。

Result: 在数千个来自六个网页智能体的轨迹评估中，图抽象捕捉了跨模型规律性，突出了冗余和低效，识别了基于结果指标忽略的关键决策点。

Conclusion: 通过将网页交互框架化为图结构数据，WebGraphEval建立了多路径、跨智能体和效率感知的网页智能体评估通用方法。

Abstract: Current evaluation of web agents largely reduces to binary success metrics or
conformity to a single reference trajectory, ignoring the structural diversity
present in benchmark datasets. We present WebGraphEval, a framework that
abstracts trajectories from multiple agents into a unified, weighted action
graph. This representation is directly compatible with benchmarks such as
WebArena, leveraging leaderboard runs and newly collected trajectories without
modifying environments. The framework canonically encodes actions, merges
recurring behaviors, and applies structural analyses including reward
propagation and success-weighted edge statistics. Evaluations across thousands
of trajectories from six web agents show that the graph abstraction captures
cross-model regularities, highlights redundancy and inefficiency, and
identifies critical decision points overlooked by outcome-based metrics. By
framing web interaction as graph-structured data, WebGraphEval establishes a
general methodology for multi-path, cross-agent, and efficiency-aware
evaluation of web agents.

Motivation: 评估ChatGPT在法律领域处理复杂任务的能力，特别是提取法律原则关键段落的任务，以揭示人工智能在综合推理方面的局限性。

Method: 在法律领域进行实验，将ChatGPT的表现与基于正则表达式的基线方法进行比较，分析其在知识整合和推理过程中的能力。

Result: ChatGPT无法有效整合所需知识和能力进行推理，无法提供全面解决方案，在法律原则提取任务中表现不如预期。

Conclusion: 真正的智能仍然是人类独有的特质，至少在法律领域，人工智能缺乏全面理解和推理能力，存在固有局限性。

Abstract: This study examines the performance of ChatGPT with an experiment in the
legal domain. We compare the outcome with it a baseline using regular
expressions (Regex), rather than focusing solely on the assessment against
human performance. The study reveals that even if ChatGPT has access to the
necessary knowledge and competencies, it is unable to assemble them, reason
through, in a way that leads to an exhaustive result. This unveils a major
limitation of ChatGPT. Intelligence encompasses the ability to break down
complex issues and address them according to multiple required competencies,
providing a unified and comprehensive solution. In the legal domain, one of the
most crucial tasks is reading legal decisions and extracting key passages
condensed from principles of law (PoLs), which are then incorporated into
subsequent rulings by judges or defense documents by lawyers. In performing
this task, artificial intelligence lacks an all-encompassing understanding and
reasoning, which makes it inherently limited. Genuine intelligence, remains a
uniquely human trait, at least in this particular field.

Method: 扩展推导状态论证框架（DSA-framework），以解释基于广义推理模型的推理过程。

Result: 开发了一个能够解释广义推理模型中推理的论证框架扩展。

Conclusion: 成功扩展了DSA框架，为容纳不一致先例的广义推理模型提供了论证性解释能力。

Abstract: Precedential constraint is one foundation of case-based reasoning in AI and
Law. It generally assumes that the underlying set of precedents must be
consistent. To relax this assumption, a generalized notion of the reason model
has been introduced. While several argumentative explanation approaches exist
for reasoning with precedents based on the traditional consistent reason model,
there has been no corresponding argumentative explanation method developed for
this generalized reasoning framework accommodating inconsistent precedents. To
address this question, this paper examines an extension of the derivation state
argumentation framework (DSA-framework) to explain the reasoning according to
the generalized notion of the reason model.

*Philipp J. Schneider,Lin Tian,Marian-Andrei Rizoiu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一个多智能体LLM模拟框架，通过行为奖励函数和情境学习来研究LLM智能体是否能重现人类在线社交动态，包括同质性、互惠性和社会验证等特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大型语言模型智能体是否能重现人类在线行为的复杂社交动态，以及什么记忆和学习机制能够促成这种动态的出现。

Method: 设计了一个多智能体LLM模拟框架，智能体通过情境学习和教练信号不断互动、相互评估并调整行为，使用行为奖励函数捕捉在线参与的核心驱动因素。

Result: 实验显示，经过教练的LLM智能体能够发展出稳定的互动模式并形成新兴的社交联系，产生的网络结构反映了真实在线社区的特性。

Conclusion: 该框架为研究LLM群体中的集体动态建立了原则性测试平台，揭示了人工智能智能体如何近似或偏离人类社交行为。

Abstract: Can large language model (LLM) agents reproduce the complex social dynamics
that characterize human online behavior -- shaped by homophily, reciprocity,
and social validation -- and what memory and learning mechanisms enable such
dynamics to emerge? We present a multi-agent LLM simulation framework in which
agents repeatedly interact, evaluate one another, and adapt their behavior
through in-context learning accelerated by a coaching signal. To model human
social behavior, we design behavioral reward functions that capture core
drivers of online engagement, including social interaction, information
seeking, self-presentation, coordination, and emotional support. These rewards
align agent objectives with empirically observed user motivations, enabling the
study of how network structures and group formations emerge from individual
decision-making. Our experiments show that coached LLM agents develop stable
interaction patterns and form emergent social ties, yielding network structures
that mirror properties of real online communities. By combining behavioral
rewards with in-context adaptation, our framework establishes a principled
testbed for investigating collective dynamics in LLM populations and reveals
how artificial agents may approximate or diverge from human-like social
behavior.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了CKA-RL方法，通过持续知识适应策略和自适应知识合并机制，解决持续强化学习中的灾难性遗忘和知识利用效率问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实环境通常是非平稳的，需要智能体持续适应新任务和变化条件。现有持续强化学习方法存在灾难性遗忘和知识利用效率低的问题。

Method: CKA-RL包含持续知识适应策略（维护任务特定知识向量池并动态使用历史知识）和自适应知识合并机制（合并相似知识向量以减少内存需求）。

Result: 在三个基准测试中，CKA-RL优于现有最优方法，整体性能提升4.20%，前向迁移提升8.02%。

Conclusion: CKA-RL通过有效积累和利用历史知识，显著提升了持续强化学习的性能，解决了灾难性遗忘和知识迁移效率问题。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning enables agents to learn optimal behaviors through
interactions with environments. However, real-world environments are typically
non-stationary, requiring agents to continuously adapt to new tasks and
changing conditions. Although Continual Reinforcement Learning facilitates
learning across multiple tasks, existing methods often suffer from catastrophic
forgetting and inefficient knowledge utilization. To address these challenges,
we propose Continual Knowledge Adaptation for Reinforcement Learning (CKA-RL),
which enables the accumulation and effective utilization of historical
knowledge. Specifically, we introduce a Continual Knowledge Adaptation
strategy, which involves maintaining a task-specific knowledge vector pool and
dynamically using historical knowledge to adapt the agent to new tasks. This
process mitigates catastrophic forgetting and enables efficient knowledge
transfer across tasks by preserving and adapting critical model parameters.
Additionally, we propose an Adaptive Knowledge Merging mechanism that combines
similar knowledge vectors to address scalability challenges, reducing memory
requirements while ensuring the retention of essential knowledge. Experiments
on three benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed CKA-RL outperforms
state-of-the-art methods, achieving an improvement of 4.20% in overall
performance and 8.02% in forward transfer. The source code is available at

*Jia-Kai Dong,I-Wei Huang,Chun-Tin Wu,Yi-Tien Tsai*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MSC-Bench是一个用于评估LLM代理在多跳、端到端工具编排能力的大规模基准测试，通过五级课程设计系统性测试从单工具编排到跨服务器规划的代理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试往往孤立评估工具，忽略了功能重叠和跨服务器编排等挑战，导致评估过于乐观。MSC-Bench旨在填补这些空白。

Method: 通过构建'等效功能集'作为真实基准，使用客观指标如F1分数，减少对LLM作为评判的依赖，采用五级课程设计系统测试代理能力。

Result: 实验表明刚性层次结构会阻碍性能，即使最先进的代理在鲁棒性方面也存在系统性弱点。

Conclusion: MSC-Bench提供了一个诊断框架来暴露这些限制，并指导开发更强大、高效的工具使用代理。

Abstract: We introduce MSC-Bench, a large-scale benchmark for evaluating multi-hop,
end-to-end tool orchestration by LLM agents in a hierarchical Model-Context
Protocol (MCP) ecosystem. Existing benchmarks often evaluate tools in
isolation, ignoring challenges such as functional overlap and cross-server
orchestration, leading to overly optimistic assessments. MSC-Bench addresses
these gaps by constructing ground truth through 'equal function sets', allowing
objective metrics such as F1 score and reducing the dependency on
LLM-as-a-judge evaluation. Organized as a five-level curriculum, it
systematically tests agent capabilities from single-tool orchestration to
complex cross-server planning, and robustness to out-of-scope requests.
Experiments reveal that rigid hierarchies can hinder performance without
co-designed strategies, and even state-of-the-art agents exhibit systemic
weaknesses in robustness. MSC-Bench provides a diagnostic framework to expose
these limitations and guide the development of more capable and efficient
tool-using agents. The benchmark and resources are publicly available at
https://github.com/snooow1029/MSC_Bench.

*Wonje Choi,Jooyoung Kim,Honguk Woo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: NeSyPr是一个神经符号程序化框架，将符号规划转化为可组合的程序表示，使语言模型能够在资源受限的物理系统中进行高效推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在动态环境中使用语言模型进行具身任务时的延迟、连接性和资源限制问题，避免对大规模推理引擎或符号规划器的在线依赖。

Method: 首先使用符号工具生成任务特定计划，然后将这些计划转化为编码隐式产生规则的可组合程序表示，最终将这些程序无缝集成到语言模型的推理过程中。

Result: 在PDDLGym、VirtualHome和ALFWorld等具身基准测试中，NeSyPr展示了比大规模推理模型和符号规划器更高效的推理能力，同时使用更紧凑的语言模型。

Conclusion: 神经符号程序化能够将多步符号结构化路径查找和推理抽象为单步语言模型推理，适合在延迟敏感和资源受限的物理系统中部署。

Abstract: We address the challenge of adopting language models (LMs) for embodied tasks
in dynamic environments, where online access to large-scale inference engines
or symbolic planners is constrained due to latency, connectivity, and resource
limitations. To this end, we present NeSyPr, a novel embodied reasoning
framework that compiles knowledge via neurosymbolic proceduralization, thereby
equipping LM-based agents with structured, adaptive, and timely reasoning
capabilities. In NeSyPr, task-specific plans are first explicitly generated by
a symbolic tool leveraging its declarative knowledge. These plans are then
transformed into composable procedural representations that encode the plans'
implicit production rules, enabling the resulting composed procedures to be
seamlessly integrated into the LM's inference process. This neurosymbolic
proceduralization abstracts and generalizes multi-step symbolic structured
path-finding and reasoning into single-step LM inference, akin to human
knowledge compilation. It supports efficient test-time inference without
relying on external symbolic guidance, making it well suited for deployment in
latency-sensitive and resource-constrained physical systems. We evaluate NeSyPr
on the embodied benchmarks PDDLGym, VirtualHome, and ALFWorld, demonstrating
its efficient reasoning capabilities over large-scale reasoning models and a
symbolic planner, while using more compact LMs.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出DAIL方法解决语言指令模糊性问题，通过分布策略和语义对齐提升智能体对自然语言指令的理解和跟随能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自然语言指令的灵活性导致任务间存在严重模糊性，严重影响算法性能。

Method: DAIL方法包含两个关键组件：分布策略和语义对齐模块。分布策略通过值分布估计机制增强任务可区分性，语义对齐模块捕捉轨迹与语言指令之间的对应关系。

Result: 在结构化和视觉观察基准测试上的广泛实验结果表明，DAIL有效解决了指令模糊性问题，性能优于基线方法。

Conclusion: DAIL方法通过分布对齐学习有效提升了智能体对语言指令的理解和执行能力。

Abstract: Comprehending natural language and following human instructions are critical
capabilities for intelligent agents. However, the flexibility of linguistic
instructions induces substantial ambiguity across language-conditioned tasks,
severely degrading algorithmic performance. To address these limitations, we
present a novel method named DAIL (Distributional Aligned Learning), featuring
two key components: distributional policy and semantic alignment. Specifically,
we provide theoretical results that the value distribution estimation mechanism
enhances task differentiability. Meanwhile, the semantic alignment module
captures the correspondence between trajectories and linguistic instructions.
Extensive experimental results on both structured and visual observation
benchmarks demonstrate that DAIL effectively resolves instruction ambiguities,
achieving superior performance to baseline methods. Our implementation is
available at https://github.com/RunpengXie/Distributional-Aligned-Learning.

### [197] [HSCodeComp: A Realistic and Expert-level Benchmark for Deep Search Agents in Hierarchical Rule Application](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19631)
*Yiqian Yang,Tian Lan,Qianghuai Jia,Li Zhu,Hui Jiang,Hang Zhu,Longyue Wang,Weihua Luo,Kaifu Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HSCodeComp是首个评估深度搜索代理在分层规则应用能力的电商基准测试，要求代理根据产品描述预测10位协调制度编码，结果显示最佳代理准确率仅46.8%，远低于人类专家的95.0%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前代理基准测试忽视了深度搜索代理应用复杂规则（如法律条款、医疗手册和关税规则）的关键能力，这些规则具有模糊边界和隐式逻辑关系，应用难度大。

Method: 从大型电商平台收集真实数据构建HSCodeComp基准，包含632个产品条目，涵盖多样化产品类别，所有协调制度编码由多位人类专家标注。

Result: 在多个最先进LLM、开源和闭源代理上的实验结果显示巨大性能差距：最佳代理仅达到46.8%的10位准确率，远低于人类专家的95.0%，且测试时扩展无法进一步提升性能。

Conclusion: 分层规则应用对当前代理具有挑战性，HSCodeComp基准填补了代理评估的重要空白，揭示了现有代理在复杂规则应用方面的局限性。

Abstract: Effective deep search agents must not only access open-domain and
domain-specific knowledge but also apply complex rules-such as legal clauses,
medical manuals and tariff rules. These rules often feature vague boundaries
and implicit logic relationships, making precise application challenging for
agents. However, this critical capability is largely overlooked by current
agent benchmarks.
  To fill this gap, we introduce HSCodeComp, the first realistic, expert-level
e-commerce benchmark designed to evaluate deep search agents in hierarchical
rule application. In this task, the deep reasoning process of agents is guided
by these rules to predict 10-digit Harmonized System Code (HSCode) of products
with noisy but realistic descriptions. These codes, established by the World
Customs Organization, are vital for global supply chain efficiency. Built from
real-world data collected from large-scale e-commerce platforms, our proposed
HSCodeComp comprises 632 product entries spanning diverse product categories,
with these HSCodes annotated by several human experts.
  Extensive experimental results on several state-of-the-art LLMs, open-source,
and closed-source agents reveal a huge performance gap: best agent achieves
only 46.8% 10-digit accuracy, far below human experts at 95.0%. Besides,
detailed analysis demonstrates the challenges of hierarchical rule application,
and test-time scaling fails to improve performance further.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AgentSense是一个基于多智能体进化系统的混合训练免费框架，将大语言模型集成到参与式城市感知中，通过迭代优化提升适应性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有城市感知系统在多样化城市场景中泛化能力有限，决策过程缺乏可解释性，需要开发更适应动态城市条件和异构工作者偏好的解决方案。

Method: 结合经典规划器生成基准解决方案，通过多智能体进化系统迭代优化，使感知任务分配适应动态城市条件和异构工作者偏好，并生成自然语言解释。

Result: 在两个大规模移动数据集和七种动态干扰类型上的实验表明，AgentSense在适应性和可解释性方面优于传统方法，相比单智能体LLM基线在性能和鲁棒性上表现更好。

Conclusion: AgentSense代表了向部署自适应和可解释城市感知系统的重要进展，为基于Web的城市管理提供了更透明和可信的解决方案。

Abstract: Web-based participatory urban sensing has emerged as a vital approach for
modern urban management by leveraging mobile individuals as distributed
sensors. However, existing urban sensing systems struggle with limited
generalization across diverse urban scenarios and poor interpretability in
decision-making. In this work, we introduce AgentSense, a hybrid, training-free
framework that integrates large language models (LLMs) into participatory urban
sensing through a multi-agent evolution system. AgentSense initially employs
classical planner to generate baseline solutions and then iteratively refines
them to adapt sensing task assignments to dynamic urban conditions and
heterogeneous worker preferences, while producing natural language explanations
that enhance transparency and trust. Extensive experiments across two
large-scale mobility datasets and seven types of dynamic disturbances
demonstrate that AgentSense offers distinct advantages in adaptivity and
explainability over traditional methods. Furthermore, compared to single-agent
LLM baselines, our approach outperforms in both performance and robustness,
while delivering more reasonable and transparent explanations. These results
position AgentSense as a significant advancement towards deploying adaptive and
explainable urban sensing systems on the web.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 和弦音即兴演奏是爵士吉他理论的基础练习，但学习和练习难度较大，需要系统化的工具来帮助学生掌握这一技能。

Method: 首先生成和弦音琶音，构建加权图（节点代表和弦琶音，边权重基于最优过渡音计算），然后寻找图中的最短路径来重构和弦音独奏线条。

Result: 开发了一个用户友好的系统，能够处理输入输出，为吉他学生提供可练习的和弦音即兴演奏建议。

Conclusion: 该基于图的引擎为吉他学生提供了一种系统化的方法来学习和练习和弦音即兴演奏，有助于掌握这一重要的爵士吉他基础技能。

Abstract: We present a graph-based engine for computing chord tone soloing suggestions
for guitar students. Chord tone soloing is a fundamental practice for
improvising over a chord progression, where the instrumentalist uses only the
notes contained in the current chord. This practice is a building block for all
advanced jazz guitar theory but is difficult to learn and practice. First, we
discuss methods for generating chord-tone arpeggios. Next, we construct a
weighted graph where each node represents a chord tone arpeggio for a chord in
the progression. Then, we calculate the edge weight between each consecutive
chord's nodes in terms of optimal transition tones. We then find the shortest
path through this graph and reconstruct a chord-tone soloing line. Finally, we
discuss a user-friendly system to handle input and output to this engine for
guitar students to practice chord tone soloing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电子竞技观众和玩家数量增长，加上通信技术和云计算发展，推动了在线游戏行业增长。现有AI解决方案主要关注批量分类，忽视了可视化技术和流式处理。

Method: 采用可解释的赢预测分类解决方案，在流式处理中使用多个滑动窗口控制输入数据，以反映相关游戏变化。

Result: 实验结果显示准确率超过90%，超越了文献中的竞争解决方案。

Conclusion: 该系统可被排名和推荐系统利用进行明智决策，可解释性模块增强了对预测结果的信任。

Abstract: The increasing number of spectators and players in e-sports, along with the
development of optimized communication solutions and cloud computing
technology, has motivated the constant growth of the online game industry. Even
though Artificial Intelligence-based solutions for e-sports analytics are
traditionally defined as extracting meaningful patterns from related data and
visualizing them to enhance decision-making, most of the effort in professional
winning prediction has been focused on the classification aspect from a batch
perspective, also leaving aside the visualization techniques. Consequently,
this work contributes to an explainable win prediction classification solution
in streaming in which input data is controlled over several sliding windows to
reflect relevant game changes. Experimental results attained an accuracy higher
than 90 %, surpassing the performance of competing solutions in the literature.
Ultimately, our system can be leveraged by ranking and recommender systems for
informed decision-making, thanks to the explainability module, which fosters
trust in the outcome predictions.

*Yang Yang,Hua XU,Zhangyi Hu,Yutao Yue*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RLIE是一个将大型语言模型与概率建模相结合的统一框架，用于学习加权规则集，通过四个阶段实现：规则生成、逻辑回归学习权重、迭代优化和评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的方法忽略了规则间的相互作用，且未充分利用LLM与概率规则学习结合进行稳健推理的潜力。

Method: 四阶段框架：1) LLM生成和筛选候选规则；2) 逻辑回归学习概率权重；3) 基于预测误差迭代优化规则集；4) 评估加权规则集作为直接分类器的效果。

Result: 直接使用学习到的权重应用规则可获得优越性能，而将规则、权重和逻辑模型输出注入LLM反而会降低准确性。

Conclusion: LLM擅长语义生成和解释，但在精确概率集成方面可靠性较低。RLIE阐明了LLM在归纳推理中的潜力和局限性，并将其与经典概率规则组合方法结合以实现更可靠的神经符号推理。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can propose rules in natural language,
sidestepping the need for a predefined predicate space in traditional rule
learning. Yet many LLM-based approaches ignore interactions among rules, and
the opportunity to couple LLMs with probabilistic rule learning for robust
inference remains underexplored. We present RLIE, a unified framework that
integrates LLMs with probabilistic modeling to learn a set of weighted rules.
RLIE has four stages: (1) Rule generation, where an LLM proposes and filters
candidates; (2) Logistic regression, which learns probabilistic weights for
global selection and calibration; (3) Iterative refinement, which updates the
rule set using prediction errors; and (4) Evaluation, which compares the
weighted rule set as a direct classifier with methods that inject rules into an
LLM. We evaluate multiple inference strategies on real-world datasets. Applying
rules directly with their learned weights yields superior performance, whereas
prompting LLMs with the rules, weights, and logistic-model outputs surprisingly
degrades accuracy. This supports the view that LLMs excel at semantic
generation and interpretation but are less reliable for precise probabilistic
integration. RLIE clarifies the potential and limitations of LLMs for inductive
reasoning and couples them with classic probabilistic rule combination methods
to enable more reliable neuro-symbolic reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 形式化模型对于指定大型复杂计算机系统及其正确性验证至关重要，但编写和维护成本高昂。现有AI方法主要针对小规模代码，不清楚AI是否能处理现实系统组件并将其复杂行为属性抽象为形式化模型。

Method: 开发SysMoBench基准测试，专注于并发和分布式系统，使用TLA+规范语言，包含9个多样化系统组件（如Etcd的Raft实现、Redis、Asterinas OS的Spinlock和Mutex等），并自动化评估语法正确性、运行时正确性、与系统代码一致性以及不变量正确性等指标。

Result: SysMoBench能够评估当前LLM和智能体在形式化建模方面的能力和局限性，为该领域工具提供坚实基础，并开辟有前景的新研究方向。

Conclusion: SysMoBench为评估AI生成大型复杂系统形式化模型的能力提供了重要基准，有助于理解当前AI技术的局限性和潜力，推动该领域的研究发展。

Abstract: Formal models are essential to specifying large, complex computer systems and
verifying their correctness, but are notoriously expensive to write and
maintain. Recent advances in generative AI show promise in generating certain
forms of specifications. However, existing work mostly targets small code, not
complete systems. It is unclear whether AI can deal with realistic system
artifacts, as this requires abstracting their complex behavioral properties
into formal models. We present SysMoBench, a benchmark that evaluates AI's
ability to formally model large, complex systems. We focus on concurrent and
distributed systems, which are keystones of today's critical computing
infrastructures, encompassing operating systems and cloud infrastructure. We
use TLA+, the de facto specification language for concurrent and distributed
systems, though the benchmark can be extended to other specification languages.
We address the primary challenge of evaluating AI-generated models by
automating metrics like syntactic and runtime correctness, conformance to
system code, and invariant correctness. SysMoBench currently includes nine
diverse system artifacts: the Raft implementation of Etcd and Redis, the
Spinlock and Mutex in Asterinas OS, etc.; more artifacts are being actively
added. SysMoBench enables us to understand the capabilities and limitations of
today's LLMs and agents, putting tools in this area on a firm footing and
opening up promising new research directions.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Memo是一个基于transformer的架构和训练方法，用于解决强化学习中记忆密集型、长时程任务的挑战。它通过在训练时插入周期性总结标记来创建和检索记忆，在网格世界元强化学习基准和逼真室内多目标导航任务中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于transformer的具身智能体策略训练中，视觉输入常常超出transformer的上下文限制，而人类能够将一生经验压缩为记忆来维持和利用。现有方法主要关注具有固定大小记忆的循环模型或完全依赖上下文的transformer，需要更好的记忆压缩和访问机制。

Method: 提出Memo架构，在模型训练过程中通过插入周期性总结标记来创建和检索记忆。这种方法能够压缩和抽象输入中的相关信息，同时保持计算和存储效率。

Result: Memo在网格世界元强化学习基准和逼真室内多目标导航任务中优于简单的长上下文transformer基线。它能够更好地泛化到更长的推理上下文，并在流式设置中保持鲁棒性。

Conclusion: Memo提供了一种有效的记忆机制，使transformer模型能够在记忆密集型、长时程任务中更好地运作，同时保持计算和存储效率，并具有更好的泛化能力和鲁棒性。

Abstract: To enable embodied agents to operate effectively over extended timeframes, it
is crucial to develop models that form and access memories to stay
contextualized in their environment. In the current paradigm of training
transformer-based policies for embodied sequential decision-making tasks,
visual inputs often overwhelm the context limits of transformers, while humans
can maintain and utilize a lifetime of experience compressed as memories.
Significant compression is possible in principle, as much of the input is
irrelevant and can be abstracted. However, existing approaches predominantly
focus on either recurrent models with fixed-size memory or transformers with
full-context reliance. In this work, we propose Memo, a transformer-based
architecture and training recipe for reinforcement learning (RL) on
memory-intensive, long-horizon tasks. Memo incorporates the creation and
retrieval of memory by interleaving periodic summarization tokens with the
inputs of a model during training. We demonstrate Memo's effectiveness on a
gridworld meta-RL benchmark and a multi-object navigation task in
photo-realistic indoor settings. Memo outperforms naive long-context
transformer baselines while being more compute and storage efficient.
Additionally, Memo generalizes better to longer contexts at inference time and
remains robust in streaming settings, where historical context must be
truncated to fit inference constraints.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前评估主动性的基准局限于局部上下文，无法测试跨来源和长时间跨度的推理能力。

Method: 设计PROBE基准，将主动性分解为三个能力维度，并应用于评估领先的LLM和智能体框架。

Result: 即使是先进模型也难以解决该基准，GPT-5和Claude Opus-4.1的最佳端到端性能仅为40%。

Conclusion: 结果突显了智能体系统在自主行动方面的当前局限性，并揭示了有前景的未来研究方向。

Abstract: LLM-based agents are increasingly moving towards proactivity: rather than
awaiting instruction, they exercise agency to anticipate user needs and solve
them autonomously. However, evaluating proactivity is challenging; current
benchmarks are constrained to localized context, limiting their ability to test
reasoning across sources and longer time horizons. To address this gap, we
present PROBE (Proactive Resolution Of BottlEnecks). PROBE decomposes
proactivity as a pipeline of three core capabilities: (1) searching for
unspecified issues, (2) identifying specific bottlenecks, and (3) executing
appropriate resolutions. We apply PROBE to evaluate leading LLMs and popular
agentic frameworks, showing that even state-of-the-art models struggle to solve
this benchmark. Computing our consistent measurements across frontier LLMs and
agents, we find that the best end-to-end performance of 40% is achieved by both
GPT-5 and Claude Opus-4.1. Additionally, we demonstrate the relative
capabilities of each model and analyze mutual failure modes. Our results
highlight the current limitations of autonomous action in agentic systems, and

TL;DR: WorldTest是一个评估模型学习智能体的协议，将无奖励交互与在不同但相关环境中的评分测试阶段分开，支持多种未知任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前世界模型学习和评估方法偏离了目标：训练和评估都锚定在下一帧预测上，成功通过在同一环境中奖励最大化来评分。

Method: 提出了WorldTest协议，包含无奖励探索、衍生测试和行为评分三个模板，并实例化为AutumnBench套件，包含43个交互式网格世界环境和129个任务。

Result: 比较了517名人类参与者和三个前沿模型，发现人类表现优于模型，扩展计算能力只在某些环境中提高性能。

Conclusion: WorldTest提供了一个新颖的模板来评估智能体对环境动态的学习情况，AutumnBench揭示了世界模型学习的显著改进空间。

Abstract: Model-learning agents should gather information to learn world models that
support many downstream tasks and inferences, such as predicting unobserved
states, estimating near- and far-term consequences of actions, planning action
sequences, and detecting changes in dynamics. Current methods for learning and
evaluating world models diverge from this goal: training and evaluation are
anchored to next-frame prediction, and success is scored by reward maximization
in the same environment. We propose WorldTest, a protocol to evaluate
model-learning agents that separates reward-free interaction from a scored test
phase in a different but related environment. WorldTest is
open-ended$\unicode{x2014}$models should support many different tasks unknown
ahead of time$\unicode{x2014}$and agnostic to model representation, allowing
comparison across approaches. We instantiated WorldTest with AutumnBench, a
suite of 43 interactive grid-world environments and 129 tasks across three
families: masked-frame prediction, planning, and predicting changes to the
causal dynamics. We compared 517 human participants and three frontier models
on AutumnBench. We found that humans outperform the models, and scaling compute
improves performance only in some environments but not others. WorldTest
provides a novel template$\unicode{x2014}$reward-free exploration, derived
tests, and behavior-based scoring$\unicode{x2014}$to evaluate what agents learn
about environment dynamics, and AutumnBench exposes significant headroom in
world-model learning.

### [207] [A flexible framework for structural plasticity in GPU-accelerated sparse spiking neural networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19764)
*James C. Knight,Johanna Senk,Thomas Nowotny*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: 提出了一个支持GPU加速结构可塑性的新框架，用于训练稀疏SNN分类器和学习拓扑图，相比密集模型训练时间减少10倍，同时保持性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生物大脑中的结构可塑性对学习、损伤恢复和资源优化至关重要，而传统机器学习框架主要关注突触可塑性，且为密集连接优化，无法有效减少训练成本。

Method: 基于GeNN模拟器开发GPU加速的结构可塑性框架，使用e-prop监督学习规则和DEEP R训练稀疏SNN分类器，并在无监督学习环境中学习拓扑图。

Result: 稀疏分类器训练时间减少高达10倍，通过DEEP R重连保持与原始模型相当的性能；实现了超实时拓扑图形成，提供了连接演化的洞察。

Conclusion: 该框架将促进网络结构和神经通信中稀疏性的实现与维护研究，以及在各种神经形态应用中探索稀疏性的计算优势。

Abstract: The majority of research in both training Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs)
and modeling learning in biological brains focuses on synaptic plasticity,
where learning equates to changing the strength of existing connections.
However, in biological brains, structural plasticity - where new connections
are created and others removed - is also vital, not only for effective learning
but also for recovery from damage and optimal resource usage. Inspired by
structural plasticity, pruning is often used in machine learning to remove weak
connections from trained models to reduce the computational requirements of
inference. However, the machine learning frameworks typically used for
backpropagation-based training of both ANNs and Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs)
are optimized for dense connectivity, meaning that pruning does not help reduce
the training costs of ever-larger models. The GeNN simulator already supports
efficient GPU-accelerated simulation of sparse SNNs for computational
neuroscience and machine learning. Here, we present a new flexible framework
for implementing GPU-accelerated structural plasticity rules and demonstrate
this first using the e-prop supervised learning rule and DEEP R to train
efficient, sparse SNN classifiers and then, in an unsupervised learning
context, to learn topographic maps. Compared to baseline dense models, our
sparse classifiers reduce training time by up to 10x while the DEEP R rewiring
enables them to perform as well as the original models. We demonstrate
topographic map formation in faster-than-realtime simulations, provide insights
into the connectivity evolution, and measure simulation speed versus network
size. The proposed framework will enable further research into achieving and
maintaining sparsity in network structure and neural communication, as well as
exploring the computational benefits of sparsity in a range of neuromorphic
applications.

*Minseok Jung,Abhas Ricky,Muhammad Rameez Chatni*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一个3D优化框架，联合校准AI推理扩展中的准确性、成本和延迟，通过多目标优化方法在统一决策空间中实现约束感知的推理扩展。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的1D启发式方法和2D双变量权衡无法同时考虑成本、延迟和准确性约束，需要更全面的优化框架。

Method: 使用蒙特卡洛模拟在三个代表性场景和九个模拟大语言模型上评估四种优化方法，解决3D多目标优化问题。

Result: 膝点优化实现了最佳平衡，当精度优先时准确性最大化方法仍然有利，该框架为不同操作环境下的部署感知推理扩展建立了理论基础。

Conclusion: 3D多目标优化框架能够捕捉1D和2D优化无法覆盖的可行空间，实现环境自适应的推理扩展参数选择。

Abstract: AI inference scaling is often tuned through 1D heuristics (a fixed reasoning
passes) or 2D bivariate trade-offs (e.g., performance vs. compute), which fail
to consider cost and latency constraints. We introduce a 3D optimization
framework that jointly calibrates accuracy, cost, and latency within a unified
decision space, enabling constraints-aware inference scaling. Using Monte Carlo
simulations across three representative scenarios and nine simulated large
language models, we evaluate four optimization methods to address the 3D
multi-objective optimization (MOO) problem. Framing inference scaling in MOO
shapes a feasible space that 1D and 2D optimizations fail to capture, enabling
environmentadaptive selection of the inference scaling k. Results show that
knee-point optimization achieves the best balance, while accuracy-maximization
remains favorable when precision is prioritized. The framework establishes a
theoretical foundation for deployment-aware inference scaling across diverse
operational contexts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI模型在临床应用中因样本量有限而性能受限，需要可靠的功能性神经影像基础模型。自监督学习与脑-结果关系不一定对齐，导致现有基础模型对下游任务（如疾病预测）不够优化。

Method: 将脑建模构建为多任务学习，提出可扩展的模型架构：(i) 通过标记多个脑-环境交互进行多任务预训练，(ii) 通过分配预训练BEI的伪标签进行半监督微调。

Result: 在性别预测、人类行为识别以及自闭症、帕金森病、阿尔茨海默病和精神分裂症等疾病的早期诊断等多种应用中评估，显示出促进当前神经影像临床应用的巨大潜力。

Conclusion: 该方法通过结合环境变量和人口统计数据，构建了更有效的功能性神经影像基础模型，有望显著提升神经影像在临床常规应用中的性能。

Abstract: A reliable foundation model of functional neuroimages is critical to promote
clinical applications where the performance of current AI models is
significantly impeded by a limited sample size. To that end, tremendous efforts
have been made to pretraining large models on extensive unlabeled fMRI data
using scalable self-supervised learning. Since self-supervision is not
necessarily aligned with the brain-to-outcome relationship, most foundation
models are suboptimal to the downstream task, such as predicting disease
outcomes. By capitalizing on rich environmental variables and demographic data
along with an unprecedented amount of functional neuroimages, we form the brain
modeling as a multitask learning and present a scalable model architecture for
(i) multitask pretraining by tokenizing multiple brain-environment interactions
(BEI) and (ii) semi-supervised finetuning by assigning pseudo-labels of
pretrained BEI. We have evaluated our foundation model on a variety of
applications, including sex prediction, human behavior recognition, and disease
early diagnosis of Autism, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and
{Schizophrenia}, where promising results indicate the great potential to
facilitate current neuroimaging applications in clinical routines.

TL;DR: ADPO是DPO的泛化框架，引入软偏好概率、任意参考策略锚定和列表偏好建模，在噪声环境下显著提升性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准DPO假设硬二元标签和成对比较，存在梯度漂移问题，需要更鲁棒的偏好优化方法

Method: 提出ADPO框架，包含软偏好概率、参考策略锚定和Plackett-Luce分布列表建模，推导出DPO、Bradley-Terry等作为特例

Result: 在上下文赌博机中锚定将WinMass提升38-63%，KDE平滑在重尾噪声下达到0.68 vs 0.32（112%相对增益）；在强化学习中锚定提升噪声偏好性能15-29%

Conclusion: 推荐使用成对锚定Soft-DPO处理清洁或中等噪声，KDE列表ADPO处理极端污染

Abstract: Anchored Direct Preference Optimization (ADPO) is a unified framework that
generalizes Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) with soft preferences,
reference-policy anchoring, and groupwise extensions. While standard DPO
assumes hard binary labels and pairwise comparisons, ADPO introduces: (i) soft
preference probabilities that encode uncertainty and mitigate gradient drift;
(ii) arbitrary reference-policy anchors that stabilize training via groupwise
shift invariance and implicit KL regularization; and (iii) listwise preference
modeling through Plackett-Luce distributions. We prove that DPO, Bradley-Terry
objectives, and Top-1-vs-Rest formulations emerge as special cases. ADPO yields
three practical variants: pairwise anchored Soft-DPO, listwise anchored
Soft-DPO with raw rewards, and KDE-based listwise smoothing for heavy-tailed
noise. In contextual bandits, anchoring improves WinMass by 38-63% over
standard DPO, while KDE smoothing achieves 0.68 vs 0.32 under heavy-tailed
contamination (112% relative gain). In sequential reinforcement learning
(CartPole, LunarLander), anchoring improves noisy-preference performance by
15-29%, confirming transfer from single-step to multi-step settings.
Experiments with 10-256 parameter models provide clear guidance: use pairwise
anchored Soft-DPO for clean or moderate noise, and KDE-based listwise ADPO for
extreme contamination.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型和机器学习的广泛应用，需要在笔记本电脑和移动设备等小型设备上部署这些模型，因此需要能够利用设备硬件的框架和方法。

Method: 创建MLX-transformers框架，包含不同的Transformer实现，将PyTorch模型检查点转换为MLX格式，在苹果硅设备上评估BERT、RoBERTa和XLM-RoBERTa模型的推理延迟性能。

Result: 研究结果表明MLX在苹果生态系统内能够实现高效且更易访问的设备上机器学习应用。

Conclusion: MLX框架在苹果硅设备上具有潜力，能够支持高效的设备上机器学习应用开发。

Abstract: The recent widespread adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) and machine
learning in general has sparked research interest in exploring the
possibilities of deploying these models on smaller devices such as laptops and
mobile phones. This creates a need for frameworks and approaches that are
capable of taking advantage of on-device hardware. The MLX framework was
created to address this need. It is a framework optimized for machine learning
(ML) computations on Apple silicon devices, facilitating easier research,
experimentation, and prototyping.
  This paper presents a performance evaluation of MLX, focusing on inference
latency of transformer models. We compare the performance of different
transformer architecture implementations in MLX with their Pytorch
counterparts. For this research we create a framework called MLX-transformers
which includes different transformer implementations in MLX and downloads the
model checkpoints in pytorch and converts it to the MLX format. By leveraging
the advanced architecture and capabilities of Apple Silicon, MLX-Transformers
enables seamless execution of transformer models directly sourced from Hugging
Face, eliminating the need for checkpoint conversion often required when
porting models between frameworks.
  Our study benchmarks different transformer models on two Apple Silicon
macbook devices against an NVIDIA CUDA GPU. Specifically, we compare the
inference latency performance of models with the same parameter sizes and
checkpoints. We evaluate the performance of BERT, RoBERTa, and XLM-RoBERTa
models, with the intention of extending future work to include models of
different modalities, thus providing a more comprehensive assessment of MLX's
capabilities. The results highlight MLX's potential in enabling efficient and
more accessible on-device ML applications within Apple's ecosystem.

TL;DR: 提出了一种噪声鲁棒的Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)和Dr.GRPO框架，通过建模奖励噪声为伯努利噪声，在估计奖励翻转概率后应用噪声校正来去偏学习信号，获得可证明无偏的梯度估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RLHF或RLVR等标准对齐方法对不一致或错误奖励的噪声高度敏感，但此类噪声与广泛使用的基于群体的策略优化方法之间的相互作用尚未得到充分探索。

Method: 引入GRPO和Dr.GRPO框架，将奖励腐败建模为伯努利噪声，应用噪声校正来去偏学习信号，获得无偏梯度估计。理论分析显示基于群体的方法固有地减轻个体级噪声。

Result: 在数学和代码任务上观察到一致的改进，在真实奖励模型条件下，数学任务准确率提升高达6.7个百分点，代码任务提升1.5个百分点。

Conclusion: 这项工作将监督学习中的标签噪声校正与现代RLHF联系起来，为噪声现实世界部署提供了理论见解和实用算法。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) or verifiable rewards
(RLVR), the standard paradigm for aligning LLMs or building recent SOTA
reasoning models, is highly sensitive to noise from inconsistent or erroneous
rewards. Yet, the interaction between such noise and widely used group-based
policy optimization methods remains underexplored. We introduce a noise-robust
Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and Done Right GRPO (Dr.GRPO)
framework that explicitly models reward corruption as Bernoulli noise. Our
method applies noise correction after estimating reward flip probabilities to
debias the learning signal, yielding provably unbiased gradient estimates.
Theoretical analysis shows that group-based methods inherently mitigate
individual-level noise, and our correction strategy amplifies this robustness.
Empirically, we observe consistent improvements across math and code tasks when
applying our noise correction to standard reward model usage, with particular
gains of up to 6.7 percentage points in accuracy on math tasks and 1.5 on code
tasks under realistic reward model conditions. This work bridges label-noise
correction from supervised learning with modern RLHF, offering both theoretical
insights and a practical algorithm for noisy real-world deployment.

Motivation: 传统机器学习方法难以捕捉复杂多尺度系统的高频行为和动态特性，需要开发能够同时处理宏观和微观尺度动态的新方法。

Conclusion: 提出的多尺度学习方法为研究复杂系统的所有时间尺度提供了有效的近似和解释框架，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Modeling and predicting the dynamics of complex multiscale systems remains a
significant challenge due to their inherent nonlinearities and sensitivity to
initial conditions, as well as limitations of traditional machine learning
methods that fail to capture high frequency behaviours. To overcome these
difficulties, we propose three approaches for multiscale learning. The first
leverages the Partition of Unity (PU) method, integrated with neural networks,
to decompose the dynamics into local components and directly predict both
macro- and micro-scale behaviors. The second applies the Singular Value
Decomposition (SVD) to extract dominant modes that explicitly separate macro-
and micro-scale dynamics. Since full access to the data matrix is rarely
available in practice, we further employ a Sparse High-Order SVD to reconstruct
multiscale dynamics from limited measurements. Together, these approaches
ensure that both coarse and fine dynamics are accurately captured, making the
framework effective for real-world applications involving complex, multi-scale
phenomena and adaptable to higher-dimensional systems with incomplete
observations, by providing an approximation and interpretation in all time
scales present in the phenomena under study.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 离线强化学习在大型语言模型对齐中面临策略熵急剧下降、优化不稳定甚至崩溃的挑战，主要原因是负优势样本主导策略梯度以及固定裁剪机制阻碍熵增加更新。

Method: 提出BAPO方法，基于熵裁剪规则动态调整裁剪边界，自适应平衡正负贡献，保持策略熵并稳定强化学习优化。

Result: 在AIME 2024和2025基准测试中，7B BAPO模型超越开源对手SkyWork-OR1-7B，32B BAPO模型在同等规模模型中达到最先进水平，甚至超过o3-mini和Gemini-2.5-Flash-Thinking等专有系统。

Conclusion: BAPO方法能够实现快速、稳定且数据高效的训练，有效解决了离线强化学习中的优化不平衡问题。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has recently become the core paradigm for
aligning and strengthening large language models (LLMs). Yet, applying RL in
off-policy settings--where stale data from past policies are used for
training--improves sample efficiency, but remains challenging: policy entropy
declines sharply, optimization often becomes unstable and may even collapse.
Through theoretical and empirical analysis, we identify two key insights: (i)
an imbalance in optimization, where negative-advantage samples dominate the
policy gradient, suppressing useful behaviors and risking gradient explosions;
and (ii) the derived Entropy-Clip Rule, which reveals that the fixed clipping
mechanism in PPO-like objectives systematically blocks entropy-increasing
updates, thereby driving the policy toward over-exploitation at the expense of
exploration. Building on these insights, we propose BAlanced Policy
Optimization with Adaptive Clipping (BAPO), a simple yet effective method that
dynamically adjusts clipping bounds to adaptively re-balance positive and
negative contributions, preserve entropy, and stabilize RL optimization. Across
diverse off-policy scenarios--including sample replay and partial rollout--BAPO
achieves fast, stable, and data-efficient training. On AIME 2024 and AIME 2025
benchmarks, our 7B BAPO model surpasses open-source counterparts such as
SkyWork-OR1-7B, while our 32B BAPO model not only achieves state-of-the-art
results among models of the same scale but also outperforms leading proprietary
systems like o3-mini and Gemini-2.5-Flash-Thinking.

TL;DR: 本文指出许多深度神经网络的事后泛化度量是脆弱的——微小的训练修改会显著改变度量的值、趋势或缩放行为，即使这些修改几乎不影响DNN本身。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然深度神经网络的各种泛化度量难以获得紧致边界，但通常被认为能重现定性的泛化趋势。本文旨在揭示这些事后度量的脆弱性。

Method: 通过实验展示微小的超参数调整（如学习率变化或SGD变体切换）如何反转学习曲线的斜率，并识别更微妙形式的脆弱性。

Result: 发现路径范数、谱范数、Frobenius范数、平坦度代理和确定性PAC-Bayes代理等许多边界都是脆弱的，而PAC-Bayes原点度量虽然对超参数变化不敏感，但无法捕捉数据复杂度的差异。

Conclusion: 建议新度量开发者应明确审计其度量的脆弱性，并指出函数基础的边际似然PAC-Bayes边界能捕捉数据复杂度差异，但不是事后度量。

Abstract: A wide variety of generalization measures have been applied to deep neural
networks (DNNs). Although obtaining tight bounds remains challenging, such
measures are often assumed to reproduce qualitative generalization trends. In
this position paper, we argue that many post-mortem generalization measures --
those computed on trained networks -- are \textbf{fragile}: small training
modifications that barely affect the underlying DNN can substantially change a
measure's value, trend, or scaling behavior. For example, minor hyperparameter
changes, such as learning rate adjustments or switching between SGD variants
can reverse the slope of a learning curve in widely used generalization
measures like the path norm. We also identify subtler forms of fragility. For
instance, the PAC-Bayes origin measure is regarded as one of the most reliable,
and is indeed less sensitive to hyperparameter tweaks than many other measures.
However, it completely fails to capture differences in data complexity across
learning curves. This data fragility contrasts with the function-based
marginal-likelihood PAC-Bayes bound, which does capture differences in
data-complexity, including scaling behavior, in learning curves, but which is
not a post-mortem measure. Beyond demonstrating that many bounds -- such as
path, spectral and Frobenius norms, flatness proxies, and deterministic
PAC-Bayes surrogates -- are fragile, this position paper also argues that
developers of new measures should explicitly audit them for fragility.

TL;DR: 提出NeuroAda方法，在保持高内存效率的同时实现细粒度模型微调，仅需≤0.02%可训练参数即可达到SOTA性能，减少CUDA内存使用达60%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有参数高效微调方法存在权衡：基于添加的方法（如LoRA）内存效率高但表示能力有限；选择性原位适应方法适应更精确但内存消耗大。需要平衡这一权衡。

Method: 首先识别网络中的重要参数，然后为这些选定参数引入旁路连接。微调时仅更新旁路连接，保持原始模型参数冻结。

Result: 在23+个自然语言生成和理解任务上的实证结果表明，NeuroAda仅需≤0.02%可训练参数即可达到最先进性能，同时减少CUDA内存使用达60%。

Conclusion: NeuroAda成功平衡了细粒度适应和内存效率之间的权衡，为参数高效微调提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Existing parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods primarily fall into
two categories: addition-based and selective in-situ adaptation. The former,
such as LoRA, introduce additional modules to adapt the model to downstream
tasks, offering strong memory efficiency. However, their representational
capacity is often limited, making them less suitable for fine-grained
adaptation. In contrast, the latter directly fine-tunes a carefully chosen
subset of the original model parameters, allowing for more precise and
effective adaptation, but at the cost of significantly increased memory
consumption. To reconcile this trade-off, we propose NeuroAda, a novel PEFT
method that enables fine-grained model finetuning while maintaining high memory
efficiency. Our approach first identifies important parameters (i.e.,
connections within the network) as in selective adaptation, and then introduces
bypass connections for these selected parameters. During finetuning, only the
bypass connections are updated, leaving the original model parameters frozen.
Empirical results on 23+ tasks spanning both natural language generation and
understanding demonstrate that NeuroAda achieves state-of-the-art performance
with as little as $\leq \textbf{0.02}\%$ trainable parameters, while reducing
CUDA memory usage by up to 60%. We release our code here:

Conclusion: 对抗蒸馏框架有效解决了神经算子的分布外泛化问题，为PDE求解提供了既快速又鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Nonlinear PDE solvers require fine space-time discretizations and local
linearizations, leading to high memory cost and slow runtimes. Neural operators
such as FNOs and DeepONets offer fast single-shot inference by learning
function-to-function mappings and truncating high-frequency components, but
they suffer from poor out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization, often failing
on inputs outside the training distribution. We propose an adversarial
teacher-student distillation framework in which a differentiable numerical
solver supervises a compact neural operator while a PGD-style active sampling
loop searches for worst-case inputs under smoothness and energy constraints to
expand the training set. Using differentiable spectral solvers enables
gradient-based adversarial search and stabilizes sample mining. Experiments on
Burgers and Navier-Stokes systems demonstrate that adversarial distillation
substantially improves OOD robustness while preserving the low parameter cost
and fast inference of neural operators.

Motivation: 自编码器在时间序列异常检测中广泛应用，但其学习到的表示对训练时间序列中的异常敏感，导致检测精度降低。需要解决训练数据被污染时的鲁棒性问题。

Abstract: Time series anomaly detection is important in modern large-scale systems and
is applied in a variety of domains to analyze and monitor the operation of
diverse systems. Unsupervised approaches have received widespread interest, as
they do not require anomaly labels during training, thus avoiding potentially
high costs and having wider applications. Among these, autoencoders have
received extensive attention. They use reconstruction errors from compressed
representations to define anomaly scores. However, representations learned by
autoencoders are sensitive to anomalies in training time series, causing
reduced accuracy. We propose a novel encode-then-decompose paradigm, where we
decompose the encoded representation into stable and auxiliary representations,
thereby enhancing the robustness when training with contaminated time series.
In addition, we propose a novel mutual information based metric to replace the
reconstruction errors for identifying anomalies. Our proposal demonstrates
competitive or state-of-the-art performance on eight commonly used multi- and
univariate time series benchmarks and exhibits robustness to time series with
different contamination ratios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前医疗实践依赖标准化治疗框架，忽视患者个体差异，导致次优健康结果。需要开发个性化医疗系统来适应特定患者特征。

Method: 使用LLM处理非结构化医疗文本（93.2%准确率），CTGAN生成合成患者数据（55%准确率），T-learner预测个体治疗反应（84.3%准确率），上下文bandit优化在线治疗选择。

Result: 在III期结肠癌数据集测试中，KernelUCB方法在5000轮中获得0.60-0.61平均奖励分数，优于其他参考方法。

Conclusion: 该系统克服了在线学习环境中的冷启动限制，提高了计算效率，在个性化医疗方面取得了显著进展。

Abstract: Current medical practice depends on standardized treatment frameworks and
empirical methodologies that neglect individual patient variations, leading to
suboptimal health outcomes. We develop a comprehensive system integrating Large
Language Models (LLMs), Conditional Tabular Generative Adversarial Networks
(CTGAN), T-learner counterfactual models, and contextual bandit approaches to
provide customized, data-informed clinical recommendations. The approach
utilizes LLMs to process unstructured medical narratives into structured
datasets (93.2% accuracy), uses CTGANs to produce realistic synthetic patient
data (55% accuracy via two-sample verification), deploys T-learners to forecast
patient-specific treatment responses (84.3% accuracy), and integrates
prior-informed contextual bandits to enhance online therapeutic selection by
effectively balancing exploration of new possibilities with exploitation of
existing knowledge. Testing on stage III colon cancer datasets revealed that
our KernelUCB approach obtained 0.60-0.61 average reward scores across 5,000
rounds, exceeding other reference methods. This comprehensive system overcomes
cold-start limitations in online learning environments, improves computational
effectiveness, and constitutes notable progress toward individualized medicine
adapted to specific patient characteristics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将动物类别学习中观察到的类别感知现象（在类别边界附近增强刺激区分能力）的理论框架扩展到人工神经网络，解释高效学习如何导致神经表征的扩展/压缩。

Method: 基于结构化数据和低维特征空间的假设，通过最大化互信息来寻找合适的投影空间并构建适当的神经度量，使用Fisher信息矩阵衡量神经活动对投影空间变化的敏感性。

Result: 研究发现最优学习使神经Fisher信息遵循类别特定的Fisher信息，其最大值通常不在类别边界上而是在边界附近，在玩具模型和MNIST数据集上验证了学习后两种Fisher信息矩阵的匹配。

Conclusion: 类别学习在决策边界附近诱导神经空间扩展，Fisher信息矩阵的特征向量给出了投影空间中每个点的最具判别力方向，该方法与信息瓶颈方法相关，并展示了贝叶斯成本的偏差-方差分解。

Abstract: In animals, category learning enhances discrimination between stimuli close
to the category boundary. This phenomenon, called categorical perception, was
also empirically observed in artificial neural networks trained on
classification tasks. In previous modeling works based on neuroscience data, we
show that this expansion/compression is a necessary outcome of efficient
learning. Here we extend our theoretical framework to artificial networks. We
show that minimizing the Bayes cost (mean of the cross-entropy loss) implies
maximizing the mutual information between the set of categories and the neural
activities prior to the decision layer. Considering structured data with an
underlying feature space of small dimension, we show that maximizing the mutual
information implies (i) finding an appropriate projection space, and, (ii)
building a neural representation with the appropriate metric. The latter is
based on a Fisher information matrix measuring the sensitivity of the neural
activity to changes in the projection space. Optimal learning makes this neural
Fisher information follow a category-specific Fisher information, measuring the
sensitivity of the category membership. Category learning thus induces an
expansion of neural space near decision boundaries. We characterize the
properties of the categorical Fisher information, showing that its eigenvectors
give the most discriminant directions at each point of the projection space. We
find that, unexpectedly, its maxima are in general not exactly at, but near,
the class boundaries. Considering toy models and the MNIST dataset, we
numerically illustrate how after learning the two Fisher information matrices
match, and essentially align with the category boundaries. Finally, we relate
our approach to the Information Bottleneck one, and we exhibit a bias-variance
decomposition of the Bayes cost, of interest on its own.

*Nakul Upadhya,Eldan Cohen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的决策树泛化方法——形状泛化树（SGT），通过在节点中使用可学习的轴对齐形状函数来替代传统的线性分割，实现了非线性特征效应的单次分割捕获，同时保持可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统决策树依赖简单的轴对齐线性分割，为了捕捉非线性特征效应往往需要构建深而复杂的树结构，这削弱了模型的可解释性。

Method: 提出了SGT框架，每个内部节点对单个特征应用可学习的轴对齐形状函数；开发了ShapeCART算法来学习SGT；进一步扩展到双变量形状函数（S²GT）和多路树（SGT_K）。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，SGT相比传统的轴对齐线性树，在减少模型大小的同时实现了更优越的性能。

Conclusion: SGT通过引入可学习的形状函数，在保持决策树可解释性的同时，显著提升了模型性能并减少了模型复杂度。

Abstract: Decision trees are prized for their interpretability and strong performance
on tabular data. Yet, their reliance on simple axis-aligned linear splits often
forces deep, complex structures to capture non-linear feature effects,
undermining human comprehension of the constructed tree. To address this
limitation, we propose a novel generalization of a decision tree, the Shape
Generalized Tree (SGT), in which each internal node applies a learnable
axis-aligned shape function to a single feature, enabling rich, non-linear
partitioning in one split. As users can easily visualize each node's shape
function, SGTs are inherently interpretable and provide intuitive, visual
explanations of the model's decision mechanisms. To learn SGTs from data, we
propose ShapeCART, an efficient induction algorithm for SGTs. We further extend
the SGT framework to bivariate shape functions (S$^2$GT) and multi-way trees
(SGT$_K$), and present Shape$^2$CART and ShapeCART$_K$, extensions to ShapeCART
for learning S$^2$GTs and SGT$_K$s, respectively. Experiments on various
datasets show that SGTs achieve superior performance with reduced model size
compared to traditional axis-aligned linear trees.

TL;DR: POLAR是一个基于强化学习的联邦学习后门攻击方法，通过策略梯度优化选择关键层进行攻击，在保持隐蔽性的同时实现高攻击成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的联邦学习后门攻击方法基于规则选择关键层，没有考虑层间相互关系，导致攻击效果不佳且容易被先进防御机制检测到。

Method: 提出POLAR框架，采用轻量级伯努利采样的强化学习方法，动态学习攻击策略，通过策略梯度更新基于后门成功率优化层选择，并引入正则化约束限制修改层数以保持隐蔽性。

Result: 广泛实验表明，POLAR在对抗六种最先进防御方法时，比最新攻击方法性能提升高达40%。

Conclusion: POLAR是首个采用强化学习解决层间后门攻击关键层选择问题的管道，在攻击效果和隐蔽性方面均优于现有方法。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables decentralized model training across multiple
clients without exposing local data, but its distributed feature makes it
vulnerable to backdoor attacks. Despite early FL backdoor attacks modifying
entire models, recent studies have explored the concept of backdoor-critical
(BC) layers, which poison the chosen influential layers to maintain
stealthiness while achieving high effectiveness. However, existing BC layers
approaches rely on rule-based selection without consideration of the
interrelations between layers, making them ineffective and prone to detection
by advanced defenses. In this paper, we propose POLAR (POlicy-based LAyerwise
Reinforcement learning), the first pipeline to creatively adopt RL to solve the
BC layer selection problem in layer-wise backdoor attack. Different from other
commonly used RL paradigm, POLAR is lightweight with Bernoulli sampling. POLAR
dynamically learns an attack strategy, optimizing layer selection using policy
gradient updates based on backdoor success rate (BSR) improvements. To ensure
stealthiness, we introduce a regularization constraint that limits the number
of modified layers by penalizing large attack footprints. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that POLAR outperforms the latest attack methods by up to 40%
against six state-of-the-art (SOTA) defenses.

*Atli Kosson,Jeremy Welborn,Yang Liu,Martin Jaggi,Xi Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: muP学习率参数化方法在训练初期有效，但实际训练中权重衰减才是稳定更新动态的关键因素，muP主要起到隐式学习率预热的作用


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究如何将小规模神经网络的最优学习率转移到大规模网络，以实现高效训练，避免在大规模场景下进行昂贵的超参数调优

Method: 进行大规模实证研究，分析muP参数化方法的假设条件在实际训练中的有效性，比较muP与权重衰减在稳定内部表示更新动态方面的作用

Result: 发现muP的假设仅在训练初期成立，在LLM训练等实际场景中，权重衰减而非muP能正确稳定跨宽度模型的更新动态，促进学习率转移

Conclusion: muP的缩放规则主要起到隐式学习率预热的作用，可以通过修改预热计划来替代，这挑战了关于学习率转移的普遍认知，并解释了为什么muP需要独立权重衰减变体

Abstract: Transferring the optimal learning rate from small to large neural networks
can enable efficient training at scales where hyperparameter tuning is
otherwise prohibitively expensive. To this end, the Maximal Update
Parameterization (muP) proposes a learning rate scaling designed to keep the
update dynamics of internal representations stable across different model
widths. However, the scaling rules of muP rely on strong assumptions,
particularly about the geometric alignment of a layer's inputs with both its
weights and gradient updates. In this large-scale empirical investigation, we
show that these assumptions hold only briefly at the start of training in the
practical setups where learning rate transfer is most valuable, such as LLM
training. For the remainder of training it is weight decay rather than muP that
correctly stabilizes the update dynamics of internal representations across
widths, facilitating learning rate transfer. This suggests muP's scaling
primarily acts as a form of implicit learning rate warmup, allowing us to
largely replace it with modified warmup schedules. Together these findings
fundamentally challenge prevailing beliefs about learning rate transfer and can
explain empirical practice such as why muP requires the independent weight
decay variant for successful transfer.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决课程学习在大型语言模型推理中的基本问题：何时有效、哪种方向更好、答案是否依赖于测量指标，由于先前研究使用不同的难度指标和训练设置，这些问题尚未得到明确回答。

Method: 使用统一的离线评估框架，将课程难度分解为五个互补维度：问题难度、模型惊奇度、置信度边际、预测不确定性和决策变异性，在数学推理基准上对Llama3.1-8B、Mistral-7B和Gemma3-4B进行受控后训练实验。

Result: 发现(i)没有课程策略普遍占优，(ii)即使在单一指标内，不同难度级别的样本根据任务需求产生不同的收益，(iii)任务对齐课程侧重于塑造模型的最终表示和泛化，而内部状态课程调节内部状态如置信度和不确定性。

Conclusion: 研究结果挑战了通用课程策略的概念，为不同模型和任务机制提供了可操作的指导，某些指标表明优先处理决策不确定样本可以进一步改善学习效果。

Abstract: Curriculum learning (CL) - ordering training data from easy to hard - has
become a popular strategy for improving reasoning in large language models
(LLMs). Yet prior work employs disparate difficulty metrics and training
setups, leaving open fundamental questions: When does curriculum help? Which
direction - forward or reverse - is better? And does the answer depend on what
we measure? We address these questions through a unified offline evaluation
framework that decomposes curriculum difficulty into five complementary
dimensions: Problem Difficulty, Model Surprisal, Confidence Margin, Predictive
Uncertainty, and Decision Variability. Through controlled post-training
experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks with Llama3.1-8B, Mistral-7B,
and Gemma3-4B, we find that (i) no curriculum strategy dominates universally -
the relative effectiveness of forward versus reverse CL depends jointly on
model capability and task complexity; (ii) even within a single metric, samples
at different difficulty levels produce distinct gains depending on task
demands; and (iii) task-aligned curricula focus on shaping the model's final
representations and generalization, whereas inner-state curricula modulate
internal states such as confidence and uncertainty. Our findings challenge the
notion of a universal curriculum strategy and offer actionable guidance across
model and task regimes, with some metrics indicating that prioritizing
decision-uncertain samples can further enhance learning outcomes.

TL;DR: MetaCluster框架通过元学习器和聚类技术显著压缩Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks的参数存储，实现高达80倍的压缩率且不损失精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: KANs用向量权重替代标量权重提高了表达能力，但导致参数和内存呈倍数增长，需要高效的压缩方法。

Method: 使用轻量级元学习器将低维嵌入映射到系数向量，通过K-means聚类将边向量替换为共享质心，然后微调质心码本恢复精度。

Result: 在MNIST、CIFAR-10和CIFAR-100数据集上，MetaCluster实现了高达80倍的参数存储减少，且无精度损失。

Conclusion: MetaCluster成功解决了KANs参数爆炸问题，为高效部署提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) replace scalar weights with per-edge
vectors of basis coefficients, thereby boosting expressivity and accuracy but
at the same time resulting in a multiplicative increase in parameters and
memory. We propose MetaCluster, a framework that makes KANs highly compressible
without sacrificing accuracy. Specifically, a lightweight meta-learner, trained
jointly with the KAN, is used to map low-dimensional embedding to coefficient
vectors, shaping them to lie on a low-dimensional manifold that is amenable to
clustering. We then run K-means in coefficient space and replace per-edge
vectors with shared centroids. Afterwards, the meta-learner can be discarded,
and a brief fine-tuning of the centroid codebook recovers any residual accuracy
loss. The resulting model stores only a small codebook and per-edge indices,
exploiting the vector nature of KAN parameters to amortize storage across
multiple coefficients. On MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100, across standard KANs
and ConvKANs using multiple basis functions, MetaCluster achieves a reduction
of up to 80$\times$ in parameter storage, with no loss in accuracy. Code will
be released upon publication.

Motivation: 在社交网络中，同伴推荐的成功率高度依赖于上下文因素，准确估计这些影响力概率对于理解信息传播过程和改进病毒式营销策略至关重要。

Method: 采用上下文线性赌博机框架，提出不确定性引导的探索算法，通过调节参数在遗憾最小化与估计误差之间实现任意权衡。

Result: 在半合成网络数据集上的实验表明，该方法优于静态方法和忽略这种权衡的上下文赌博机方法。

Conclusion: 成功解决了同伴影响力概率学习中的基本权衡问题，提出的算法能够灵活地在不同目标之间进行权衡，为信息传播建模和营销策略优化提供了有效工具。

Abstract: In networked environments, users frequently share recommendations about
content, products, services, and courses of action with others. The extent to
which such recommendations are successful and adopted is highly contextual,
dependent on the characteristics of the sender, recipient, their relationship,
the recommended item, and the medium, which makes peer influence probabilities
highly heterogeneous. Accurate estimation of these probabilities is key to
understanding information diffusion processes and to improving the
effectiveness of viral marketing strategies. However, learning these
probabilities from data is challenging; static data may capture correlations
between peer recommendations and peer actions but fails to reveal influence
relationships. Online learning algorithms can learn these probabilities from
interventions but either waste resources by learning from random exploration or
optimize for rewards, thus favoring exploration of the space with higher
influence probabilities. In this work, we study learning peer influence
probabilities under a contextual linear bandit framework. We show that a
fundamental trade-off can arise between regret minimization and estimation
error, characterize all achievable rate pairs, and propose an
uncertainty-guided exploration algorithm that, by tuning a parameter, attains
any pair within this trade-off. Our experiments on semi-synthetic network
datasets show the advantages of our method over static methods and contextual
bandits that ignore this trade-off.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有可控音乐生成方法通常需要重新训练模型或会产生可听伪影，需要一种能够对冻结预训练模型进行精细控制且不影响生成质量的方法。

Method: 训练轻量级RFM探针发现MusicGen隐藏状态中的概念方向，在推理时将这些方向注入模型以实时引导生成过程，无需每步优化，支持动态时间变化调度和多重音乐属性同时控制。

Result: 将目标音符生成准确率从0.23提升到0.82，文本提示遵循度保持在未引导基线的0.02范围内，实现了有效控制且对提示保真度影响最小。

Conclusion: MusicRFM成功平衡了控制与生成质量之间的权衡，为音乐领域RFM的进一步探索提供了可行框架。

Abstract: Controllable music generation remains a significant challenge, with existing
methods often requiring model retraining or introducing audible artifacts. We
introduce MusicRFM, a framework that adapts Recursive Feature Machines (RFMs)
to enable fine-grained, interpretable control over frozen, pre-trained music
models by directly steering their internal activations. RFMs analyze a model's
internal gradients to produce interpretable "concept directions", or specific
axes in the activation space that correspond to musical attributes like notes
or chords. We first train lightweight RFM probes to discover these directions
within MusicGen's hidden states; then, during inference, we inject them back
into the model to guide the generation process in real-time without per-step
optimization. We present advanced mechanisms for this control, including
dynamic, time-varying schedules and methods for the simultaneous enforcement of
multiple musical properties. Our method successfully navigates the trade-off
between control and generation quality: we can increase the accuracy of
generating a target musical note from 0.23 to 0.82, while text prompt adherence
remains within approximately 0.02 of the unsteered baseline, demonstrating
effective control with minimal impact on prompt fidelity. We release code to
encourage further exploration on RFMs in the music domain.

Motivation: 传统Granger因果性测试基于线性模型，难以检测非线性因果关系。现有非线性方法依赖因果充分性和已知干预目标两个关键假设，但现实时间序列数据通常存在潜在混杂因素和异质环境，缺乏干预先验知识。

Method: 提出InvarGC方法，利用跨环境异质性来缓解潜在混杂因素的影响，并在边缘级别粒度上区分干预与非干预环境，从而恢复不变的因果关系。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法相比最先进方法具有竞争力。

Conclusion: 建立了在这些条件下的可识别性，提出的InvarGC方法能够有效处理现实世界时间序列数据中的因果发现挑战。

Abstract: Granger causality is widely used for causal structure discovery in complex
systems from multivariate time series data. Traditional Granger causality tests
based on linear models often fail to detect even mild non-linear causal
relationships. Therefore, numerous recent studies have investigated non-linear
Granger causality methods, achieving improved performance. However, these
methods often rely on two key assumptions: causal sufficiency and known
interventional targets. Causal sufficiency assumes the absence of latent
confounders, yet their presence can introduce spurious correlations. Moreover,
real-world time series data usually come from heterogeneous environments,
without prior knowledge of interventions. Therefore, in practice, it is
difficult to distinguish intervened environments from non-intervened ones, and
even harder to identify which variables or timesteps are affected. To address
these challenges, we propose Invariant Granger Causality (InvarGC), which
leverages cross-environment heterogeneity to mitigate the effects of latent
confounding and to distinguish intervened from non-intervened environments with
edge-level granularity, thereby recovering invariant causal relations. In
addition, we establish the identifiability under these conditions. Extensive
experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the
competitive performance of our approach compared to state-of-the-art methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着机器学习模型越来越多地在合成数据上进行微调，存在潜藏污染的关键风险——不良特征通过语义中立数据传播，绕过标准安全检查。虽然这种现象已被识别，但对其动态的定量理解仍然缺失。

Method: 使用GPT-2的师生设置进行系统性研究，分析潜藏污染的扩展规律、阈值和机制。通过实验观察行为交叉、相变阈值和可解释性分析来理解污染过程。

Result: 实验发现三个关键结果：(1)潜藏污染导致行为交叉，不仅影响目标特征，还降低模型的整体对齐性；(2)对齐性在污染数据达到临界阈值时发生急剧相变，而非逐渐退化；(3)可解释性分析显示污染机制模仿模型的自然微调过程，难以检测。

Conclusion: 这些结果表明依赖合成数据的AI系统存在关键漏洞，需要能够考虑潜在威胁的新安全协议。

Abstract: As machine learning models are increasingly fine-tuned on synthetic data,
there is a critical risk of subtle misalignments spreading through
interconnected AI systems. This paper investigates subliminal corruption, which
we define as undesirable traits are transmitted through semantically neutral
data, bypassing standard safety checks. While this phenomenon has been
identified, a quantitative understanding of its dynamics is missing. To address
this gap, we present a systematic study of the scaling laws, thresholds, and
mechanisms of subliminal corruption using a teacher-student setup with GPT-2.
Our experiments reveal three key findings: (1) subliminal corruption causes
behavioral crossover, degrading the model's overall alignment, not just the
targeted trait; (2) alignment fails in a sharp phase transition at a critical
threshold of poisoned data, rather than degrading gradually; and (3)
interpretability analysis shows the corruption mechanism mimics the model's
natural fine-tuning process, making it difficult to detect. These results
demonstrate a critical vulnerability in AI systems that rely on synthetic data
and highlight the need for new safety protocols that can account for latent
threats.

Motivation: 解决参数高效微调方法在权重空间操作时过度专业化、覆盖预训练知识的问题，以及在下游数据有限或与预训练分布差异大时的灾难性遗忘问题。

Method: 在特征空间进行微调，提出LoRFA（低秩特征适应）和VeFA（基于向量的特征适应），基于效应等价建模理论补偿下游潜伏变量的影响。

Result: 在图像分类、自然语言理解和生成任务上，特征空间适应方法达到可比的微调结果，并在鲁棒性方面表现更优。

Conclusion: 特征空间适应能有效保留预训练表示，提升模型在分布偏移下的泛化能力，相比权重空间方法具有更强的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Catastrophic forgetting is a common issue in model fine-tuning, especially
when the downstream domain contains limited labeled data or differs greatly
from the pre-training distribution. Existing parameter-efficient fine-tuning
methods operate in the weight space by modifying or augmenting the pre-trained
model's parameters, which can yield models overly specialized to the available
downstream data. To mitigate the risk of overwriting pre-trained knowledge and
enhance robustness, we propose to fine-tune the pre-trained model in the
feature space. Two new fine-tuning methods are proposed: LoRFA (Low-Rank
Feature Adaptation) and VeFA (Vector-Based Feature Adaptation). Feature space
adaptation is inspired by the idea of effect equivalence modeling (EEM) of
downstream lurking variables causing distribution shifts, which posits that
unobserved factors can be represented as the total equivalent amount on
observed features. By compensating for the effects of downstream lurking
variables via a lightweight feature-level transformation, the pre-trained
representations can be preserved, which improves model generalization under
distribution shift. We evaluate LoRFA and VeFA versus LoRA on image
classification, NLU, and NLG, covering both standard fine-tuning metrics and
robustness. Feature space adaptation achieves comparable fine-tuning results
and consistently stronger robustness.

Conclusion: 该模型涵盖了新旧部分信息设置，在某些有趣情况下对游戏结构的依赖可以达到紧致性。

Abstract: In contrast to the classic formulation of partial monitoring, linear partial
monitoring can model infinite outcome spaces, while imposing a linear structure
on both the losses and the observations. This setting can be viewed as a
generalization of linear bandits where loss and feedback are decoupled in a
flexible manner. In this work, we address a nonstochastic (adversarial),
finite-actions version of the problem through a simple instance of the
exploration-by-optimization method that is amenable to efficient
implementation. We derive regret bounds that depend on the game structure in a
more transparent manner than previous theoretical guarantees for this paradigm.
Our bounds feature instance-specific quantities that reflect the degree of
alignment between observations and losses, and resemble known guarantees in the
stochastic setting. Notably, they achieve the standard $\sqrt{T}$ rate in easy
(locally observable) games and $T^{2/3}$ in hard (globally observable) games,
where $T$ is the time horizon. We instantiate these bounds in a selection of
old and new partial information settings subsumed by this model, and illustrate
that the achieved dependence on the game structure can be tight in interesting
cases.

vision-language model (VLM) that encodes videos with text input in order to
classify various behaviors of a mouse existing in and engaging with their
environment. Importantly, this model produces a behavioral vector over time for
each subject and for each session the subject undergoes. The output is a
valuable dataset that few programs are able to produce with as high accuracy
and with minimal user input. Specifically, we use the open-source Qwen2.5-VL
model and enhance its performance through prompts, in-context learning (ICL)
with labeled examples, and frame-level preprocessing. We found that each of
these methods contributes to improved classification, and that combining them
results in strong F1 scores across all behaviors, including rare classes like
freezing and fleeing, without any model fine-tuning. Overall, this model will
support interdisciplinary researchers studying mouse behavior by enabling them
to integrate diverse behavioral features, measured across multiple time points
and environments, into a comprehensive dataset that can address complex
research questions.

*Fangyuan Sun,Ilyas Fatkhullin,Niao He*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文对随机自然梯度变分推断(NGVI)在非共轭似然情况下的理论分析进行了深入研究，提出了相对平滑性条件，设计了改进的NGVI算法，并建立了收敛性保证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管NGVI在经验上很成功，但其理论基础仍然有限，特别是在非共轭似然的情况下。现有收敛性保证仅适用于共轭模型，无法扩展到非共轭设置，其中变分损失变得非凸且难以分析。

Method: 针对均值场参数化，首先推导了变分损失满足相对平滑性的充分条件；其次提出了结合非欧几里得投影的改进NGVI算法；最后在额外结构假设下揭示了变分损失的隐藏凸性。

Result: 证明了改进NGVI算法到驻点的全局非渐近收敛性，并在特定条件下建立了到全局最优解的快速全局收敛性。

Conclusion: 这些结果为NGVI在挑战性推断设置中的几何结构和收敛行为提供了新的理论见解。

Abstract: Stochastic Natural Gradient Variational Inference (NGVI) is a widely used
method for approximating posterior distribution in probabilistic models.
Despite its empirical success and foundational role in variational inference,
its theoretical underpinnings remain limited, particularly in the case of
non-conjugate likelihoods. While NGVI has been shown to be a special instance
of Stochastic Mirror Descent, and recent work has provided convergence
guarantees using relative smoothness and strong convexity for conjugate models,
these results do not extend to the non-conjugate setting, where the variational
loss becomes non-convex and harder to analyze. In this work, we focus on
mean-field parameterization and advance the theoretical understanding of NGVI
in three key directions. First, we derive sufficient conditions under which the
variational loss satisfies relative smoothness with respect to a suitable
mirror map. Second, leveraging this structure, we propose a modified NGVI
algorithm incorporating non-Euclidean projections and prove its global
non-asymptotic convergence to a stationary point. Finally, under additional
structural assumptions about the likelihood, we uncover hidden convexity
properties of the variational loss and establish fast global convergence of
NGVI to a global optimum. These results provide new insights into the geometry
and convergence behavior of NGVI in challenging inference settings.

TL;DR: 研究发现多任务后训练中梯度不平衡问题：某些任务产生显著更大的梯度，导致优化偏向这些任务，但大梯度并不一定带来更大的学习收益。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多任务后训练通常假设所有任务贡献相似大小的梯度，但本文发现这一假设在强化学习后训练中不成立，梯度不平衡会导致优化偏差。

Method: 通过分析不同任务在RL后训练中的梯度大小和学习收益，研究梯度不平衡现象及其与训练统计量的关系。

Result: 发现大梯度任务可能获得相似或更低的学习收益，且梯度不平衡不能由训练奖励或优势等典型统计量解释，表明其源于任务间的固有差异。

Conclusion: 警告不要简单混合数据集，呼吁未来研究开发基于梯度的修正方法来解决LLM中的梯度不平衡问题。

Abstract: Multi-task post-training of large language models (LLMs) is typically
performed by mixing datasets from different tasks and optimizing them jointly.
This approach implicitly assumes that all tasks contribute gradients of similar
magnitudes; when this assumption fails, optimization becomes biased toward
large-gradient tasks. In this paper, however, we show that this assumption
fails in RL post-training: certain tasks produce significantly larger
gradients, thus biasing updates toward those tasks. Such gradient imbalance
would be justified only if larger gradients implied larger learning gains on
the tasks (i.e., larger performance improvements) -- but we find this is not
true. Large-gradient tasks can achieve similar or even much lower learning
gains than small-gradient ones. Further analyses reveal that these gradient
imbalances cannot be explained by typical training statistics such as training
rewards or advantages, suggesting that they arise from the inherent differences
between tasks. This cautions against naive dataset mixing and calls for future
work on principled gradient-level corrections for LLMs.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多智能体系统中通信受限的问题，降低通信开销同时维持系统协调性。

Method: 采用去中心化的actor-critic学习框架，每个智能体在本地多次更新策略和价值函数（使用多层神经网络近似），然后与邻居交换信息。

Result: 在马尔可夫采样下建立了有限时间收敛分析：样本复杂度为O(ε⁻³)，通信复杂度为O(ε⁻¹τ⁻¹)，其中τ为本地训练步数。

Conclusion: 该框架在减少通信负担的同时保持了协调性，数值实验验证了理论结果的有效性。

Abstract: In this paper, we study the problem of reinforcement learning in multi-agent
systems where communication among agents is limited. We develop a decentralized
actor-critic learning framework in which each agent performs several local
updates of its policy and value function, where the latter is approximated by a
multi-layer neural network, before exchanging information with its neighbors.
This local training strategy substantially reduces the communication burden
while maintaining coordination across the network. We establish finite-time
convergence analysis for the algorithm under Markov-sampling. Specifically, to
attain the $\varepsilon$-accurate stationary point, the sample complexity is of
order $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-3})$ and the communication complexity is of
order $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-1}\tau^{-1})$, where tau denotes the number of
local training steps. We also show how the final error bound depends on the
neural network's approximation quality. Numerical experiments in a cooperative
control setting illustrate and validate the theoretical findings.

Conclusion: ADGNN通过主动扩散机制成功克服了传统扩散方法的局限性，在保持节点特征独特性的同时获得对图全局结构的全面洞察。

Abstract: The analogy to heat diffusion has enhanced our understanding of information
flow in graphs and inspired the development of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs).
However, most diffusion-based GNNs emulate passive heat diffusion, which still
suffers from over-smoothing and limits their ability to capture global graph
information. Inspired by the heat death of the universe, which posits that
energy distribution becomes uniform over time in a closed system, we recognize
that, without external input, node representations in a graph converge to
identical feature vectors as diffusion progresses. To address this issue, we
propose the Active Diffusion-based Graph Neural Network (ADGNN). ADGNN achieves
active diffusion by integrating multiple external information sources that
dynamically influence the diffusion process, effectively overcoming the
over-smoothing problem. Furthermore, our approach realizes true infinite
diffusion by directly calculating the closed-form solution of the active
diffusion iterative formula. This allows nodes to preserve their unique
characteristics while efficiently gaining comprehensive insights into the
graph's global structure. We evaluate ADGNN against several state-of-the-art
GNN models across various graph tasks. The results demonstrate that ADGNN
significantly improves both accuracy and efficiency, highlighting its
effectiveness in capturing global graph information and maintaining node
distinctiveness.

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) techniques have emerged as a powerful tool for
transferring expertise from complex teacher models to lightweight student
models, particularly beneficial for deploying high-performance models in
resource-constrained devices. This approach has been successfully applied to
graph neural networks (GNNs), harnessing their expressive capabilities to
generate node embeddings that capture structural and feature-related
information. In this study, we depart from the conventional KD approach by
exploring the potential of collaborative learning among GNNs. In the absence of
a pre-trained teacher model, we show that relatively simple and shallow GNN
architectures can synergetically learn efficient models capable of performing
better during inference, particularly in tackling multiple tasks. We propose a
collaborative learning framework where ensembles of student GNNs mutually teach
each other throughout the training process. We introduce an adaptive logit
weighting unit to facilitate efficient knowledge exchange among models and an
entropy enhancement technique to improve mutual learning. These components
dynamically empower the models to adapt their learning strategies during
training, optimizing their performance for downstream tasks. Extensive
experiments conducted on three datasets each for node and graph classification
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

Motivation: 传统近似遗忘方法作为单目标优化问题面临三个主要挑战：过度遗忘风险、缺乏细粒度控制、缺少全面评估权衡的指标。

Method: 提出CUP算法，采用独特的枢轴梯度机制，能够可控地导航整个帕累托前沿，通过单一超参数"遗忘强度"精确选择期望的权衡点。

Conclusion: 将机器遗忘重新定义为多目标优化问题，并通过CUP算法实现了对遗忘过程的可控导航，解决了传统方法的局限性。

Abstract: Machine unlearning (MU) aims to remove the influence of specific data from a
trained model. However, approximate unlearning methods, often formulated as a
single-objective optimization (SOO) problem, face a critical trade-off between
unlearning efficacy and model fidelity. This leads to three primary challenges:
the risk of over-forgetting, a lack of fine-grained control over the unlearning
process, and the absence of metrics to holistically evaluate the trade-off. To
address these issues, we reframe MU as a multi-objective optimization (MOO)
problem. We then introduce a novel algorithm, Controllable Unlearning by
Pivoting Gradient (CUP), which features a unique pivoting mechanism. Unlike
traditional MOO methods that converge to a single solution, CUP's mechanism is
designed to controllably navigate the entire Pareto frontier. This navigation
is governed by a single intuitive hyperparameter, the `unlearning intensity',
which allows for precise selection of a desired trade-off. To evaluate this
capability, we adopt the hypervolume indicator, a metric that captures both the
quality and diversity of the entire set of solutions an algorithm can generate.
Our experimental results demonstrate that CUP produces a superior set of
Pareto-optimal solutions, consistently outperforming existing methods across
various vision tasks.

Abstract: Infants discover categories, detect novelty, and adapt to new contexts
without supervision -- a challenge for current machine learning. We present a
brain-inspired perspective on configurations, a finite-resolution clustering
framework that uses a single resolution parameter and attraction-repulsion
dynamics to yield hierarchical organization, novelty sensitivity, and flexible
adaptation. To evaluate these properties, we introduce mheatmap, which provides
proportional heatmaps and a reassignment algorithm to fairly assess
multi-resolution and dynamic behavior. Across datasets, configurations are
competitive on standard clustering metrics, achieve 87% AUC in novelty
detection, and show 35% better stability during dynamic category evolution.
These results position configurations as a principled computational model of
early cognitive categorization and a step toward brain-inspired AI.

Abstract: Time series foundation models (TSFMs) are a class of potentially powerful,
general-purpose tools for time series forecasting and related temporal tasks,
but their behavior is strongly shaped by subtle inductive biases in their
design. Rather than developing a new model and claiming that it is better than
existing TSFMs, e.g., by winning on existing well-established benchmarks, our
objective is to understand how the various ``knobs'' of the training process
affect model quality. Using a mix of theory and controlled empirical
evaluation, we identify several design choices (patch size, embedding choice,
training objective, etc.) and show how they lead to implicit biases in
fundamental model properties (temporal behavior, geometric structure, how
aggressively or not the model regresses to the mean, etc.); and we show how
these biases can be intuitive or very counterintuitive, depending on properties
of the model and data. We also illustrate in a case study on outlier handling
how multiple biases can interact in complex ways; and we discuss implications
of our results for learning the bitter lesson and building TSFMs.

TL;DR: SPOT是一种新颖的决策树策略计算方法，通过混合整数线性规划优化MDP中的决策树策略，显著提高了运行效率和可扩展性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在高风险决策中，可解释的强化学习策略至关重要，但在MDP中优化决策树策略仍然具有挑战性。

Method: 将优化问题建模为混合整数线性规划，采用缩减空间的分支定界方法，将MDP动态与树结构约束解耦，实现高效并行搜索。

Result: 在标准基准测试中，SPOT实现了显著加速，可扩展到状态数更多的更大MDP，生成的可解释决策树策略紧凑且保持性能。

Conclusion: 该方法同时实现了可解释性和可扩展性，比现有方法快一个数量级地提供高质量策略。

Abstract: Interpretable reinforcement learning policies are essential for high-stakes
decision-making, yet optimizing decision tree policies in Markov Decision
Processes (MDPs) remains challenging. We propose SPOT, a novel method for
computing decision tree policies, which formulates the optimization problem as
a mixed-integer linear program (MILP). To enhance efficiency, we employ a
reduced-space branch-and-bound approach that decouples the MDP dynamics from
tree-structure constraints, enabling efficient parallel search. This
significantly improves runtime and scalability compared to previous methods.
Our approach ensures that each iteration yields the optimal decision tree.
Experimental results on standard benchmarks demonstrate that SPOT achieves
substantial speedup and scales to larger MDPs with a significantly higher
number of states. The resulting decision tree policies are interpretable and
compact, maintaining transparency without compromising performance. These
results demonstrate that our approach simultaneously achieves interpretability
and scalability, delivering high-quality policies an order of magnitude faster
than existing approaches.

<details>

Motivation: 深度强化学习虽然性能出色但缺乏可解释性，限制了对其策略行为的信任。现有的SILVER框架仅限于低维、二元动作领域。

Method: 从图像观察中提取紧凑特征表示，执行SHAP特征归因，然后使用RL引导标记生成行为一致的边界数据集，训练决策树和回归函数等替代模型来解释RL策略决策结构。

Result: 在两个Atari环境中使用三种深度RL算法进行评估，并进行人类主体研究。结果显示该方法在保持竞争性任务性能的同时，显著提高了透明度和人类对智能体行为的理解。

Conclusion: 这项工作通过将SILVER转化为可扩展且行为感知的框架，在高维多动作设置中解释深度RL智能体，推进了可解释强化学习的发展。

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (RL) achieves remarkable performance but lacks
interpretability, limiting trust in policy behavior. The existing SILVER
framework (Li, Siddique, and Cao 2025) explains RL policy via Shapley-based
regression but remains restricted to low-dimensional, binary-action domains. We
propose SILVER with RL-guided labeling, an enhanced variant that extends SILVER
to multi-action and high-dimensional environments by incorporating the RL
policy's own action outputs into the boundary points identification. Our method
first extracts compact feature representations from image observations,
performs SHAP-based feature attribution, and then employs RL-guided labeling to
generate behaviorally consistent boundary datasets. Surrogate models, such as
decision trees and regression-based functions, are subsequently trained to
interpret RL policy's decision structure. We evaluate the proposed framework on
two Atari environments using three deep RL algorithms and conduct human-subject
study to assess the clarity and trustworthiness of the derived interpretable
policy. Results show that our approach maintains competitive task performance
while substantially improving transparency and human understanding of agent
behavior. This work advances explainable RL by transforming SILVER into a
scalable and behavior-aware framework for interpreting deep RL agents in
high-dimensional, multi-action settings.

Abstract: Humans possess an innate ability to group objects by similarity, a cognitive
mechanism that clustering algorithms aim to emulate. Recent advances in
community detection have enabled the discovery of configurations -- valid
hierarchical clusterings across multiple resolution scales -- without requiring
labeled data. In this paper, we formally characterize these configurations and
identify similar emergent structures in register tokens within Vision
Transformers. Unlike register tokens, configurations exhibit lower redundancy
and eliminate the need for ad hoc selection. They can be learned through
unsupervised or self-supervised methods, yet their selection or composition
remains specific to the downstream task and input. Building on these insights,
we introduce GraMixC, a plug-and-play module that extracts configurations,
aligns them using our Reverse Merge/Split (RMS) technique, and fuses them via
attention heads before forwarding them to any downstream predictor. On the DSN1
16S rRNA cultivation-media prediction task, GraMixC improves the R2 score from
0.6 to 0.9 across multiple methods, setting a new state of the art. We further
validate GraMixC on standard tabular benchmarks, where it consistently
outperforms single-resolution and static-feature baselines.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) excel at learning from structured data, yet

target classification and representation-level debiasing, which cannot fully
address the continuous nature of node-level regression. We propose FnRGNN, a
fairness-aware in-processing framework for GNN-based node regression that
applies interventions at three levels: (i) structure-level edge reweighting,
(ii) representation-level alignment via MMD, and (iii) prediction-level
normalization through Sinkhorn-based distribution matching. This multi-level
strategy ensures robust fairness under complex graph topologies. Experiments on
four real-world datasets demonstrate that FnRGNN reduces group disparities
without sacrificing performance. Code is available at

Conclusion: 注意力知识可以有效迁移到循环模型中，为快速利用Transformer专业知识构建更强的SSM社区提供了可行方案。

Abstract: State-space models (SSMs) have emerged as efficient alternatives to
Transformers for sequence modeling, offering superior scalability through
recurrent structures. However, their training remains costly and the ecosystem
around them is far less mature than that of Transformers. Moreover, the
structural heterogeneity between SSMs and Transformers makes it challenging to
efficiently distill knowledge from pretrained attention models. In this work,
we propose Cross-architecture distillation via Attention Bridge (CAB), a novel
data-efficient distillation framework that efficiently transfers attention
knowledge from Transformer teachers to state-space student models. Unlike
conventional knowledge distillation that transfers knowledge only at the output
level, CAB enables token-level supervision via a lightweight bridge and
flexible layer-wise alignment, improving both efficiency and transferability.
We further introduce flexible layer-wise alignment strategies to accommodate
architectural discrepancies between teacher and student. Extensive experiments
across vision and language domains demonstrate that our method consistently
improves the performance of state-space models, even under limited training
data, outperforming both standard and cross-architecture distillation methods.
Our findings suggest that attention-based knowledge can be efficiently
transferred to recurrent models, enabling rapid utilization of Transformer
expertise for building a stronger SSM community.

Conclusion: 高斯蒸馏是一种有效的分布蒸馏方法，能够成功压缩集成模型同时保持不确定性量化能力。

Abstract: Deep ensembles deliver state-of-the-art, reliable uncertainty quantification,
but their heavy computational and memory requirements hinder their practical
deployments to real applications such as on-device AI. Knowledge distillation
compresses an ensemble into small student models, but existing techniques
struggle to preserve uncertainty partly because reducing the size of DNNs
typically results in variation reduction. To resolve this limitation, we
introduce a new method of distribution distillation (i.e. compressing a teacher
ensemble into a student distribution instead of a student ensemble) called
Gaussian distillation, which estimates the distribution of a teacher ensemble
through a special Gaussian process called the deep latent factor model (DLF) by
treating each member of the teacher ensemble as a realization of a certain
stochastic process. The mean and covariance functions in the DLF model are
estimated stably by using the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. By using
multiple benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that the proposed Gaussian
distillation outperforms existing baselines. In addition, we illustrate that
Gaussian distillation works well for fine-tuning of language models and
distribution shift problems.

Method: 通过比较生成模块与参考模块的信号功能正确性，提取已验证的信号感知实现；使用抽象语法树识别信号感知代码段；引入信号感知DPO在正确的信号级代码段上进行优化。

Result: 在VerilogEval和RTLLM基准测试中达到最先进性能，7B参数模型匹配DeepSeek v3 671B模型的性能，并显著优于在同一数据集上训练的开源模型CodeV。

Conclusion: QiMeng-SALV强调了从传统模块级到细粒度信号级优化的范式转变，解决了功能奖励不足的问题，为自动化电路设计提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The remarkable progress of Large Language Models (LLMs) presents promising
opportunities for Verilog code generation which is significantly important for
automated circuit design. The lacking of meaningful functional rewards hinders
the preference optimization based on Reinforcement Learning (RL) for producing
functionally correct Verilog code. In this paper, we propose Signal-Aware
Learning for Verilog code generation (QiMeng-SALV) by leveraging code segments
of functionally correct output signal to optimize RL training. Considering
Verilog code specifies the structural interconnection of hardware gates and
wires so that different output signals are independent, the key insight of
QiMeng-SALV is to extract verified signal-aware implementations in partially
incorrect modules, so as to enhance the extraction of meaningful functional
rewards. Roughly, we verify the functional correctness of signals in generated
module by comparing with that of reference module in the training data. Then
abstract syntax tree (AST) is employed to identify signal-aware code segments
which can provide meaningful functional rewards from erroneous modules.
Finally, we introduce signal-aware DPO which is optimized on the correct
signal-level code segments, thereby preventing noise and interference from
incorrect signals. The proposed QiMeng-SALV underscores the paradigm shift from
conventional module-level to fine-grained signal-level optimization in Verilog
code generation, addressing the issue of insufficient functional rewards.
Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance
on VerilogEval and RTLLM, with a 7B parameter model matching the performance of
the DeepSeek v3 671B model and significantly outperforming the leading
open-source model CodeV trained on the same dataset. Our code is available at

*Mingyu Jo,Jaesik Yoon,Justin Deschenaux,Caglar Gulcehre,Sungjin Ahn*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了Loopholing机制，通过确定性潜变量路径保留分布信息，解决了离散扩散模型采样时信息坍缩的问题，显著提升了文本生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 离散扩散模型在并行解码方面有优势，但存在采样墙问题：一旦进行类别采样，丰富的分布信息就会坍缩为one-hot向量，无法在步骤间传播，导致后续步骤信息受限。

Method: 引入Loopholing机制，通过确定性潜变量路径保留分布信息，采用自条件策略进行高效训练，构建Loopholing离散扩散模型(LDDMs)。

Result: 将生成困惑度降低了高达61%，缩小了与自回归模型的差距（某些情况下甚至超越），生成更连贯的文本，在Countdown和Game of 24等算术推理任务上表现更好。

Conclusion: Loopholing机制缓解了空闲步骤和振荡问题，为非自回归文本生成提供了可扩展的高质量路径。

Abstract: Discrete diffusion models offer a promising alternative to autoregressive
generation through parallel decoding, but they suffer from a sampling wall:
once categorical sampling occurs, rich distributional information collapses
into one-hot vectors and cannot be propagated across steps, forcing subsequent
steps to operate with limited information. To mitigate this problem, we
introduce Loopholing, a novel and simple mechanism that preserves this
information via a deterministic latent pathway, leading to Loopholing Discrete
Diffusion Models (LDDMs). Trained efficiently with a self-conditioning
strategy, LDDMs achieve substantial gains-reducing generative perplexity by up
to 61% over prior baselines, closing (and in some cases surpassing) the gap
with autoregressive models, and producing more coherent text. Applied to
reasoning tasks, LDDMs also improve performance on arithmetic benchmarks such
as Countdown and Game of 24. These results also indicate that loopholing
mitigates idle steps and oscillations, providing a scalable path toward
high-quality non-autoregressive text generation.

Motivation: 传统物种监测方法覆盖范围有限，需要更精确的物种分布模型来支持生物多样性保护工作。

Method: 使用深度学习和数据插补技术，结合数据平衡和特征选择，构建多模态集成模型整合土地覆盖、NDVI等环境变量。

Result: 数据平衡显著提升模型性能，多模态模型在蛙类计数任务中MAE降至29，栖息地分类准确率达84.9%，AUC为0.90。

Conclusion: 多模态学习和数据预处理技术能有效改善生态预测模型，为稀疏或不完整数据下的生物多样性监测提供更精确和可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Monitoring species distribution is vital for conservation efforts, enabling
the assessment of environmental impacts and the development of effective
preservation strategies. Traditional data collection methods, including citizen
science, offer valuable insights but remain limited in coverage and
completeness. Species Distribution Modelling (SDM) helps address these gaps by
using occurrence data and environmental variables to predict species presence
across large regions. In this study, we enhance SDM accuracy for frogs (Anura)
by applying deep learning and data imputation techniques using data from the
"EY - 2022 Biodiversity Challenge." Our experiments show that data balancing
significantly improved model performance, reducing the Mean Absolute Error
(MAE) from 189 to 29 in frog counting tasks. Feature selection identified key
environmental factors influencing occurrence, optimizing inputs while
maintaining predictive accuracy. The multimodal ensemble model, integrating
land cover, NDVI, and other environmental inputs, outperformed individual
models and showed robust generalization across unseen regions. The fusion of
image and tabular data improved both frog counting and habitat classification,
achieving 84.9% accuracy with an AUC of 0.90. This study highlights the
potential of multimodal learning and data preprocessing techniques such as
balancing and imputation to improve predictive ecological modeling when data
are sparse or incomplete, contributing to more precise and scalable
biodiversity monitoring.

Motivation: 机器学习模型在决策和风险评估中需要高度可靠的预测，校准对于临床预测等关键决策至关重要，但往往被忽视。

Method: 利用输入样本学习表示的聚类，在这些聚类上训练校准函数集成，并引入匹配度量来优化模型选择。

Conclusion: 该通用方案能适应任何底层表示、聚类、校准方法和度量，为模型校准提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Machine learning models are essential for decision-making and risk
assessment, requiring highly reliable predictions in terms of both
discrimination and calibration. While calibration often receives less
attention, it is crucial for critical decisions, such as those in clinical
predictions. We introduce a novel calibration pipeline that leverages an
ensemble of calibration functions trained on clusters of learned
representations of the input samples to enhance overall calibration. This
approach not only improves the calibration score of various methods from 82.28%
up to 100% but also introduces a unique matching metric that ensures model
selection optimizes both discrimination and calibration. Our generic scheme
adapts to any underlying representation, clustering, calibration methods and
metric, offering flexibility and superior performance across commonly used
calibration methods.

Motivation: 解决长文本推理场景下的高I/O和计算开销问题，通过混合注意力架构优化推理成本。

Method: 采用线性注意力和softmax注意力的混合架构，系统探索不同注意力机制的比例，并使用自研的高性能FP8算子库linghe提升训练效率。

Conclusion: Ring-linear模型系列通过混合注意力架构和高效算子库，在保持高性能的同时显著降低了推理和训练成本，为长文本推理提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: In this technical report, we present the Ring-linear model series,
specifically including Ring-mini-linear-2.0 and Ring-flash-linear-2.0.
Ring-mini-linear-2.0 comprises 16B parameters and 957M activations, while
Ring-flash-linear-2.0 contains 104B parameters and 6.1B activations. Both
models adopt a hybrid architecture that effectively integrates linear attention
and softmax attention, significantly reducing I/O and computational overhead in
long-context inference scenarios. Compared to a 32 billion parameter dense
model, this series reduces inference cost to 1/10, and compared to the original
Ring series, the cost is also reduced by over 50%. Furthermore, through
systematic exploration of the ratio between different attention mechanisms in
the hybrid architecture, we have identified the currently optimal model
structure. Additionally, by leveraging our self-developed high-performance FP8
operator library-linghe, overall training efficiency has been improved by 50%.
Benefiting from the high alignment between the training and inference engine
operators, the models can undergo long-term, stable, and highly efficient
optimization during the reinforcement learning phase, consistently maintaining
SOTA performance across multiple challenging complex reasoning benchmarks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文分析了时间序列基础模型(TSFMs)的预测类型与实际应用价值的关系，指出虽然这些模型在预测精度上表现良好，但预测类型(点预测、分位数预测、参数预测或轨迹集成)限制了其支持的操作任务能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前时间序列基础模型主要关注预测精度，但忽略了预测类型对实际应用价值的关键影响。许多操作任务需要轨迹集成预测来保持时间依赖性，而现有模型大多只能产生点预测或参数预测。

Method: 通过调查近期TSFMs，分析不同预测类型之间的转换可能性，证明边际分布无法确定路径依赖事件概率，并将六种基本预测任务映射到最小充分预测类型。

Result: 研究发现三分之二的TSFMs只能产生点预测或参数预测，而轨迹集成可以通过边际化转换为简单形式，但反向转换需要额外假设。建立了任务对齐的评估框架。

Conclusion: 预测类型而非精度决定了实际效用，需要根据具体操作任务选择合适的预测类型，轨迹集成对于需要时间依赖性的任务至关重要。

Abstract: Time-series foundation models (TSFMs) achieve strong forecast accuracy, yet
accuracy alone does not determine practical value. The form of a forecast --
point, quantile, parametric, or trajectory ensemble -- fundamentally constrains
which operational tasks it can support. We survey recent TSFMs and find that
two-thirds produce only point or parametric forecasts, while many operational
tasks require trajectory ensembles that preserve temporal dependence. We
establish when forecast types can be converted and when they cannot: trajectory
ensembles convert to simpler forms via marginalization without additional
assumptions, but the reverse requires imposing temporal dependence through
copulas or conformal methods. We prove that marginals cannot determine
path-dependent event probabilities -- infinitely many joint distributions share
identical marginals but yield different answers to operational questions. We
map six fundamental forecasting tasks to minimal sufficient forecast types and
provide a task-aligned evaluation framework. Our analysis clarifies when
forecast type, not accuracy, differentiates practical utility.

Motivation: 传统对抗样本是在原始样本附近添加微小扰动导致模型输出错误，本文研究相反情况：生成与原始样本显著不同但模型输出相同的样本。

Method: 提出了负迭代快速梯度符号法(NI-FGSM)、负迭代快速梯度法(NI-FGM)及其动量变体(NMI-FGSM、NMI-FGM)来生成此类对抗样本。

Result: 生成的对抗样本可用于攻击机器学习系统，且研究发现对抗样本不仅分布在数据集样本邻域，而是广泛分布于整个样本空间。

Conclusion: 对抗样本的分布范围比传统认知更广泛，新提出的方法能有效生成与原始样本显著不同但输出相同的对抗样本。

Abstract: Most machine learning models are vulnerable to adversarial examples, which
poses security concerns on these models. Adversarial examples are crafted by
applying subtle but intentionally worst-case modifications to examples from the
dataset, leading the model to output a different answer from the original
example. In this paper, adversarial examples are formed in an exactly opposite
manner, which are significantly different from the original examples but result
in the same answer. We propose a novel set of algorithms to produce such
adversarial examples, including the negative iterative fast gradient sign
method (NI-FGSM) and the negative iterative fast gradient method (NI-FGM),
along with their momentum variants: the negative momentum iterative fast
gradient sign method (NMI-FGSM) and the negative momentum iterative fast
gradient method (NMI-FGM). Adversarial examples constructed by these methods
could be used to perform an attack on machine learning systems in certain
occasions. Moreover, our results show that the adversarial examples are not
merely distributed in the neighbourhood of the examples from the dataset;
instead, they are distributed extensively in the sample space.

Method: 提出了BBMDP，一个基于标准马尔可夫决策过程的变量选择建模框架，可以应用广泛的强化学习算法来学习分支定界启发式策略。

Result: 在四个标准MILP基准测试上的计算实验表明，该方法的分支智能体性能优于现有的最先进RL智能体。

Conclusion: BBMDP提供了一个原则性的MDP建模框架，能够有效利用强化学习算法学习最优分支策略，在MILP求解中取得了优越性能。

Abstract: Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) is a powerful framework used to
address a wide range of NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems, often
solved by Branch and Bound (B&B). A key factor influencing the performance of
B&B solvers is the variable selection heuristic governing branching decisions.
Recent contributions have sought to adapt reinforcement learning (RL)
algorithms to the B&B setting to learn optimal branching policies, through
Markov Decision Processes (MDP) inspired formulations, and ad hoc convergence
theorems and algorithms. In this work, we introduce BBMDP, a principled vanilla
MDP formulation for variable selection in B&B, allowing to leverage a broad
range of RL algorithms for the purpose of learning optimal B\&B heuristics.
Computational experiments validate our model empirically, as our branching
agent outperforms prior state-of-the-art RL agents on four standard MILP
benchmarks.

Motivation: LinUCB在推荐系统中广泛应用，但其训练、推理和内存成本随特征维度和动作空间大小增长，主要瓶颈是需要更新、求逆和存储设计矩阵。

Method: 使用动态低秩参数化逆Cholesky因子，推导数值稳定的秩1和批量更新，避免直接形成整个矩阵，并采用投影器-分裂积分器控制内存增长。

Conclusion: Scalable LinUCB算法显著降低了LinUCB的计算和内存需求，使其能够扩展到高维特征和大动作空间的实际应用场景。

Abstract: Linear contextual bandits, especially LinUCB, are widely used in recommender
systems. However, its training, inference, and memory costs grow with feature
dimensionality and the size of the action space. The key bottleneck becomes the
need to update, invert and store a design matrix that absorbs contextual
information from interaction history. In this paper, we introduce Scalable
LinUCB, the algorithm that enables fast and memory efficient operations with
the inverse regularized design matrix. We achieve this through a dynamical
low-rank parametrization of its inverse Cholesky-style factors. We derive
numerically stable rank-1 and batched updates that maintain the inverse without
directly forming the entire matrix. To control memory growth, we employ a
projector-splitting integrator for dynamical low-rank approximation, yielding
average per-step update cost $O(dr)$ and memory $O(dr)$ for approximation rank
$r$. Inference complexity of the suggested algorithm is $O(dr)$ per action
evaluation. Experiments on recommender system datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of our algorithm.

Conclusion: 该框架适用于网络物理系统中安全智能导航，在严重环境失真下表现出鲁棒性，实现了隐私保护与模型性能的良好平衡。

Abstract: Data-driven inertial sequence learning has revolutionized navigation in
GPS-denied environments, offering superior odometric resolution compared to
traditional Bayesian methods. However, deep learning-based inertial tracking
systems remain vulnerable to privacy breaches that can expose sensitive
training data. \hl{Existing differential privacy solutions often compromise
model performance by introducing excessive noise, particularly in
high-frequency inertial measurements.} In this article, we propose ConvXformer,
a hybrid architecture that fuses ConvNeXt blocks with Transformer encoders in a
hierarchical structure for robust inertial navigation. We propose an efficient
differential privacy mechanism incorporating adaptive gradient clipping and
gradient-aligned noise injection (GANI) to protect sensitive information while
ensuring model performance. Our framework leverages truncated singular value
decomposition for gradient processing, enabling precise control over the
privacy-utility trade-off. Comprehensive performance evaluations on benchmark
datasets (OxIOD, RIDI, RoNIN) demonstrate that ConvXformer surpasses
state-of-the-art methods, achieving more than 40% improvement in positioning
accuracy while ensuring $(\epsilon,\delta)$-differential privacy guarantees. To
validate real-world performance, we introduce the Mech-IO dataset, collected
from the mechanical engineering building at KAIST, where intense magnetic
fields from industrial equipment induce significant sensor perturbations. This
demonstrated robustness under severe environmental distortions makes our
framework well-suited for secure and intelligent navigation in cyber-physical
systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多系统会随时间老化或退化，但传感器数据中可能没有直接反映"年龄"的信息。需要从现有传感器数据中发现能代表系统老化过程的潜在代理特征。

Method: 使用精心定义的语法生成候选公式，通过优化公式的单调性（基于Spearman秩相关系数）来发现能组合多个传感器的潜在特征。

Result: 在人工生成数据集和两个真实世界数据集上的实验表明，该方法能将单调性较低的单传感器组合成单调性高的潜在特征。在InfraWatch结构健康监测项目中，两个Spearman ρ值分别为0.13和0.09的传感器被组合成ρ值为0.95的代理特征。

Conclusion: 该方法能够发现可解释的公式，作为系统"年龄"的有效代理，即使单个传感器的单调性很低，通过组合也能获得高质量的年龄代理特征。

Abstract: Many systems in our world age, degrade or otherwise move slowly but steadily
in a certain direction. When monitoring such systems by means of sensors, one
often assumes that some form of `age' is latently present in the data, but
perhaps the available sensors do not readily provide this useful information.
The task that we study in this paper is to extract potential proxies for this
`age' from the available multi-variate time series without having clear data on
what `age' actually is. We argue that when we find a sensor, or more likely
some discovered function of the available sensors, that is sufficiently
monotonic, that function can act as the proxy we are searching for. Using a
carefully defined grammar and optimising the resulting equations in terms of
monotonicity, defined as the absolute Spearman's Rank Correlation between time
and the candidate formula, the proposed approach generates a set of candidate
features which are then fitted and assessed on monotonicity. The proposed
system is evaluated against an artificially generated dataset and two
real-world datasets. In all experiments, we show that the system is able to
combine sensors with low individual monotonicity into latent features with high
monotonicity. For the real-world dataset of InfraWatch, a structural health
monitoring project, we show that two features with individual absolute
Spearman's $\rho$ values of $0.13$ and $0.09$ can be combined into a proxy with
an absolute Spearman's $\rho$ of $0.95$. This demonstrates that our proposed
method can find interpretable equations which can serve as a proxy for the
`age' of the system.

TL;DR: ADAligner是一个动态、质量感知的图文本对齐框架，能够根据监督质量在表达性多对多和保守一对一目标之间动态调整，解决了现有图文本对齐方法在真实世界图中多对多关系和噪声监督下的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的CLIP风格图文本对齐器存在两个关键限制：假设节点和文本之间存在严格的一对一对应关系，忽略了真实世界图中固有的多对多关系；依赖静态对齐目标，无法适应不同的数据质量，在噪声监督下变得脆弱。

Method: ADAligner通过实时估计批次级别的对齐可靠性并相应调整优化策略，在监督干净时促进软性的子图级别多对多对齐，在噪声情况下通过动态过滤低置信度对来强调可靠的一对一对齐。

Result: 在九个不同的TAG数据集上的综合实验表明，ADAligner在零样本/少样本节点分类、链接预测和跨模态检索任务上持续优于先前的图文本对齐器，在噪声监督下保持强鲁棒性，并且相比多模态基线加速预训练约2到3倍。

Conclusion: ADAligner为真实世界网络环境中的图文本表示学习建立了可扩展且可靠的基础，通过动态质量感知机制解决了图文本对齐中的核心困境。

Abstract: Pre-training Graph Foundation Models (GFMs) on text-attributed graphs (TAGs)
is central to web-scale applications such as search, recommendation, and
knowledge discovery. However, existing CLIP-style graph-text aligners face two
key limitations: they assume strict one-to-one correspondences between nodes
and texts, overlooking the inherent many-to-many relations in real-world
graphs; and they rely on static alignment objectives that cannot adapt to
varying data quality, making them brittle under noisy supervision. Together,
these limitations expose a core dilemma: embracing expressive many-to-many
alignment amplifies noise, while reverting to strict one-to-one strategies
sacrifices semantic diversity and fails to handle inherently mismatched pairs.
To address these challenges, we propose ADAligner, a dynamic, quality-aware
graph-text alignment framework that dynamically adjusts between expressive
many-to-many and conservative one-to-one objectives according to supervision
quality. ADAligner estimates batch-level alignment reliability in real time and
adapts its optimization accordingly, promoting soft, subgraph-level
many-to-many alignment when supervision is clean, while emphasizing reliable
one-to-one alignment by dynamically filtering low-confidence pairs under noise.
Theoretically, we prove that this dynamic mechanism forms a stable negative
feedback process, ensuring convergence and robustness. Comprehensive
experiments on nine diverse TAG datasets demonstrate that ADAligner
consistently outperforms prior graph-text aligners on zero-/few-shot node
classification, link prediction and cross-modal retrieval tasks. It maintains
strong robustness under noisy supervision and accelerates pre-training by
approximately 2 to 3 times compared to multimodal baselines, establishing a
scalable and reliable foundation for graph-text representation learning in
real-world web environments.

Motivation: 现有SVD方法将整个参数矩阵统一处理，忽略了不同矩阵部分的SVD近似误差差异很大，导致压缩效果不理想。

Method: CPSVD识别并直接保留高分解误差的矩阵列，仅对低分解误差列应用SVD，精确确定两种策略的最佳平衡点，并自适应分配非均匀压缩率。

Conclusion: CPSVD通过智能矩阵分割和自适应压缩率分配，显著提升了SVD在LLM压缩中的性能。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) faces a critical
bottleneck in their immense size, necessitating efficient compression
techniques. While Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) is a promising approach,
existing SVD-based methods treat the entire parameter matrix uniformly,
overlooking that SVD approximation errors vary significantly across different
matrix parts, which often leads to suboptimal compression. To address this, we
propose \textbf{C}olumn-\textbf{P}reserving \textbf{S}ingular \textbf{V}alue
\textbf{D}ecomposition (CPSVD), a novel method that refines SVD-based LLM
compression by intelligently segmenting the parameter matrix. Unlike
traditional SVD, CPSVD identifies and directly preserves matrix columns with
high decomposition errors, applying SVD only to columns with low decomposition
errors, while precisely determining the optimal balance point between these two
strategies to minimize error. Furthermore, leveraging the inherent
heterogeneity in decomposition errors across different matrices within an LLM,
CPSVD adaptively allocates non-uniform compression rates to modules within that
layer, while adhering to a target layer-wise compression ratio, thereby further
enhancing compression performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CPSVD
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art SVD-based LLM compression methods,
achieving lower perplexity and higher accuracy on zero-shot tasks.

*Lin Xv,Jingsheng Gao,Xian Gao,Ting Liu,Yuzhuo Fu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种自适应秩分配(ARA)方法，用于解决大语言模型SVD压缩中的秩分配问题，通过专用掩码设计和额外损失函数实现全局最优解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SVD压缩方法存在局限性：启发式算法搜索空间受限，基于掩码的训练难以有效捕获奇异值谱与可训练参数关系，且忽略增益函数在压缩比为1时的非平滑特性，导致训练陷入局部最优。

Method: ARA方法包含：(1)专用掩码设计，实现保留秩与可训练参数之间的高效映射和更新；(2)额外损失函数，引导参数选择趋向全局最优解。

Result: 在LLaMA2-7B模型上，80%压缩比下，WikiText2困惑度从8.38降至6.42，零样本任务平均准确率相比均匀压缩提升9.72个百分点。

Conclusion: ARA方法在SVD基LLM压缩中实现了最先进的秩分配性能，验证了该方法的有效性。

Abstract: In the field of large language model (LLM) compression, singular value
decomposition (SVD) is a widely studied and adopted low-rank decomposition
technique. Since SVD operates exclusively on linear modules, and these modules
in LLMs are separated by nonlinear components, SVD can only be applied
independently to each linear module. Under a global compression ratio
constraint, determining the appropriate rank for different linear modules
becomes a critical problem. Existing approaches, such as heuristic algorithms
and mask-based training, have made progress in addressing this challenge.
However, these methods still suffer from several limitations: heuristic
algorithms explore the solution space within restricted regions, while
mask-based training struggles to efficiently capture the relationship between
singular value spectra and trainable parameters. More importantly, current
methods overlook the key property that the gain function is non-smooth at a
compression ratio of 1, which often leads the training process to suboptimal
local minima. To address these issues, we propose an Adaptive Rank Allocation
(ARA) method. Specifically, (1) ARA introduces a dedicated mask design that
enables efficient mapping and updating between retained ranks and trainable
parameters; and (2) it employs an additional loss function to guide parameter
selection toward globally optimal solutions. Experimental results demonstrate
that ARA achieves state-of-the-art performance. On the LLaMA2-7B model with a
80\% compression ratio, ARA reduces perplexity on WikiText2 from 8.38 to 6.42
and improves average zero-shot task accuracy by 9.72 percentage points compared
with uniform compression. These results highlight the effectiveness of our
method for rank allocation in SVD-based LLM compression.

TL;DR: 提出了IFeF-PINN算法，通过傅里叶增强特征迭代训练PINN，解决了谱偏差问题，能准确逼近高频PDE。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决物理信息神经网络(PINN)中谱偏差问题，即神经网络倾向于先学习低频特征，难以处理高频偏微分方程。

Method: 使用随机傅里叶特征丰富潜在空间，创建两阶段训练：估计特征空间基函数，回归确定增强基函数系数。对于线性模型，证明该迭代训练方案收敛。

Result: 通过经典基准问题广泛数值评估，显示该方法优于最先进算法，在频域内实现了改进的逼近能力。

Conclusion: 随机傅里叶特征增强了网络表达能力，能准确逼近高频PDE，IFeF-PINN算法在克服谱偏差方面表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Spectral bias, the tendency of neural networks to learn low-frequency
features first, is a well-known issue with many training algorithms for
physics-informed neural networks (PINNs). To overcome this issue, we propose
IFeF-PINN, an algorithm for iterative training of PINNs with Fourier-enhanced
features. The key idea is to enrich the latent space using high-frequency
components through Random Fourier Features. This creates a two-stage training
problem: (i) estimate a basis in the feature space, and (ii) perform regression
to determine the coefficients of the enhanced basis functions. For an
underlying linear model, it is shown that the latter problem is convex, and we
prove that the iterative training scheme converges. Furthermore, we empirically
establish that Random Fourier Features enhance the expressive capacity of the
network, enabling accurate approximation of high-frequency PDEs. Through
extensive numerical evaluation on classical benchmark problems, the superior
performance of our method over state-of-the-art algorithms is shown, and the
improved approximation across the frequency domain is illustrated.

*Songqi Zhou,Zeyuan Liu,Benben Jiang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FairNet是一个新颖的动态实例级公平性校正框架，通过集成偏置检测器和条件低秩适配(LoRA)，选择性地对识别为有偏见的实例进行公平性校正，同时保持无偏见实例的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有去偏方法通常会在性能上妥协，依赖静态校正策略，难以处理数据稀疏问题（特别是在少数群体中），且对敏感属性的利用不够优化。

Method: FairNet结合偏置检测器和条件LoRA，使用新的对比损失函数训练LoRA模块，旨在最小化不同敏感群体间的类内表示差异，并能灵活处理完整、部分或完全缺失的敏感属性标签。

Result: 理论分析表明，在偏置检测器具有中等TPR/FPR的情况下，FairNet能够提升最差群体的性能而不降低整体模型性能，甚至可能带来轻微的性能提升。

Conclusion: 在多种视觉和语言基准测试上的综合实证评估验证了FairNet的有效性。

Abstract: Ensuring fairness in machine learning models is a critical challenge.
Existing debiasing methods often compromise performance, rely on static
correction strategies, and struggle with data sparsity, particularly within
minority groups. Furthermore, their utilization of sensitive attributes is
often suboptimal, either depending excessively on complete attribute labeling
or disregarding these attributes entirely. To overcome these limitations, we
propose FairNet, a novel framework for dynamic, instance-level fairness
correction. FairNet integrates a bias detector with conditional low-rank
adaptation (LoRA), which enables selective activation of the fairness
correction mechanism exclusively for instances identified as biased, and
thereby preserve performance on unbiased instances. A key contribution is a new
contrastive loss function for training the LoRA module, specifically designed
to minimize intra-class representation disparities across different sensitive
groups and effectively address underfitting in minority groups. The FairNet
framework can flexibly handle scenarios with complete, partial, or entirely
absent sensitive attribute labels. Theoretical analysis confirms that, under
moderate TPR/FPR for the bias detector, FairNet can enhance the performance of
the worst group without diminishing overall model performance, and potentially
yield slight performance improvements. Comprehensive empirical evaluations
across diverse vision and language benchmarks validate the effectiveness of
FairNet.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的语言模型遗忘方法，通过联合抑制目标响应和模型信念来对抗梯度上升方法导致的概率质量挤压效应，实现更彻底的遗忘。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有遗忘方法依赖梯度上升来降低特定目标响应的概率，但这会导致概率质量被重新分配到高似然区域（即语义相关的改写），产生虚假遗忘问题。

Method: 提出引导框架（BS），将挤压效应与模型自身高置信度生成（模型信念）联系起来。BS-T抑制高概率标记，BS-S移除整个高置信度生成序列，联合抑制目标响应和模型信念。

Result: 在多种基准测试和模型家族上的广泛实验证实了该方法的有效性，能够实现更彻底的遗忘同时保持实用性。

Conclusion: 通过直接针对挤压效应并利用模型信念，提出的引导框架能够更有效地实现语言模型的安全遗忘，解决了现有方法中的虚假遗忘问题。

Abstract: Large language models trained on vast corpora inherently risk memorizing
sensitive or harmful content, which may later resurface in their outputs.
Prevailing unlearning methods generally rely on gradient ascent and its
variants to lower the probability of specific target responses. However, we
find that this strategy induces a critical side effect: probability mass is
redistributed into high-likelihood regions, often corresponding to semantically
related rephrasings of the targets. We refer to this as the squeezing effect,
which explains why many methods yield merely spurious unlearning, a problem
further obscured by automated metrics (e.g., ROUGE, truth ratio) that misreport
actual success. To address this, we propose a bootstrapping (BS) framework that
explicitly links the squeezing effect with the model's own high-confidence
generations, namely its model beliefs. Since model beliefs inherently capture
the very high-likelihood regions where probability mass is squeezed,
incorporating them into the unlearning objective directly counters the
squeezing effect. By jointly suppressing both target responses and model
beliefs, BS-T (token) attenuates high-probability tokens, whereas BS-S
(sequence) removes entire high-confidence generations, together achieving more
thorough forgetting while preserving utility. Extensive experiments across
diverse benchmarks with various model families confirm the effectiveness of our
approach.

Motivation: 学习推断条件后验模型是鲁棒元学习的关键步骤，需要解决多任务少样本学习中的功能模糊性和不确定性。

Method: 使用基于任务特定丢弃的低秩伯努利专家元模型，通过少量观察上下文高效映射丢弃率，并利用基于整个任务数据的新颖先验优化条件丢弃后验。

Result: 在1D随机回归、图像修复和分类等少样本学习任务中，NVDPs相比其他元学习方法表现出卓越性能。

Conclusion: NVDPs能够稳健地近似任务特定的丢弃率，有效处理广泛的功能模糊性和不确定性，为少样本学习提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Learning to infer the conditional posterior model is a key step for robust
meta-learning. This paper presents a new Bayesian meta-learning approach called
Neural Variational Dropout Processes (NVDPs). NVDPs model the conditional
posterior distribution based on a task-specific dropout; a low-rank product of
Bernoulli experts meta-model is utilized for a memory-efficient mapping of
dropout rates from a few observed contexts. It allows for a quick
reconfiguration of a globally learned and shared neural network for new tasks
in multi-task few-shot learning. In addition, NVDPs utilize a novel prior
conditioned on the whole task data to optimize the conditional \textit{dropout}
posterior in the amortized variational inference. Surprisingly, this enables
the robust approximation of task-specific dropout rates that can deal with a
wide range of functional ambiguities and uncertainties. We compared the
proposed method with other meta-learning approaches in the few-shot learning
tasks such as 1D stochastic regression, image inpainting, and classification.
The results show the excellent performance of NVDPs.

Motivation: 重新验证Jones等人提出的对抗鲁棒模型普适性假说，测试其普遍适用性。

Method: 在不同数据集上测试对抗鲁棒模型的表示相似性和预测行为，分析分类层的影响，并进行分类器重训练实验。

Result: 在特定设置下验证了高表示相似性，但结果在不同数据集间不一致；预测行为不会随鲁棒性增加而收敛；不同预测源于分类层，但通过简单重训练分类器可实现更普遍的预测行为。

Conclusion: 神经网络在特定设置下具有部分普适性，但不存在严格的普适性概念。

Abstract: The modified universality hypothesis proposed by Jones et al. (2022) suggests
that adversarially robust models trained for a given task are highly similar.
We revisit the hypothesis and test its generality. While we verify Jones' main
claim of high representational similarity in specific settings, results are not
consistent across different datasets. We also discover that predictive behavior
does not converge with increasing robustness and thus is not universal. We find
that differing predictions originate in the classification layer, but show that
more universal predictive behavior can be achieved with simple retraining of
the classifiers. Overall, our work points towards partial universality of
neural networks in specific settings and away from notions of strict
universality.

TL;DR: g-DPO通过序列空间聚类和分组近似方法，解决了DPO在蛋白质语言模型训练中的可扩展性问题，在保持性能的同时显著提升了训练速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准DPO方法在蛋白质工程中面临可扩展性瓶颈，训练对数量随标记序列数量呈二次方增长，导致训练时间过长。

Method: 提出g-DPO框架：(1)使用序列空间聚类修剪冗余训练对；(2)采用基于分组的近似方法分摊似然计算。

Result: 在三个蛋白质工程任务中，g-DPO保持了与标准DPO在计算模拟和体外实验中统计上无法区分的性能，同时收敛速度提高了1.8到3.7倍。

Conclusion: g-DPO是解决DPO可扩展性问题的有效方法，随着数据集规模增大，其优势将更加明显。

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) is an effective approach for aligning
protein language models with experimental design goals. However, DPO faces a
scalability bottleneck: the number of possible training pairs grows
quadratically with the number of labeled sequences, leading to prohibitive
training times even for modestly sized datasets. We introduce g-DPO, a
framework that (i) uses sequence space clustering to prune redundant pairs
while preserving training signal, and (ii) amortizes likelihood computations
with group-based approximations. Across three protein engineering tasks, g-DPO
maintains in-silico and in-vitro performance that is statistically
indistinguishable from standard DPO, while converging 1.8 to 3.7 times faster,
with greater gains expected as the size of the dataset increases.

Conclusion: 思维链监控可能支持控制和可信度安全案例，为AI安全提供了有前景的替代方法，但仍需解决监控威胁和确保思维链忠实性。

Abstract: As AI systems approach dangerous capability levels where inability safety
cases become insufficient, we need alternative approaches to ensure safety.
This paper presents a roadmap for constructing safety cases based on
chain-of-thought (CoT) monitoring in reasoning models and outlines our research
agenda. We argue that CoT monitoring might support both control and
trustworthiness safety cases. We propose a two-part safety case: (1)
establishing that models lack dangerous capabilities when operating without
their CoT, and (2) ensuring that any dangerous capabilities enabled by a CoT
are detectable by CoT monitoring. We systematically examine two threats to
monitorability: neuralese and encoded reasoning, which we categorize into three
forms (linguistic drift, steganography, and alien reasoning) and analyze their
potential drivers. We evaluate existing and novel techniques for maintaining
CoT faithfulness. For cases where models produce non-monitorable reasoning, we
explore the possibility of extracting a monitorable CoT from a non-monitorable
CoT. To assess the viability of CoT monitoring safety cases, we establish
prediction markets to aggregate forecasts on key technical milestones
influencing their feasibility.

Conclusion: INPO框架通过减缓发散速度和增强模型效用鲁棒性，有效解决了图遗忘过程中的模型效用退化问题。

Abstract: Recent advancements in graph unlearning models have enhanced model utility by
preserving the node representation essentially invariant, while using gradient
ascent on the forget set to achieve unlearning. However, this approach causes a
drastic degradation in model utility during the unlearning process due to the
rapid divergence speed of gradient ascent. In this paper, we introduce
\textbf{INPO}, an \textbf{I}nfluence-aware \textbf{N}egative
\textbf{P}reference \textbf{O}ptimization framework that focuses on slowing the
divergence speed and improving the robustness of the model utility to the
unlearning process. Specifically, we first analyze that NPO has slower
divergence speed and theoretically propose that unlearning high-influence edges
can reduce impact of unlearning. We design an influence-aware message function
to amplify the influence of unlearned edges and mitigate the tight topological
coupling between the forget set and the retain set. The influence of each edge
is quickly estimated by a removal-based method. Additionally, we propose a
topological entropy loss from the perspective of topology to avoid excessive
information loss in the local structure during unlearning. Extensive
experiments conducted on five real-world datasets demonstrate that INPO-based
model achieves state-of-the-art performance on all forget quality metrics while
maintaining the model's utility. Codes are available at

Motivation: 在CPU边缘设备上部署大语言模型面临内存和计算资源限制的挑战，现有均匀量化方法无法很好地适应权重分布，且在低比特下反量化开销大。

Method: 提出HLQ量化格式，在不增加计算成本的情况下更好地捕捉权重统计特性，消除反量化开销，并提供优化的CPU内核用于端到端推理。

Conclusion: ELUTQ框架有效解决了边缘设备上LLM部署的内存和延迟瓶颈，实现了高效的量化推理性能。

Abstract: The deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) on CPU-based edge devices is
crucial for enabling on-device intelligence and expanding AI accessibility.
However, it remains challenging due to limited memory and computational
resources. During edge inference, memory usage and latency are the primary
bottlenecks. Although weight quantization can effectively reduce memory
consumption, existing hardware-friendly approaches often rely on uniform
quantization, which poorly fits weight distributions and incurs high
dequantization overhead at low bit widths. To address these limitations, we
propose ELUTQ, an efficient quantization framework introducing a novel
quantization format, Hierarchical Linear Quantization (HLQ). HLQ better
captures the statistical characteristics of weights without increasing the
computational cost of Bit-serial LUT-based GEMM operations, thereby eliminating
dequantization overhead. It is orthogonal to existing quantization algorithms
and can be seamlessly integrated into various quantization pipelines. For
efficient on-device deployment, ELUTQ provides optimized CPU kernels for
end-to-end inference. Experiments show that for LLaMA3-8B, HLQ reduces
perplexity by about 8% at 3-bit and 85% at 2-bit precision under post-training
quantization, completing quantization within one hour. With efficient
finetuning, HLQ further improves 2-bit performance within two hours. In terms
of inference efficiency, our 2-bit LLaMA2-7B achieves over 25 tokens/s on an
Apple M2 chip (4 threads, batch size = 1).

Conclusion: SpikeQuant为准确且节能的LLM部署提供了有效解决方案，特别适合能量受限的硬件环境。

Abstract: In the era of large language models (LLMs), weight-activation quantization
helps fit models on edge device by reducing memory and compute bit-widths.
However, three challenges persist for energy constrained hardware: (1) even
after quantization, multiply-accumulate (MAC) operations remain unavoidable and
continue to dominate energy consumption; (2) dequantization (or
per-tensor/channel rescaling) introduces extra arithmetic and data movement,
increasing latency and energy; (3) uniform parameters bit widths clip salient
values-while intra-channel mixed precision is generally impractical on current
matrix hardware and memory. In contrast, brain-inspired Spiking Neural Networks
(SNNs), owing to their binary spike-based information representation and the
Integrate-and-Fire (IF) paradigm, naturally support mixed-precision storage and
energy-efficient computation by replacing complex MACs with temporal Accumulate
(ACCs). Motivated by this property, we propose SpikeQuant, which selectively
applies mixed-precision quantization to activations with salient values and
re-encodes them into binary spike counts, thereby enabling dynamic mixed
storage of different bitwidths. Furthermore, by embedding the quantization
scale into the threshold of the IF mechanism, our approach performs
energy-efficient linear transformations on weights and activations while
avoiding explicit dequantization. Experimental results demonstrate that
SpikeQuant consistently achieves near-FP16 perplexity under W4A4 quantization
while reducing energy cost by up to 4.6 times compared to existing methods,
highlighting its effectiveness for accurate and energy-efficient LLM
deployment.

Abstract: Recent work has demonstrated state-of-the-art results in large language model
(LLM) hallucination detection and mitigation through consistency-based
approaches which involve aggregating multiple responses sampled from a single
LLM for a given prompt. These approaches help offset limitations stemming from
the imperfect data on which LLMs are trained, which includes biases and
under-representation of information required at deployment time among other
limitations which can lead to hallucinations. We show that extending these
single-model consistency methods to combine responses from multiple LLMs with
different training data, training schemes and model architectures can result in
substantial further improvements in hallucination detection and mitigation
capabilities beyond their single-model consistency counterparts. We evaluate
this \emph{consortium consistency} approach across many model teams from a pool
of 15 LLMs and explore under what conditions it is beneficial to team together
different LLMs in this manner. Further, we show that these performance
improvements often come with reduced inference costs, offsetting a significant
drawback with single-model consistency methods.

Abstract: In eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI), instance-based explanations for
time series have gained increasing attention due to their potential for
actionable and interpretable insights in domains such as healthcare. Addressing
the challenges of explainability of state-of-the-art models, we propose a
prototype-driven framework for generating sparse counterfactual explanations
tailored to 12-lead ECG classification models. Our method employs SHAP-based
thresholds to identify critical signal segments and convert them into interval
rules, uses Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) and medoid clustering to extract
representative prototypes, and aligns these prototypes to query R-peaks for
coherence with the sample being explained. The framework generates
counterfactuals that modify only 78% of the original signal while maintaining
81.3% validity across all classes and achieving 43% improvement in temporal
stability. We evaluate three variants of our approach, Original, Sparse, and
Aligned Sparse, with class-specific performance ranging from 98.9% validity for
myocardial infarction (MI) to challenges with hypertrophy (HYP) detection
(13.2%). This approach supports near realtime generation (< 1 second) of
clinically valid counterfactuals and provides a foundation for interactive
explanation platforms. Our findings establish design principles for
physiologically-aware counterfactual explanations in AI-based diagnosis systems
and outline pathways toward user-controlled explanation interfaces for clinical
deployment.

Result: 在公开基准、工业营销数据集和大规模在线A/B测试中验证了Bi-DFCL的有效性，相比最先进方法有统计显著改进，已在美团平台部署。

Conclusion: Bi-DFCL通过无偏OR估计器纠正观测数据的学习方向，实现最优偏差-方差权衡，有效解决了营销策略优化的核心挑战。

Abstract: Online Internet platforms require sophisticated marketing strategies to
optimize user retention and platform revenue -- a classical resource allocation
problem. Traditional solutions adopt a two-stage pipeline: machine learning
(ML) for predicting individual treatment effects to marketing actions, followed
by operations research (OR) optimization for decision-making. This paradigm
presents two fundamental technical challenges. First, the prediction-decision
misalignment: Conventional ML methods focus solely on prediction accuracy
without considering downstream optimization objectives, leading to improved
predictive metrics that fail to translate to better decisions. Second, the
bias-variance dilemma: Observational data suffers from multiple biases (e.g.,
selection bias, position bias), while experimental data (e.g., randomized
controlled trials), though unbiased, is typically scarce and costly --
resulting in high-variance estimates. We propose Bi-level Decision-Focused
Causal Learning (Bi-DFCL) that systematically addresses these challenges.
First, we develop an unbiased estimator of OR decision quality using
experimental data, which guides ML model training through surrogate loss
functions that bridge discrete optimization gradients. Second, we establish a
bi-level optimization framework that jointly leverages observational and
experimental data, solved via implicit differentiation. This novel formulation
enables our unbiased OR estimator to correct learning directions from biased
observational data, achieving optimal bias-variance tradeoff. Extensive
evaluations on public benchmarks, industrial marketing datasets, and
large-scale online A/B tests demonstrate the effectiveness of Bi-DFCL, showing
statistically significant improvements over state-of-the-art. Currently,
Bi-DFCL has been deployed at Meituan, one of the largest online food delivery
platforms in the world.

TL;DR: 提出REBMBO方法，结合高斯过程进行局部引导和能量基模型捕获全局结构信息，使用PPO算法实现自适应多步前瞻，有效克服传统贝叶斯优化的单步偏差问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统贝叶斯优化方法存在显著的单步偏差，容易收敛到局部最优解，在复杂或高维任务中表现不佳。黑盒优化在科学和工程领域取得成功，特别是在函数评估成本高且梯度不可用的情况下。

Method: 将贝叶斯优化迭代定义为马尔可夫决策过程，使用近端策略优化进行自适应多步前瞻，动态调整探索深度和方向。结合高斯过程提供局部引导，能量基模型捕获全局结构信息。

Result: 在合成和真实世界基准测试中进行了广泛实验，证实REBMBO具有优越性能。在不同高斯过程配置下的额外分析进一步突显了其适应性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: REBMBO通过整合高斯过程和能量基模型，结合PPO算法的自适应多步前瞻能力，有效克服了传统贝叶斯优化的局限性，在复杂优化任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Existing Bayesian Optimization (BO) methods typically balance exploration and
exploitation to optimize costly objective functions. However, these methods
often suffer from a significant one-step bias, which may lead to convergence
towards local optima and poor performance in complex or high-dimensional tasks.
Recently, Black-Box Optimization (BBO) has achieved success across various
scientific and engineering domains, particularly when function evaluations are
costly and gradients are unavailable. Motivated by this, we propose the
Reinforced Energy-Based Model for Bayesian Optimization (REBMBO), which
integrates Gaussian Processes (GP) for local guidance with an Energy-Based
Model (EBM) to capture global structural information. Notably, we define each
Bayesian Optimization iteration as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and use
Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) for adaptive multi-step lookahead,
dynamically adjusting the depth and direction of exploration to effectively
overcome the limitations of traditional BO methods. We conduct extensive
experiments on synthetic and real-world benchmarks, confirming the superior
performance of REBMBO. Additional analyses across various GP configurations
further highlight its adaptability and robustness.

Motivation: 传统基于多臂老虎机的乐观面对不确定性和汤普森采样方法在实际应用中存在局限，需要更有效的控制策略来处理未知动态的线性系统。

Method: 利用LQR策略结构、灵敏度和稳定性分析，基于混淆实例原则开发MED-LQ控制策略，扩展最小经验散度算法到大规模设置。

Result: 在综合控制套件上的基准测试表明，MED-LQ在各种场景下实现了竞争性性能，并显示出在大规模MDP中更广泛应用的潜力。

Conclusion: MED-LQ成功将混淆实例原则和MED算法扩展到线性系统控制，为大规模马尔可夫决策过程提供了有前景的方法。

Abstract: We revisit the problem of controlling linear systems with quadratic cost
under unknown dynamics with model-based reinforcement learning. Traditional
methods like Optimism in the Face of Uncertainty and Thompson Sampling, rooted
in multi-armed bandits (MABs), face practical limitations. In contrast, we
propose an alternative based on the Confusing Instance (CI) principle, which
underpins regret lower bounds in MABs and discrete Markov Decision Processes
(MDPs) and is central to the Minimum Empirical Divergence (MED) family of
algorithms, known for their asymptotic optimality in various settings. By
leveraging the structure of LQR policies along with sensitivity and stability
analysis, we develop MED-LQ. This novel control strategy extends the principles
of CI and MED beyond small-scale settings. Our benchmarks on a comprehensive
control suite demonstrate that MED-LQ achieves competitive performance in
various scenarios while highlighting its potential for broader applications in
large-scale MDPs.

Motivation: AI方法在药物发现中的应用受限于对公共数据集的依赖，而联邦学习能够整合私有数据进行隐私保护的协作训练，但联邦数据访问使得数据多样性评估等任务变得复杂。

Method: 在八个不同的分子数据集上，对三种联邦聚类方法（Fed-kMeans、Fed-PCA+Fed-kMeans、Fed-LSH）与其集中式对应方法进行基准测试，使用标准数学指标和新提出的化学评估指标SF-ICF。

Result: 大规模基准测试和深入可解释性分析表明，结合领域知识的化学评估指标和客户端可解释性分析对分子数据的联邦多样性分析至关重要。

Conclusion: 联邦聚类方法能够有效处理分布式分子数据，但需要结合领域知识和化学评估指标来获得更好的结果。

Abstract: AI methods are increasingly shaping pharmaceutical drug discovery. However,
their translation to industrial applications remains limited due to their
reliance on public datasets, lacking scale and diversity of proprietary
pharmaceutical data. Federated learning (FL) offers a promising approach to
integrate private data into privacy-preserving, collaborative model training
across data silos. This federated data access complicates important
data-centric tasks such as estimating dataset diversity, performing informed
data splits, and understanding the structure of the combined chemical space. To
address this gap, we investigate how well federated clustering methods can
disentangle and represent distributed molecular data. We benchmark three
approaches, Federated kMeans (Fed-kMeans), Federated Principal Component
Analysis combined with Fed-kMeans (Fed-PCA+Fed-kMeans), and Federated
Locality-Sensitive Hashing (Fed-LSH), against their centralized counterparts on
eight diverse molecular datasets. Our evaluation utilizes both, standard
mathematical and a chemistry-informed evaluation metrics, SF-ICF, that we
introduce in this work. The large-scale benchmarking combined with an in-depth
explainability analysis shows the importance of incorporating domain knowledge
through chemistry-informed metrics, and on-client explainability analyses for
federated diversity analysis on molecular data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器学习在COVID-19预测中显示出价值，但在地方性传染病预测方面仍待探索。需要开发能够长期预测RSV等地方性疾病的模型。

Method: 基于XGBoost+CNN+BiLSTM的集成模型，结合高分辨率特征学习和长程时间依赖捕捉机制，通过自回归模块训练气候控制的滞后关系，使用随机推理返回概率区间。

Result: 在美国34个州的评估中，ForecastNet-XCL在州内和跨州场景中均可靠地优于统计基线、单个神经网络和传统集成方法，在长期预测中保持准确性。

Conclusion: ForecastNet-XCL的效率、性能和不确定性感知设计使其成为在气候压力加剧和监测资源受限情况下的可部署早期预警工具。

Abstract: Precise outbreak forecasting of infectious diseases is essential for
effective public health responses and epidemic control. The increased
availability of machine learning (ML) methods for time-series forecasting
presents an enticing avenue to enhance outbreak forecasting. Though the
COVID-19 outbreak demonstrated the value of applying ML models to predict
epidemic profiles, using ML models to forecast endemic diseases remains
underexplored. In this work, we present ForecastNet-XCL (an ensemble model
based on XGBoost+CNN+BiLSTM), a deep learning hybrid framework designed to
addresses this gap by creating accurate multi-week RSV forecasts up to 100
weeks in advance based on climate and temporal data, without access to
real-time surveillance on RSV. The framework combines high-resolution feature
learning with long-range temporal dependency capturing mechanisms, bolstered by
an autoregressive module trained on climate-controlled lagged relations.
Stochastic inference returns probabilistic intervals to inform decision-making.
Evaluated across 34 U.S. states, ForecastNet-XCL reliably outperformed
statistical baselines, individual neural nets, and conventional ensemble
methods in both within- and cross-state scenarios, sustaining accuracy over
extended forecast horizons. Training on climatologically diverse datasets
enhanced generalization furthermore, particularly in locations having irregular
or biennial RSV patterns. ForecastNet-XCL's efficiency, performance, and
uncertainty-aware design make it a deployable early-warning tool amid
escalating climate pressures and constrained surveillance resources.

TL;DR: DiffEvac是一种基于生成模型的新方法，通过学习建筑疏散模式实现高效疏散模拟和安全设计，相比传统方法显著提升速度和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统疏散模拟依赖精细化建模和大量参数，难以在早期设计阶段快速迭代应用，需要更高效的方法来支持快速设计迭代。

Method: 建立399个不同功能布局和对应疏散热力图的数据集，提出解耦特征表示方法嵌入物理特征，基于图像提示的扩散模型学习疏散模式。

Result: 相比现有条件GAN方法，DiffEvac在SSIM上提升37.6%，PSNR提升142%，速度提升16倍，模拟时间缩短至2分钟。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升快速设计迭代效率，为智能建筑安全优化提供新思路，降低建模负担，支持大规模假设探索，便于与多目标设计工具集成。

Abstract: Evacuation simulation is essential for building safety design, ensuring
properly planned evacuation routes. However, traditional evacuation simulation
relies heavily on refined modeling with extensive parameters, making it
challenging to adopt such methods in a rapid iteration process in early design
stages. Thus, this study proposes DiffEvac, a novel method to learn building
evacuation patterns based on Generative Models (GMs), for efficient evacuation
simulation and enhanced safety design. Initially, a dataset of 399 diverse
functional layouts and corresponding evacuation heatmaps of buildings was
established. Then, a decoupled feature representation is proposed to embed
physical features like layouts and occupant density for GMs. Finally, a
diffusion model based on image prompts is proposed to learn evacuation patterns
from simulated evacuation heatmaps. Compared to existing research using
Conditional GANs with RGB representation, DiffEvac achieves up to a 37.6%
improvement in SSIM, 142% in PSNR, and delivers results 16 times faster,
thereby cutting simulation time to 2 minutes. Case studies further demonstrate
that the proposed method not only significantly enhances the rapid design
iteration and adjustment process with efficient evacuation simulation but also
offers new insights and technical pathways for future safety optimization in
intelligent building design. The research implication is that the approach
lowers the modeling burden, enables large-scale what-if exploration, and
facilitates coupling with multi-objective design tools.

Abstract: This paper argues that the method of least squares has significant
unfulfilled potential in modern machine learning, far beyond merely being a
tool for fitting linear models. To release its potential, we derive custom
gradients that transform the solver into a differentiable operator, like a
neural network layer, enabling many diverse applications. Empirically, we
demonstrate: (i) scalability by enforcing weight sparsity on a 50 million
parameter model; (ii) imposing conservativeness constraints in score-based
generative models; and (iii) hyperparameter tuning of Gaussian processes based
on predictive performance. By doing this, our work represents the next
iteration in developing differentiable linear-algebra tools and making them
widely accessible to machine learning practitioners.

Motivation: 现有的LoRA变体缺乏明确区分任务相关信息与残差信息的机制，限制了在下游任务中的性能表现。

Method: 使用变分自编码器学习两个不同的潜在空间，通过新颖的证据下界公式化促进潜在空间的因子分解，一个空间专门用于任务显著特征，另一个用于残差信息。

Result: 在文本、音频和图像任务上的广泛实验表明，FVAE-LoRA始终优于标准LoRA。虚假相关性评估证实FVAE-LoRA能更好地隔离任务相关信号，在分布偏移下具有更强的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: FVAE-LoRA通过显式分离任务相关特征和残差信息，有效提升了LoRA在下游任务中的性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) is a widely used method for parameter-efficient
finetuning. However, existing LoRA variants lack mechanisms to explicitly
disambiguate task-relevant information within the learned low-rank subspace,
potentially limiting downstream performance. We propose Factorized Variational
Autoencoder LoRA (FVAE-LoRA), which leverages a VAE to learn two distinct
latent spaces. Our novel Evidence Lower Bound formulation explicitly promotes
factorization between the latent spaces, dedicating one latent space to
task-salient features and the other to residual information. Extensive
experiments on text, audio, and image tasks demonstrate that FVAE-LoRA
consistently outperforms standard LoRA. Moreover, spurious correlation
evaluations confirm that FVAE-LoRA better isolates task-relevant signals,
leading to improved robustness under distribution shifts. Our code is publicly
available at: https://github.com/idiap/FVAE-LoRA

TL;DR: 提出一种新的重叠加权正交元学习器，用于在时间变化设置中估计异质性处理效应，解决处理序列重叠不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在时间变化设置中估计异质性处理效应面临严重挑战，因为观察某些治疗序列的概率随预测时间延长呈指数下降，导致数据支持不足和重叠问题。现有方法假设充分的重叠，在重叠低时估计方差会爆炸性增长。

Method: 开发了一种新颖的重叠加权正交元学习器，通过Neyman正交总体风险函数来最小化重叠加权的oracle风险。该方法具有Neyman正交性，对干扰函数误设具有鲁棒性，且完全模型无关。

Result: 通过使用transformer和LSTM骨干网络的广泛实验，证明了新WO学习器的优势，能够抵消现有元学习器的不稳定性，获得更可靠的异质性处理效应估计。

Conclusion: 提出的重叠加权正交元学习器能够有效解决时间变化设置中的处理序列重叠问题，提供更稳定和可靠的异质性处理效应估计，且具有模型无关性和对干扰函数误设的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Estimating heterogeneous treatment effects (HTEs) in time-varying settings is
particularly challenging, as the probability of observing certain treatment
sequences decreases exponentially with longer prediction horizons. Thus, the
observed data contain little support for many plausible treatment sequences,
which creates severe overlap problems. Existing meta-learners for the
time-varying setting typically assume adequate treatment overlap, and thus
suffer from exploding estimation variance when the overlap is low. To address
this problem, we introduce a novel overlap-weighted orthogonal (WO)
meta-learner for estimating HTEs that targets regions in the observed data with
high probability of receiving the interventional treatment sequences. This
offers a fully data-driven approach through which our WO-learner can counteract
instabilities as in existing meta-learners and thus obtain more reliable HTE
estimates. Methodologically, we develop a novel Neyman-orthogonal population
risk function that minimizes the overlap-weighted oracle risk. We show that our
WO-learner has the favorable property of Neyman-orthogonality, meaning that it
is robust against misspecification in the nuisance functions. Further, our
WO-learner is fully model-agnostic and can be applied to any machine learning
model. Through extensive experiments with both transformer and LSTM backbones,
we demonstrate the benefits of our novel WO-learner.

TL;DR: 本文研究带弃权机制的政策学习，允许策略在不确定时选择弃权，获得比随机猜测稍高的奖励。提出了两阶段学习器，建立快速后悔保证，并将弃权应用于政策学习的其他核心问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统政策学习算法在预测不确定时仍强制决策，这在高风险场景中很危险。需要允许策略在不确定时弃权，转向安全默认选项或专家决策。

Method: 提出两阶段学习器：首先识别一组近似最优策略，然后基于这些策略之间的分歧构建弃权规则。在已知倾向得分时建立O(1/n)后悔保证，并通过双重稳健目标扩展到未知倾向得分情况。

Result: 弃权机制是通用工具，可应用于政策学习的多个核心问题：在边际条件下无需可实现性假设即可获得改进保证；通过应对小数据偏移与分布鲁棒政策学习连接；支持安全政策改进，确保以高概率优于基线策略。

Conclusion: 弃权机制为高风险环境中的政策学习提供了安全保障，同时保持理论上的最优性，并能扩展到政策学习的其他重要问题。

Abstract: Policy learning algorithms are widely used in areas such as personalized
medicine and advertising to develop individualized treatment regimes. However,
most methods force a decision even when predictions are uncertain, which is
risky in high-stakes settings. We study policy learning with abstention, where
a policy may defer to a safe default or an expert. When a policy abstains, it
receives a small additive reward on top of the value of a random guess. We
propose a two-stage learner that first identifies a set of near-optimal
policies and then constructs an abstention rule from their disagreements. We
establish fast O(1/n)-type regret guarantees when propensities are known, and
extend these guarantees to the unknown-propensity case via a doubly robust (DR)
objective. We further show that abstention is a versatile tool with direct
applications to other core problems in policy learning: it yields improved
guarantees under margin conditions without the common realizability assumption,
connects to distributionally robust policy learning by hedging against small
data shifts, and supports safe policy improvement by ensuring improvement over
a baseline policy with high probability.

Abstract: Memory-efficient training of deep neural networks has become increasingly
important as models grow larger while deployment environments impose strict

architecture-dependent and determinable a priori, while dynamic stochastic
channel selection provides superior gradient approximation compared to static
approaches. We introduce a dynamic channel selection approach that
stochastically resamples channels between epochs within preselected layers.
Extensive experiments demonstrate TraDy achieves state-of-the-art performance
across various downstream tasks and architectures while maintaining strict
memory constraints, achieving up to 99% activation sparsity, 95% weight
derivative sparsity, and 97% reduction in FLOPs for weight derivative
computation.

Motivation: 传统推测解码使用单一草稿模型，但实际存在多种潜在草稿模型选择，从快速但不准确到慢速但可靠。现有方法未能充分利用这些模型的层次化潜力。

Method: 将草稿模型堆叠成层次结构，每个模型生成token，下一个更大的模型在单次前向传递中验证，最终由目标模型验证所有token。推导了层次结构的期望延迟表达式，并证明可以在多项式时间内选择延迟最优的层次结构。

Result: HSD相比最佳单草稿基线可获得高达1.2倍的加速效果，证明了该算法在减少生成延迟方面超越先前技术的实用性。

Conclusion: 分层推测解码通过层次化利用多个草稿模型，有效降低了Transformer语言模型的推理延迟，且能在多项式时间内找到最优层次结构配置。

Abstract: Transformer language models generate text autoregressively, making inference
latency proportional to the number of tokens generated. Speculative decoding
reduces this latency without sacrificing output quality, by leveraging a small
draft model to propose tokens that the larger target model verifies in
parallel. In practice, however, there may exist a set of potential draft
models- ranging from faster but less inaccurate, to slower yet more reliable.
We introduce Hierarchical Speculative Decoding (HSD), an algorithm that stacks
these draft models into a hierarchy, where each model proposes tokens, and the
next larger model verifies them in a single forward pass, until finally the
target model verifies tokens. We derive an expression for the expected latency
of any such hierarchy and show that selecting the latency-optimal hierarchy can
be done in polynomial time. Empirically, HSD gives up to 1.2x speed-up over the
best single-draft baseline, demonstrating the practicality of our algorithm in
reducing generation latency beyond previous techniques.

<details>

Motivation: 现有时间序列基础模型需要大规模预训练和庞大网络架构，难以在资源受限环境中部署，需要在多功能性和可负担性之间找到平衡。

Method: 1) 能量感知频谱分解模块，同时建模高能量和低能量频率信号；2) 混合提示Transformer，通过数据集特定提示学习异质时序模式，实现参数高效适配。

Result: 在两个大规模基准测试的16个数据集上，SEMPO在零样本和少样本预测场景中均优于现有最优方法。

Conclusion: SEMPO显著减少了预训练数据规模和模型大小，同时实现了强大的泛化性能，为资源受限环境中的时间序列预测提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The recent boom of large pre-trained models witnesses remarkable success in
developing foundation models (FMs) for time series forecasting. Despite
impressive performance across diverse downstream forecasting tasks, existing
time series FMs possess massive network architectures and require substantial
pre-training on large-scale datasets, which significantly hinders their
deployment in resource-constrained environments. In response to this growing
tension between versatility and affordability, we propose SEMPO, a novel
lightweight foundation model that requires pretraining on relatively
small-scale data, yet exhibits strong general time series forecasting.
Concretely, SEMPO comprises two key modules: 1) energy-aware SpEctral
decomposition module, that substantially improves the utilization of
pre-training data by modeling not only the high-energy frequency signals but
also the low-energy yet informative frequency signals that are ignored in
current methods; and 2) Mixture-of-PrOmpts enabled Transformer, that learns
heterogeneous temporal patterns through small dataset-specific prompts and
adaptively routes time series tokens to prompt-based experts for
parameter-efficient model adaptation across different datasets and domains.
Equipped with these modules, SEMPO significantly reduces both pre-training data
scale and model size, while achieving strong generalization. Extensive
experiments on two large-scale benchmarks covering 16 datasets demonstrate the
superior performance of SEMPO in both zero-shot and few-shot forecasting
scenarios compared with state-of-the-art methods. Code and data are available
at https://github.com/mala-lab/SEMPO.

Motivation: 解决医疗AI中敏感电子健康记录数据隐私保护问题，同时确保模型在人口层面和细粒度亚组中的可信评估。

Method: 基于先前的扩散和VAE生成器，引入Enhanced TimeAutoDiff，在潜在扩散目标中加入分布对齐惩罚项。

Result: Enhanced TimeAutoDiff将真实-合成评估差距减少了70%以上，在32个交叉亚组中，大型合成队列将亚组级AUROC估计误差降低了50%，在72-84%的亚组中优于小型真实测试集。

Conclusion: 该工作为重症监护中可信、细粒度的模型评估提供了实用的隐私保护路线图，能够在保护敏感EHR数据的同时实现跨多样化患者群体的稳健可靠性能分析。

Abstract: We present a novel framework for leveraging synthetic ICU time-series data
not only to train but also to rigorously and trustworthily evaluate predictive
models, both at the population level and within fine-grained demographic
subgroups. Building on prior diffusion and VAE-based generators (TimeDiff,
HealthGen, TimeAutoDiff), we introduce \textit{Enhanced TimeAutoDiff}, which
augments the latent diffusion objective with distribution-alignment penalties.
We extensively benchmark all models on MIMIC-III and eICU, on 24-hour mortality
and binary length-of-stay tasks. Our results show that Enhanced TimeAutoDiff
reduces the gap between real-on-synthetic and real-on-real evaluation (``TRTS
gap'') by over 70\%, achieving $\Delta_{TRTS} \leq 0.014$ AUROC, while
preserving training utility ($\Delta_{TSTR} \approx 0.01$). Crucially, for 32
intersectional subgroups, large synthetic cohorts cut subgroup-level AUROC
estimation error by up to 50\% relative to small real test sets, and outperform
them in 72--84\% of subgroups. This work provides a practical,
privacy-preserving roadmap for trustworthy, granular model evaluation in
critical care, enabling robust and reliable performance analysis across diverse
patient populations without exposing sensitive EHR data, contributing to the
overall trustworthiness of Medical AI.

TL;DR: 该论文建立了在线最小二乘SGD的线性泛函的非渐近Berry-Esseen界，在增长维度机制下提供高斯中心极限定理，显著扩展了先前工作的维度范围并提高了计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在高风险应用中部署SGD需要严格量化其固有不确定性，现有方法计算昂贵且维度缩放受限。

Method: 提出基于在线SGD的程序，开发在线方差估计器，并建立该估计器的高概率偏差界。

Result: SGD迭代在迭代次数增长为t ≳ d^(1+δ)时满足CLT，运行时间为O(td)，内存需求为O(d)，优于协方差逆方法的O(td² + d³)。

Conclusion: 这些结果产生了第一个完全在线和数据驱动的框架，用于在接近最优缩放机制t ≳ d^(1+δ)下构建SGD迭代的置信区间。

Abstract: Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) has become a cornerstone method in modern
data science. However, deploying SGD in high-stakes applications necessitates
rigorous quantification of its inherent uncertainty. In this work, we establish
\emph{non-asymptotic Berry--Esseen bounds} for linear functionals of online
least-squares SGD, thereby providing a Gaussian Central Limit Theorem (CLT) in
a \emph{growing-dimensional regime}. Existing approaches to high-dimensional
inference for projection parameters, such as~\cite{chang2023inference}, rely on
inverting empirical covariance matrices and require at least $t \gtrsim
d^{3/2}$ iterations to achieve finite-sample Berry--Esseen guarantees,
rendering them computationally expensive and restrictive in the allowable
dimensional scaling. In contrast, we show that a CLT holds for SGD iterates
when the number of iterations grows as $t \gtrsim d^{1+\delta}$ for any $\delta
> 0$, significantly extending the dimensional regime permitted by prior works
while improving computational efficiency. The proposed online SGD-based
procedure operates in $\mathcal{O}(td)$ time and requires only $\mathcal{O}(d)$
memory, in contrast to the $\mathcal{O}(td^2 + d^3)$ runtime of
covariance-inversion methods. To render the theory practically applicable, we
further develop an \emph{online variance estimator} for the asymptotic variance
appearing in the CLT and establish \emph{high-probability deviation bounds} for
this estimator. Collectively, these results yield the first fully online and
data-driven framework for constructing confidence intervals for SGD iterates in
the near-optimal scaling regime $t \gtrsim d^{1+\delta}$.

TL;DR: 扩散模型存在计算开销大和生成延迟高的问题，Diffusion Caching提出了一种无需训练、架构无关的高效推理范式，通过识别和重用扩散过程中的计算冗余来减少计算量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型的多步迭代和复杂网络结构导致计算开销和生成延迟过高，限制了实时应用。现有加速技术存在适用性有限、训练成本高或质量下降等问题。

Method: Diffusion Caching通过特征级跨步重用和层间调度机制，在不修改模型参数的情况下减少计算。该方法从静态重用到动态预测演进，提高了缓存灵活性。

Result: Diffusion Caching能够有效减少扩散模型的计算开销，支持与其他加速技术（如采样优化和模型蒸馏）的集成，为多模态和交互应用提供统一的推理框架。

Conclusion: Diffusion Caching将成为实时高效生成AI的关键推动者，为高效生成智能的理论和实践注入新活力。

Abstract: Diffusion Models have become a cornerstone of modern generative AI for their
exceptional generation quality and controllability. However, their inherent
\textit{multi-step iterations} and \textit{complex backbone networks} lead to
prohibitive computational overhead and generation latency, forming a major
bottleneck for real-time applications. Although existing acceleration
techniques have made progress, they still face challenges such as limited
applicability, high training costs, or quality degradation.
  Against this backdrop, \textbf{Diffusion Caching} offers a promising
training-free, architecture-agnostic, and efficient inference paradigm. Its
core mechanism identifies and reuses intrinsic computational redundancies in
the diffusion process. By enabling feature-level cross-step reuse and
inter-layer scheduling, it reduces computation without modifying model
parameters. This paper systematically reviews the theoretical foundations and
evolution of Diffusion Caching and proposes a unified framework for its
classification and analysis.
  Through comparative analysis of representative methods, we show that
Diffusion Caching evolves from \textit{static reuse} to \textit{dynamic
prediction}. This trend enhances caching flexibility across diverse tasks and
enables integration with other acceleration techniques such as sampling
optimization and model distillation, paving the way for a unified, efficient
inference framework for future multimodal and interactive applications. We
argue that this paradigm will become a key enabler of real-time and efficient
generative AI, injecting new vitality into both theory and practice of
\textit{Efficient Generative Intelligence}.

Motivation: 现有深度学习物种分布模型在复杂异构数据集上表现良好，但受到数据空间偏差的限制，需要更有效地结合局部观测与生态模式。

Method: 从贝叶斯视角重新审视深度物种分布模型，提出BATIS框架，通过迭代更新先验预测来整合有限观测数据，并采用多种不确定性量化方法。

Conclusion: 贝叶斯深度学习可以大大提高物种分布模型在数据稀缺地区的可靠性，有助于生态理解和保护工作。

Abstract: Species distribution models (SDMs), which aim to predict species occurrence
based on environmental variables, are widely used to monitor and respond to
biodiversity change. Recent deep learning advances for SDMs have been shown to
perform well on complex and heterogeneous datasets, but their effectiveness
remains limited by spatial biases in the data. In this paper, we revisit deep
SDMs from a Bayesian perspective and introduce BATIS, a novel and practical
framework wherein prior predictions are updated iteratively using limited
observational data. Models must appropriately capture both aleatoric and
epistemic uncertainty to effectively combine fine-grained local insights with
broader ecological patterns. We benchmark an extensive set of uncertainty
quantification approaches on a novel dataset including citizen science
observations from the eBird platform. Our empirical study shows how Bayesian
deep learning approaches can greatly improve the reliability of SDMs in
data-scarce locations, which can contribute to ecological understanding and
conservation efforts.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文解释了Transformer在算法学习中的局限性，通过图连通性问题展示了模型容量对学习策略的影响。研究发现模型会基于训练数据的难度选择学习精确算法或简单启发式方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer模型经常学习脆弱的启发式方法而非通用算法，本文旨在从理论和实证角度解释这一现象，特别是在图连通性问题上的表现。

Method: 使用简化的解耦Transformer架构，分析模型层数与能解决的图直径之间的关系，研究训练动态和不同难度训练数据对学习策略的影响。

Result: 证明L层模型能解决直径不超过3^L的图，实现类似于邻接矩阵幂运算的算法。当训练数据在模型容量内时学习正确算法，超出容量时学习基于节点度的启发式方法。

Conclusion: 通过限制训练数据在模型容量范围内，可以使标准和解耦Transformer学习精确算法而非启发式方法，这为解决Transformer算法泛化问题提供了重要洞见。

Abstract: Transformers often fail to learn generalizable algorithms, instead relying on
brittle heuristics. Using graph connectivity as a testbed, we explain this
phenomenon both theoretically and empirically. We consider a simplified
Transformer architecture, the disentangled Transformer, and prove that an
$L$-layer model has capacity to solve for graphs with diameters up to exactly
$3^L$, implementing an algorithm equivalent to computing powers of the
adjacency matrix. We analyze the training-dynamics, and show that the learned
strategy hinges on whether most training instances are within this model
capacity. Within-capacity graphs (diameter $\leq 3^L$) drive the learning of a
correct algorithmic solution while beyond-capacity graphs drive the learning of
a simple heuristic based on node degrees. Finally, we empirically demonstrate
that restricting training data within a model's capacity leads to both standard
and disentangled transformers learning the exact algorithm rather than the
degree-based heuristic.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有反事实解释方法往往忽视预测不确定性，缺乏将不确定性纳入解释的机制和正式保证，可能导致误导性解释。

Method: 结合共形预测和混合整数线性规划，通过离线树基分区开发局部化CP程序，实现高效MILP编码。

Result: 在多个基准测试和指标上优于现有方法，产生更鲁棒和合理的解释。

Conclusion: CONFEX能够生成具有严格预测不确定性和最优性保证的反事实解释，解决了CFX生成违反可交换性的问题。

Abstract: Counterfactual explanations (CFXs) provide human-understandable
justifications for model predictions, enabling actionable recourse and
enhancing interpretability. To be reliable, CFXs must avoid regions of high
predictive uncertainty, where explanations may be misleading or inapplicable.
However, existing methods often neglect uncertainty or lack principled
mechanisms for incorporating it with formal guarantees. We propose CONFEX, a
novel method for generating uncertainty-aware counterfactual explanations using
Conformal Prediction (CP) and Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP). CONFEX
explanations are designed to provide local coverage guarantees, addressing the
issue that CFX generation violates exchangeability. To do so, we develop a
novel localised CP procedure that enjoys an efficient MILP encoding by
leveraging an offline tree-based partitioning of the input space. This way,
CONFEX generates CFXs with rigorous guarantees on both predictive uncertainty
and optimality. We evaluate CONFEX against state-of-the-art methods across
diverse benchmarks and metrics, demonstrating that our uncertainty-aware
approach yields robust and plausible explanations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有最先进的成员推理攻击需要训练大量计算昂贵的参考模型，限制了实用性，需要开发更高效的风险评估方法。

Method: 利用训练和测试分布中高损失区域异常值的缺失作为风险预测指标，通过简单的损失攻击真负率来估计模型级脆弱性。

Result: 该方法在各种架构和数据集上都能准确估计模型对最先进MIA攻击的脆弱性，优于低成本和基于分布差异的方法。

Conclusion: 该方法为评估模型隐私风险提供了一种高效实用的替代方案，在大型语言模型风险评估方面也显示出潜力。

Abstract: Membership inference attacks (MIAs) have emerged as the standard tool for
evaluating the privacy risks of AI models. However, state-of-the-art attacks
require training numerous, often computationally expensive, reference models,
limiting their practicality. We present a novel approach for estimating
model-level vulnerability, the TPR at low FPR, to membership inference attacks
without requiring reference models. Empirical analysis shows loss distributions
to be asymmetric and heavy-tailed and suggests that most points at risk from
MIAs have moved from the tail (high-loss region) to the head (low-loss region)
of the distribution after training. We leverage this insight to propose a
method to estimate model-level vulnerability from the training and testing
distribution alone: using the absence of outliers from the high-loss region as
a predictor of the risk. We evaluate our method, the TNR of a simple loss
attack, across a wide range of architectures and datasets and show it to
accurately estimate model-level vulnerability to the SOTA MIA attack (LiRA). We
also show our method to outperform both low-cost (few reference models) attacks
such as RMIA and other measures of distribution difference. We finally evaluate
the use of non-linear functions to evaluate risk and show the approach to be
promising to evaluate the risk in large-language models.

TL;DR: GaLLoP是一种基于梯度的稀疏学习技术，通过选择梯度幅度最大且预训练幅度最小的参数进行微调，在保持预训练知识的同时有效适应下游任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 稀疏微调技术通过只调整模型参数的稀疏子集来适应下游任务，但其效果取决于如何最优选择要微调的参数。现有方法在参数选择上存在优化空间。

Method: GaLLoP选择具有最大梯度幅度（任务相关性高）和最小预训练幅度（对预训练知识破坏最小）的参数进行微调，优先考虑高度任务相关但最小化预训练知识干扰的参数。

Result: 在LLaMA3 8B和Gemma 2B上的实验表明，GaLLoP在分布内和分布外性能上持续改进或匹配其他领先的参数高效微调技术（如LoRA、DoRA、SAFT），同时减轻灾难性遗忘和任务数据记忆问题。

Conclusion: GaLLoP通过选择性微调关键参数，在保持性能稳定性的同时实现鲁棒泛化，比现有方法更有效地平衡任务适应和预训练知识保留。

Abstract: Sparse fine-tuning techniques adapt LLMs to downstream tasks by only tuning a
sparse subset of model parameters. However, the effectiveness of sparse
adaptation depends on optimally selecting the model parameters to be
fine-tuned. In this work, we introduce a novel sparse fine-tuning technique
named GaLLoP: Gradient-based Sparse Learning on Low-Magnitude Parameters, which
fine-tunes only those model parameters which have the largest gradient
magnitudes on downstream tasks and the smallest pre-trained magnitudes,
intuitively prioritizing parameters that are highly task-relevant, but
minimally disruptive to pre-trained knowledge. Our experimentation with LLaMA3
8B and Gemma 2B as base models shows that GaLLoP consistently improves or
matches the in-distribution as well as out-of-distribution performance obtained
via the usage of other leading parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques,
including LoRA, DoRA, and SAFT. Our analysis demonstrates that GaLLoP mitigates
catastrophic forgetting and memorization of task data, as important pre-trained
parameters remain unchanged, and stabilizes performance relative to other
fine-tuning techniques, robustly generalizing across most random seeds.

Motivation: 现有数据驱动方法依赖IID数据假设，处理环境差异的泛化技术需要环境标签，但这些标签在训练时往往因数据采集挑战、隐私问题和环境变异性而不可得。

Method: 提出DynaInfer方法，通过分析固定神经网络在每轮训练中的预测误差来推断环境规范，直接从数据中实现环境分配。

Result: 实验表明DynaInfer优于现有环境分配技术，能快速收敛到真实标签，甚至在环境标签可用时也能实现更优性能。

Conclusion: DynaInfer有效解决了无环境标签情况下的环境推断问题，为复杂动态系统分析提供了更实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Data-driven methods offer efficient and robust solutions for analyzing
complex dynamical systems but rely on the assumption of I.I.D. data, driving
the development of generalization techniques for handling environmental
differences. These techniques, however, are limited by their dependence on
environment labels, which are often unavailable during training due to data
acquisition challenges, privacy concerns, and environmental variability,
particularly in large public datasets and privacy-sensitive domains. In
response, we propose DynaInfer, a novel method that infers environment
specifications by analyzing prediction errors from fixed neural networks within
each training round, enabling environment assignments directly from data. We
prove our algorithm effectively solves the alternating optimization problem in
unlabeled scenarios and validate it through extensive experiments across
diverse dynamical systems. Results show that DynaInfer outperforms existing
environment assignment techniques, converges rapidly to true labels, and even
achieves superior performance when environment labels are available.

Conclusion: 该方法能够可靠地检测模型衍生使用，为模型版权保护提供了统计证据支持。

Abstract: Suppose Alice trains an open-weight language model and Bob uses a blackbox
derivative of Alice's model to produce text. Can Alice prove that Bob is using
her model, either by querying Bob's derivative model (query setting) or from
the text alone (observational setting)? We formulate this question as an
independence testing problem--in which the null hypothesis is that Bob's model
or text is independent of Alice's randomized training run--and investigate it
through the lens of palimpsestic memorization in language models: models are
more likely to memorize data seen later in training, so we can test whether Bob
is using Alice's model using test statistics that capture correlation between
Bob's model or text and the ordering of training examples in Alice's training
run. If Alice has randomly shuffled her training data, then any significant
correlation amounts to exactly quantifiable statistical evidence against the
null hypothesis, regardless of the composition of Alice's training data. In the
query setting, we directly estimate (via prompting) the likelihood Bob's model
gives to Alice's training examples and order; we correlate the likelihoods of
over 40 fine-tunes of various Pythia and OLMo base models ranging from 1B to
12B parameters with the base model's training data order, achieving a p-value
on the order of at most 1e-8 in all but six cases. In the observational
setting, we try two approaches based on estimating 1) the likelihood of Bob's
text overlapping with spans of Alice's training examples and 2) the likelihood
of Bob's text with respect to different versions of Alice's model we obtain by
repeating the last phase (e.g., 1%) of her training run on reshuffled data. The
second approach can reliably distinguish Bob's text from as little as a few
hundred tokens; the first does not involve any retraining but requires many
more tokens (several hundred thousand) to achieve high power.

*Roey Magen,Gal Vardi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文首次从理论上证明，通过梯度下降训练的简化Transformer架构可以在线性分类设置中作为接近最优的元学习器，仅需少量上下文示例就能适应新任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然Transformer展示了强大的上下文学习能力，但现有理论研究大多未在正式元学习框架下分析其能否作为元学习器，即能否比单独解决每个任务更高效地解决相关任务集合。

Method: 使用简化Transformer架构，在类条件高斯混合模型的任务族上进行训练，其中均值向量位于共享的k维子空间中。通过梯度下降训练后，使用少量上下文示例测试其泛化能力。

Result: 训练后的Transformer仅需O(k/R^4)个上下文示例就能泛化到新任务，这几乎匹配了知道共享子空间的最优学习器性能，且显著优于仅依赖上下文数据的学习器（后者需要Ω(d/R^4)个示例）。

Conclusion: Transformer可以作为有效的元学习器，其训练任务数和每任务示例数与环境维度d无关，在理论上证明了Transformer在元学习设置中的优越性能。

Abstract: Transformers have demonstrated impressive in-context learning (ICL)
capabilities, raising the question of whether they can serve as metalearners
that adapt to new tasks using only a small number of in-context examples,
without any further training. While recent theoretical work has studied
transformers' ability to perform ICL, most of these analyses do not address the
formal metalearning setting, where the objective is to solve a collection of
related tasks more efficiently than would be possible by solving each task
individually. In this paper, we provide the first theoretical analysis showing
that a simplified transformer architecture trained via gradient descent can act
as a near-optimal metalearner in a linear classification setting. We consider a
natural family of tasks where each task corresponds to a class-conditional
Gaussian mixture model, with the mean vectors lying in a shared $k$-dimensional
subspace of $R^d$. After training on a sufficient number of such tasks, we show
that the transformer can generalize to a new task using only $O(k / R^4)$
in-context examples, where $R$ denotes the signal strength at test time. This
performance (almost) matches that of an optimal learner that knows exactly the
shared subspace and significantly outperforms any learner that only has access
to the in-context data, which requires $\Omega(d / R^4)$ examples to
generalize. Importantly, our bounds on the number of training tasks and
examples per task needed to achieve this result are independent of the ambient
dimension $d$.

Motivation: 大型语言模型训练的计算需求加剧了全球南北之间的结构性不对称，研究旨在探讨全球南方国家在硬件、能源和财政约束下实现技术主权的可行性。

Method: 采用双轴设计，比较不同加速器（H100 vs A100）和训练时长（90天 vs 150天），评估计算需求、能耗、资本支出和监管兼容性。

Result: 所有配置均低于出口管制和电力基础设施阈值，但财政可行性取决于硬件效率。H100方案成本8-14百万美元可行，A100方案需19-32百万美元。

Conclusion: 延长训练时间可作为缓解硬件约束的政策工具，使中等收入国家能够建立可持续且战略充足的AI能力，实现技术主权。

Abstract: The rapid escalation of computational requirements for training large-scale
language models has reinforced structural asymmetries between high-capacity
jurisdictions and countries in the Global South. This paper examines the
technical and fiscal feasibility of sovereign-scale language model training in
Brazil and Mexico under conditions of constrained hardware access, energy
availability, and fiscal ceilings. Using a dual-axis design that varies
accelerator generation (NVIDIA H100 vs. A100) and training duration (90 vs. 150
days), we estimate compute demand, energy consumption, capital expenditures,
and regulatory compatibility for the training of a 10-trillion-token model. Our
findings show that while all configurations remain below export-control and
electrical infrastructure thresholds, fiscal viability is determined by
hardware efficiency. H100-based scenarios achieve training feasibility at a
total cost of 8-14 million USD, while A100 deployments require 19-32 million
USD due to higher energy and hardware demand. We argue that extending training
timelines should be treated as a policy lever to mitigate hardware constraints,
enabling the production of usable, auditable, and locally aligned models
without competing at the global frontier. This study contributes to the
discourse on AI compute governance and technological sovereignty by
highlighting context-sensitive strategies that allow middle-income countries to
establish sustainable and strategically sufficient AI capabilities.

Abstract: Planning with world models offers a powerful paradigm for robotic control.
Conventional approaches train a model to predict future frames conditioned on
current frames and actions, which can then be used for planning. However, the
objective of predicting future pixels is often at odds with the actual planning
objective; strong pixel reconstruction does not always correlate with good
planning decisions. This paper posits that instead of reconstructing future
frames as pixels, world models only need to predict task-relevant semantic
information about the future. For such prediction the paper poses world
modeling as a visual question answering problem about semantic information in
future frames. This perspective allows world modeling to be approached with the
same tools underlying vision language models. Thus vision language models can
be trained as "semantic" world models through a supervised finetuning process
on image-action-text data, enabling planning for decision-making while
inheriting many of the generalization and robustness properties from the
pretrained vision-language models. The paper demonstrates how such a semantic
world model can be used for policy improvement on open-ended robotics tasks,
leading to significant generalization improvements over typical paradigms of
reconstruction-based action-conditional world modeling. Website available at
