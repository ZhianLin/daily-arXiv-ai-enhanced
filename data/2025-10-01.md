### [1] [LUMA: Low-Dimension Unified Motion Alignment with Dual-Path Anchoring for Text-to-Motion Diffusion Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25304)
*Haozhe Jia,Wenshuo Chen,Yuqi Lin,Yang Yang,Lei Wang,Mang Ning,Bowen Tian,Songning Lai,Nanqian Jia,Yifan Chen,Yutao Yue*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LUMA是一个基于扩散模型的文本到动作生成方法，通过双路径锚定机制解决语义对齐和运动伪影问题，在HumanML3D和KIT-ML数据集上达到SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于U-Net架构的扩散模型在文本到动作生成任务中存在语义错位和运动伪影问题，深层网络梯度衰减导致高层特征学习不足。

Method: 提出LUMA模型，包含两条路径：1) 轻量级MoCLIP模型提供时间域语义监督；2) 从低频DCT分量提取频率域对齐信号。通过时间调制机制自适应融合两种锚定信号。

Result: 在HumanML3D和KIT-ML数据集上分别达到0.035和0.123的FID分数，收敛速度比基线快1.4倍。

Conclusion: LUMA通过双路径锚定机制有效解决了文本到动作生成中的语义对齐问题，是一个高效且可扩展的高保真解决方案。

Abstract: While current diffusion-based models, typically built on U-Net architectures,
have shown promising results on the text-to-motion generation task, they still
suffer from semantic misalignment and kinematic artifacts. Through analysis, we
identify severe gradient attenuation in the deep layers of the network as a key
bottleneck, leading to insufficient learning of high-level features. To address
this issue, we propose \textbf{LUMA} (\textit{\textbf{L}ow-dimension
\textbf{U}nified \textbf{M}otion \textbf{A}lignment}), a text-to-motion
diffusion model that incorporates dual-path anchoring to enhance semantic
alignment. The first path incorporates a lightweight MoCLIP model trained via
contrastive learning without relying on external data, offering semantic
supervision in the temporal domain. The second path introduces complementary
alignment signals in the frequency domain, extracted from low-frequency DCT
components known for their rich semantic content. These two anchors are
adaptively fused through a temporal modulation mechanism, allowing the model to
progressively transition from coarse alignment to fine-grained semantic
refinement throughout the denoising process. Experimental results on HumanML3D
and KIT-ML demonstrate that LUMA achieves state-of-the-art performance, with
FID scores of 0.035 and 0.123, respectively. Furthermore, LUMA accelerates
convergence by 1.4$\times$ compared to the baseline, making it an efficient and
scalable solution for high-fidelity text-to-motion generation.

### [2] [Editing Physiological Signals in Videos Using Latent Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25348)
*Tianwen Zhou,Akshay Paruchuri,Josef Spjut,Kaan Akşit*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种学习框架来编辑视频中的生理信号（心率），同时保持视觉保真度，以解决基于摄像头的生理信号估计带来的隐私问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于摄像头的生理信号估计虽然提供了非接触式的心率监测便利，但面部视频中的生命信号会暴露个人健康和情绪状态等敏感信息，引发严重的隐私担忧。

Method: 使用预训练的3D变分自编码器将输入视频编码到潜在空间，通过冻结的文本编码器嵌入目标心率提示，使用带有自适应层归一化的可训练时空层进行融合，并在解码器中应用特征级线性调制和微调输出层以避免生理信号在重建过程中退化。

Result: 在选定数据集上平均PSNR为38.96 dB，SSIM为0.98，使用最先进的rPPG估计器实现了平均心率调制误差为10.00 bpm MAE和10.09% MAPE。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效保护视觉质量的同时精确调制生理信号，可用于匿名化真实视频中的生物特征信号或合成具有所需生命体征的逼真视频。

Abstract: Camera-based physiological signal estimation provides a non-contact and
convenient means to monitor Heart Rate (HR). However, the presence of vital
signals in facial videos raises significant privacy concerns, as they can
reveal sensitive personal information related to the health and emotional
states of an individual. To address this, we propose a learned framework that
edits physiological signals in videos while preserving visual fidelity. First,
we encode an input video into a latent space via a pretrained 3D Variational
Autoencoder (3D VAE), while a target HR prompt is embedded through a frozen
text encoder. We fuse them using a set of trainable spatio-temporal layers with
Adaptive Layer Normalizations (AdaLN) to capture the strong temporal coherence
of remote Photoplethysmography (rPPG) signals. We apply Feature-wise Linear
Modulation (FiLM) in the decoder with a fine-tuned output layer to avoid the
degradation of physiological signals during reconstruction, enabling accurate
physiological modulation in the reconstructed video. Empirical results show
that our method preserves visual quality with an average PSNR of 38.96 dB and
SSIM of 0.98 on selected datasets, while achieving an average HR modulation
error of 10.00 bpm MAE and 10.09% MAPE using a state-of-the-art rPPG estimator.
Our design's controllable HR editing is useful for applications such as
anonymizing biometric signals in real videos or synthesizing realistic videos
with desired vital signs.

*Paul Gavrikov,Wei Lin,M. Jehanzeb Mirza,Soumya Jahagirdar,Muhammad Huzaifa,Sivan Doveh,Serena Yeung-Levy,James Glass,Hilde Kuehne*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VisualOverload是一个新的视觉问答基准，包含2720个问题-答案对，专门测试VLMs在密集场景中的视觉理解能力。现有模型在该基准上表现不佳，最佳模型仅达到69.5%的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前VQA数据集主要关注全局图像理解，但现有基准可能高估了VLMs的性能。作者认为在密集场景中进行细节编码和推理对VLMs仍然具有挑战性。

Method: 使用高分辨率公共领域绘画扫描图像，这些图像包含多个角色、动作和详细背景。手动标注了六类任务的问题来全面测试场景理解能力。

Result: 测试了37个模型，最佳模型(o3)在最难测试集上仅达到19.6%准确率，所有问题上的总体准确率为69.5%。错误分析揭示了多种失败模式，包括计数能力不足、OCR失败和逻辑不一致。

Conclusion: VisualOverload揭示了当前视觉模型在密集场景理解方面存在关键差距，为开发更好的模型提供了重要资源。

Abstract: Is basic visual understanding really solved in state-of-the-art VLMs? We
present VisualOverload, a slightly different visual question answering (VQA)
benchmark comprising 2,720 question-answer pairs, with privately held
ground-truth responses. Unlike prior VQA datasets that typically focus on near
global image understanding, VisualOverload challenges models to perform simple,
knowledge-free vision tasks in densely populated (or, overloaded) scenes. Our
dataset consists of high-resolution scans of public-domain paintings that are
populated with multiple figures, actions, and unfolding subplots set against
elaborately detailed backdrops. We manually annotated these images with
questions across six task categories to probe for a thorough understanding of
the scene. We hypothesize that current benchmarks overestimate the performance
of VLMs, and encoding and reasoning over details is still a challenging task
for them, especially if they are confronted with densely populated scenes.
Indeed, we observe that even the best model (o3) out of 37 tested models only
achieves 19.6% accuracy on our hardest test split and overall 69.5% accuracy on
all questions. Beyond a thorough evaluation, we complement our benchmark with
an error analysis that reveals multiple failure modes, including a lack of
counting skills, failure in OCR, and striking logical inconsistencies under
complex tasks. Altogether, VisualOverload exposes a critical gap in current
vision models and offers a crucial resource for the community to develop better
models.

### [4] [SpinBench: Perspective and Rotation as a Lens on Spatial Reasoning in VLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25390)
*Yuyou Zhang,Radu Corcodel,Chiori Hori,Anoop Cherian,Ding Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SpinBench是一个用于评估视觉语言模型空间推理能力的诊断基准，重点关注视角转换下的空间推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉语言模型在空间推理方面存在系统性弱点，特别是视角转换能力不足，需要专门的诊断工具来评估和改进。

Method: 设计了围绕视角转换核心挑战的细粒度诊断类别，包括平移、旋转、物体相对姿态和视角变化，从简单单物体任务逐步过渡到复杂多物体视角转换任务。

Result: 评估了37个最先进的视觉语言模型，发现存在强烈的自我中心偏见、旋转理解能力差、在对称和句法重构下表现不一致等问题。人类准确率高达91.2%，任务难度与VLM准确率强相关。

Conclusion: SpinBench为理解VLM的空间推理能力提供了关键见解，揭示了它们在物理空间推理方面的主要差距，并捕捉了人类和VLM共享的空间推理挑战。

Abstract: We present SpinBench, a cognitively grounded diagnostic benchmark for
evaluating spatial reasoning in vision language models (VLMs). SpinBench is
designed around the core challenge of spatial reasoning: perspective taking,
the ability to reason about how scenes and object relations change under
viewpoint transformation. Since perspective taking requires multiple cognitive
capabilities, such as recognizing objects across views, relative positions
grounding, and mentally simulating transformations, SpinBench introduces a set
of fine-grained diagnostic categories. Our categories target translation,
rotation, object relative pose, and viewpoint change, and are progressively
structured so that single-object simpler tasks scaffold toward the most
demanding multi-object perspective-taking setting. We evaluate 37
state-of-the-art VLMs, both proprietary and open source. Results reveal
systematic weaknesses: strong egocentric bias, poor rotational understanding,
and inconsistencies under symmetrical and syntactic reformulations. Scaling
analysis shows both smooth improvements and emergent capabilities. While human
subjects achieve high accuracy (91.2\%), task difficulty as measured by human
response time shows strong correlation with VLM accuracy, indicating that
SpinBench captures spatial reasoning challenges shared across humans and VLMs.
We believe SpinBench provides critical insights into spatial reasoning in VLMs
and highlights key gaps in their ability to reason about physical space. Our

### [5] [FinCap: Topic-Aligned Captions for Short-Form Financial YouTube Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25745)
*Siddhant Sukhani,Yash Bhardwaj,Riya Bhadani,Veer Kejriwal,Michael Galarnyk,Sudheer Chava*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 评估多模态大语言模型在金融短视频主题对齐字幕生成中的表现，测试了文本、音频、视频七种模态组合在五个主题上的效果，发现视频模态在四个主题上表现强劲，某些双模态组合优于三模态组合。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 建立金融短视频字幕生成的基准，探索多模态模型在理解复杂视觉线索方面的潜力和挑战。

Method: 使用624个标注的YouTube短视频，测试文本(T)、音频(A)、视频(V)的七种模态组合，评估五个主题：主要推荐、情感分析、视频目的、视觉分析、金融实体识别。

Result: 视频单独在五个主题中的四个表现强劲；某些双模态组合（如TV或AV）优于三模态TAV组合；过多模态可能引入噪声。

Conclusion: 建立了金融短视频字幕生成的第一个基准，展示了多模态模型在该领域的潜力，但也揭示了模态组合的复杂性挑战。

Abstract: We evaluate multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for topic-aligned
captioning in financial short-form videos (SVs) by testing joint reasoning over
transcripts (T), audio (A), and video (V). Using 624 annotated YouTube SVs, we
assess all seven modality combinations (T, A, V, TA, TV, AV, TAV) across five
topics: main recommendation, sentiment analysis, video purpose, visual
analysis, and financial entity recognition. Video alone performs strongly on
four of five topics, underscoring its value for capturing visual context and
effective cues such as emotions, gestures, and body language. Selective pairs
such as TV or AV often surpass TAV, implying that too many modalities may
introduce noise. These results establish the first baselines for financial
short-form video captioning and illustrate the potential and challenges of
grounding complex visual cues in this domain. All code and data can be found on
our Github under the CC-BY-NC-SA 4.0 license.

### [6] [A Deep Learning Approach for Spatio-Temporal Forecasting of InSAR Ground Deformation in Eastern Ireland](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25393)
*Wendong Yao,Binhua Huang,Soumyabrata Dev*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了多模态时空Transformer（MM-STT）框架，通过融合动态位移数据和静态物理先验来预测高分辨率地面沉降，在EGMS数据集上实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法如ConvLSTM难以建模长程依赖关系，且先前工作主要局限于单模态数据范式，无法充分利用多源信息。

Method: 使用联合时空注意力机制统一处理多模态特征，将动态位移数据与静态物理先验进行深度融合。

Result: 在EGMS数据集上建立了新的最先进水平，相比包括STGCN和STAEformer在内的所有基线方法，将长程预测的RMSE降低了一个数量级。

Conclusion: 对于这类问题，架构内在的多模态深度融合能力对于实现变革性性能至关重要。

Abstract: Forecasting high-resolution land subsidence is a critical yet challenging
task due to its complex, non-linear dynamics. While standard architectures like
ConvLSTM often fail to model long-range dependencies, we argue that a more
fundamental limitation of prior work lies in the uni-modal data paradigm. To
address this, we propose the Multi-Modal Spatio-Temporal Transformer (MM-STT),
a novel framework that fuses dynamic displacement data with static physical
priors. Its core innovation is a joint spatio-temporal attention mechanism that
processes all multi-modal features in a unified manner. On the public EGMS
dataset, MM-STT establishes a new state-of-the-art, reducing the long-range
forecast RMSE by an order of magnitude compared to all baselines, including
SOTA methods like STGCN and STAEformer. Our results demonstrate that for this
class of problems, an architecture's inherent capacity for deep multi-modal
fusion is paramount for achieving transformative performance.

### [7] [DepthLM: Metric Depth From Vision Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25413)
*Zhipeng Cai,Ching-Feng Yeh,Hu Xu,Zhuang Liu,Gregory Meyer,Xinjie Lei,Changsheng Zhao,Shang-Wen Li,Vikas Chandra,Yangyang Shi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Vision language models can achieve expert级精度在3D深度估计任务中，通过文本监督微调和视觉提示技术，无需复杂架构或损失函数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前最先进的视觉语言模型在3D理解方面表现不佳，而专业视觉模型在深度估计任务中能达到超人类精度。研究探索视觉语言模型是否能在不改变架构或损失函数的情况下达到专家级精度。

Method: 采用基于文本的监督微调与稀疏标签，结合视觉提示和内在参数条件增强来解决像素参考和跨数据集相机模糊性问题。

Result: DepthLM方法在深度估计精度上超越最先进视觉语言模型2倍以上，首次使视觉语言模型可与纯视觉模型相媲美，同时自然避免了过度平滑问题。

Conclusion: 视觉语言模型通过简单方法即可解锁强大的3D理解能力，单一模型可覆盖多种3D任务，证明了视觉语言模型在3D理解方面的潜力。

Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) can flexibly address various vision tasks
through text interactions. Although successful in semantic understanding,
state-of-the-art VLMs including GPT-5 still struggle in understanding 3D from
2D inputs. On the other hand, expert pure vision models achieve super-human
accuracy in metric depth estimation, a key 3D understanding task. However, they
require task-specific architectures and losses. Such difference motivates us to
ask: Can VLMs reach expert-level accuracy without architecture or loss change?
We take per-pixel metric depth estimation as the representative task and show
that the answer is yes! Surprisingly, comprehensive analysis shows that
text-based supervised-finetuning with sparse labels is sufficient for VLMs to
unlock strong 3D understanding, no dense prediction head or complex
regression/regularization loss is needed. The bottleneck for VLMs lies actually
in pixel reference and cross-dataset camera ambiguity, which we address through
visual prompting and intrinsic-conditioned augmentation. With much smaller
models, our method DepthLM surpasses the accuracy of most advanced VLMs by over
2x, making VLMs for the first time comparable with pure vision models.
Interestingly, without explicit enforcement during training, VLMs trained with
DepthLM naturally avoids over-smoothing, having much fewer flying points at
boundary regions than pure vision models. The simplicity of DepthLM also
enables a single VLM to cover various 3D tasks beyond metric depth. Our code
and model will be released at the link below.

### [8] [Bayesian Transformer for Pan-Arctic Sea Ice Concentration Mapping and Uncertainty Estimation using Sentinel-1, RCM, and AMSR2 Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25437)
*Mabel Heffring,Lincoln Linlin Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的贝叶斯Transformer方法，用于泛北极海冰浓度制图和不确定性量化，结合了Sentinel-1、RCM和AMSR2数据，实现了高分辨率海冰制图和可靠的不确定性估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高分辨率泛北极海冰制图及其可靠的不确定性估计对于业务化海冰浓度制图至关重要，但由于海冰特征细微、模型不确定性和数据异质性等挑战而难以实现。

Method: 设计了一个新颖的高分辨率Transformer模型，包含全局和局部模块以更好识别海冰模式的细微差异；设计了该Transformer模型的贝叶斯扩展，将参数视为随机变量以更有效捕获不确定性；在决策级融合三种不同类型数据（Sentinel-1、RCM和AMSR2）来解决数据异质性。

Result: 在2021年9月的泛北极数据集上测试，结果表明所提模型相比其他不确定性量化方法，能够同时实现高分辨率海冰浓度制图和稳健的不确定性制图。

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了泛北极海冰制图中的关键挑战，为业务化海冰监测提供了可靠的技术支持。

Abstract: Although high-resolution mapping of Pan-Arctic sea ice with reliable
corresponding uncertainty is essential for operational sea ice concentration
(SIC) charting, it is a difficult task due to some key challenges, e.g., the
subtle nature of ice signature features, model uncertainty, and data
heterogeneity. This letter presents a novel Bayesian Transformer approach for
Pan-Arctic SIC mapping and uncertainty quantification using Sentinel-1,
RADARSAT Constellation Mission (RCM), and Advanced Microwave Scanning
Radiometer 2 (AMSR2) data. First, to improve feature extraction, we design a
novel high-resolution Transformer model with both global and local modules that
can better discern the subtle differences in sea ice patterns. Second, to
improve uncertainty quantification, we design a Bayesian extension of the
proposed Transformer model, treating its parameters as random variables to more
effectively capture uncertainties. Third, to address data heterogeneity, we
fuse three different data types (Sentinel-1, RCM, and AMSR2) at decision-level
to improve both SIC mapping and uncertainty quantification. The proposed
approach is tested on Pan-Arctic datasets from September 2021, and the results
demonstrate that the proposed model can achieve both high-resolution SIC maps
and robust uncertainty maps compared to other uncertainty quantification
approaches.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究开发了一种基于路边摄像头和LiDAR传感器的车辆检测与定位框架，采用卡尔曼滤波的后期融合策略，在复杂道路环境中实现精确的车辆轨迹跟踪。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决基于基础设施的感知系统在复杂道路环境（如施工区）中面临的角度失真、几何复杂、遮挡和成本等实际部署障碍。

Method: 集成路边摄像头和LiDAR传感器到协同仿真环境，采用卡尔曼滤波的后期融合策略来增强轨迹一致性和准确性。

Result: 仿真中融合算法将纵向误差降低达70%，横向精度保持在1-3米内；现场验证显示融合轨迹能准确匹配真实车辆路径，即使在单传感器数据中断或降级时。

Conclusion: 基于卡尔曼滤波的传感器融合能可靠补偿单个传感器的局限性，为复杂交通环境中的主动安全措施提供了实用的基础设施多传感器系统部署路径。

Abstract: Infrastructure-based sensing and real-time trajectory generation show promise
for improving safety in high-risk roadway segments such as work zones, yet
practical deployments are hindered by perspective distortion, complex geometry,
occlusions, and costs. This study tackles these barriers by integrating
roadside camera and LiDAR sensors into a cosimulation environment to develop a
scalable, cost-effective vehicle detection and localization framework, and
employing a Kalman Filter-based late fusion strategy to enhance trajectory
consistency and accuracy. In simulation, the fusion algorithm reduced
longitudinal error by up to 70 percent compared to individual sensors while
preserving lateral accuracy within 1 to 3 meters. Field validation in an active
work zone, using LiDAR, a radar-camera rig, and RTK-GPS as ground truth,
demonstrated that the fused trajectories closely match real vehicle paths, even
when single-sensor data are intermittent or degraded. These results confirm
that KF based sensor fusion can reliably compensate for individual sensor
limitations, providing precise and robust vehicle tracking capabilities. Our
approach thus offers a practical pathway to deploy infrastructure-enabled
multi-sensor systems for proactive safety measures in complex traffic
environments.

*Kaiqing Lin,Zhiyuan Yan,Ruoxin Chen,Junyan Ye,Ke-Yue Zhang,Yue Zhou,Peng Jin,Bin Li,Taiping Yao,Shouhong Ding*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Forensic-Chat方法，通过"先感知后推理"的新范式，让多模态大语言模型在检测AI生成图像时先学会感知伪造痕迹，再进行推理判断，解决了现有MLLMs在图像伪造检测中的性能不佳问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLMs在AI生成图像检测中表现不佳，根本原因在于视觉编码器主要针对语义识别优化，对低级别伪造痕迹不敏感，且微调数据与预训练分布差异大，导致模型依赖语言捷径而非真实视觉证据。

Method: 提出"先感知后推理"范式，开发Forensic-Chat助手，通过强化伪造痕迹感知能力，使后续推理基于实际观察；同时构建ExplainFake-Bench基准从五个关键方面评估MLLMs在图像取证中的可解释性。

Result: 实验表明该方法在泛化性和真正可靠的可解释性方面表现出优越性能。

Conclusion: 通过先训练模型感知伪造痕迹再推理的新范式，能够显著提升MLLMs在AI生成图像检测中的性能，实现更好的泛化能力和可靠的可解释性。

Abstract: Detecting AI-generated images with multimodal large language models (MLLMs)
has gained increasing attention, due to their rich world knowledge,
common-sense reasoning, and potential for explainability. However, naively
applying those MLLMs for detection often leads to suboptimal performance. We
argue that the root of this failure lies in a fundamental mismatch: MLLMs are
asked to reason about fakes before they can truly see them. First, they do not
really see: existing MLLMs' vision encoders are primarily optimized for
semantic-oriented recognition rather than the perception of low-level signals,
leaving them insensitive to subtle forgery traces. Without access to reliable
perceptual evidence, the model grounds its judgment on incomplete and limited
visual observations. Second, existing finetuning data for detection typically
uses narrow, instruction-style formats, which diverge sharply from the diverse,
heterogeneous distributions seen in pretraining. In the absence of meaningful
visual cues, the model therefore exploits these linguistic shortcuts, resulting
in catastrophic forgetting of pretrained knowledge (even the basic dialogue
capabilities). In response, we advocate for a new paradigm: seeing before
reasoning. We propose that MLLMs should first be trained to perceive
artifacts-strengthening their artifact-aware visual perception-so that
subsequent reasoning is grounded in actual observations. We therefore propose
Forensic-Chat, a generalizable, explainable, and still-conversational (for
multi-round dialogue) assistant for fake image detection. We also propose
ExplainFake-Bench, a benchmark tailored for the evaluation of the MLLM's
explainability for image forensics from five key aspects. Extensive experiments
show its superiority of generalization and genuinely reliable explainability.

*Odin Kohler,Rahul Vijaykumar,Masudul H. Imtiaz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种基于视线追踪的实时深度伪造检测方法，利用视频会议中深度伪造无法模仿真实人类对话时的自然视线模式这一特性进行检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着深度伪造技术的进步，恶意行为者开始在视频会议中进行实时网络钓鱼攻击。由于深度伪造无法模仿真实人类对话时的微妙非语言视线交流，这为检测提供了机会。

Method: 基于对二元对话中视线模式研究的仔细分析，选择可解释的特征构建模型，利用恶意行为者视频流中估计的视线信息来检测深度伪造。

Result: 在自建的新数据集上测试，模型达到了82%的准确率。

Conclusion: 这是首个利用视线点追踪进行深度伪造检测的方法，为实时深度伪造检测提供了新的生物特征信息途径。

Abstract: With recent advancements in deepfake technology, it is now possible to
generate convincing deepfakes in real-time. Unfortunately, malicious actors
have started to use this new technology to perform real-time phishing attacks
during video meetings. The nature of a video call allows access to what the
deepfake is ``seeing,'' that is, the screen displayed to the malicious actor.
Using this with the estimated gaze from the malicious actors streamed video
enables us to estimate where the deepfake is looking on screen, the point of
gaze. Because the point of gaze during conversations is not random and is
instead used as a subtle nonverbal communicator, it can be used to detect
deepfakes, which are not capable of mimicking this subtle nonverbal
communication. This paper proposes a real-time deepfake detection method
adapted to this genre of attack, utilizing previously unavailable biometric
information. We built our model based on explainable features selected after
careful review of research on gaze patterns during dyadic conversations. We
then test our model on a novel dataset of our creation, achieving an accuracy
of 82\%. This is the first reported method to utilize point-of-gaze tracking
for deepfake detection.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于视觉的6自由度物体姿态估计算法，针对火星样本返回任务中的机械臂操作需求，在硬件受限条件下实现鲁棒的姿态估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决火星样本返回任务中机械臂在低间隙条件下精确定位多个目标物体的需求，特别是在硬件资源严重受限的环境下。

Method: 使用自定义渲染器和针对边缘域设计的新模板匹配度量，仅需低精度、无纹理的3D模型作为输入。

Result: 在合成数据集、地球物理测试台和火星实地图像上的广泛评估表明，该方法在计算和内存受限的定位任务中，在鲁棒性和准确性方面均优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 该方法为通用硬件上的廉价可靠定位开辟了新的可能性。

Abstract: We consider the problem of vision-based 6-DoF object pose estimation in the
context of the notional Mars Sample Return campaign, in which a robotic arm
would need to localize multiple objects of interest for low-clearance pickup
and insertion, under severely constrained hardware. We propose a novel
localization algorithm leveraging a custom renderer together with a new
template matching metric tailored to the edge domain to achieve robust pose
estimation using only low-fidelity, textureless 3D models as inputs. Extensive
evaluations on synthetic datasets as well as from physical testbeds on Earth
and in situ Mars imagery shows that our method consistently beats the state of
the art in compute and memory-constrained localization, both in terms of
robustness and accuracy, in turn enabling new possibilities for cheap and
reliable localization on general-purpose hardware.

*Pranav Saxena,Avigyan Bhattacharya,Ji Zhang,Wenshan Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出LLM-RG混合方法，结合视觉语言模型和大型语言模型，通过符号推理解决户外驾驶场景中的指称定位问题，在Talk2Car基准上显著优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 户外驾驶场景中的指称定位面临场景变化大、视觉相似物体多、动态元素复杂等挑战，传统方法难以准确解析自然语言指称（如"右边的黑色汽车"）。

Method: 结合现成的视觉语言模型进行细粒度属性提取和大型语言模型进行符号推理，通过提取相关对象类型和属性、检测候选区域、生成丰富视觉描述符，结合空间元数据输入LLM进行思维链推理来识别指称边界框。

Result: 在Talk2Car基准测试中，LLM-RG相比LLM和VLM基线方法取得了显著提升，消融实验显示添加3D空间线索能进一步改善定位效果。

Conclusion: 研究证明了视觉语言模型和大型语言模型在零样本设置下的互补优势，能够实现鲁棒的户外指称定位。

Abstract: Referential grounding in outdoor driving scenes is challenging due to large
scene variability, many visually similar objects, and dynamic elements that
complicate resolving natural-language references (e.g., "the black car on the
right"). We propose LLM-RG, a hybrid pipeline that combines off-the-shelf
vision-language models for fine-grained attribute extraction with large
language models for symbolic reasoning. LLM-RG processes an image and a
free-form referring expression by using an LLM to extract relevant object types
and attributes, detecting candidate regions, generating rich visual descriptors
with a VLM, and then combining these descriptors with spatial metadata into
natural-language prompts that are input to an LLM for chain-of-thought
reasoning to identify the referent's bounding box. Evaluated on the Talk2Car
benchmark, LLM-RG yields substantial gains over both LLM and VLM-based
baselines. Additionally, our ablations show that adding 3D spatial cues further
improves grounding. Our results demonstrate the complementary strengths of VLMs
and LLMs, applied in a zero-shot manner, for robust outdoor referential
grounding.

### [14] [VISOR++: Universal Visual Inputs based Steering for Large Vision Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25533)
*Ravikumar Balakrishnan,Mansi Phute*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了VISOR++方法，通过优化的视觉输入实现对视觉语言模型的行为控制，无需运行时访问模型内部，适用于开放和闭源模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有行为控制方法存在局限性：系统提示容易被用户指令覆盖，基于激活的转向向量需要侵入式运行时模型访问，无法用于API服务和闭源模型。

Method: 通过生成优化的视觉输入（VISOR++图像）来诱导目标激活模式，实现对模型行为的转向控制，支持模型特定和联合优化的图像生成。

Result: 在LLaVA-1.5-7B和IDEFICS2-8B等模型上，VISOR++图像在拒绝、奉承和生存本能三个对齐方向上达到与转向向量相当的性能，对未见模型也有效，且在14,000个MMLU评估任务上保持99.9%的性能。

Conclusion: VISOR++提供了一种部署无关的行为控制方法，仅通过视觉输入即可实现有效的模型行为转向，适用于各种视觉语言模型。

Abstract: As Vision Language Models (VLMs) are deployed across safety-critical
applications, understanding and controlling their behavioral patterns has
become increasingly important. Existing behavioral control methods face
significant limitations: system prompting approaches could easily be overridden
by user instructions, while applying activation-based steering vectors requires
invasive runtime access to model internals, precluding deployment with
API-based services and closed-source models. Finding steering methods that
transfer across multiple VLMs is still an open area of research. To this end,
we introduce universal visual input based steering for output redirection
(VISOR++), to achieve behavioral control through optimized visual inputs alone.
We demonstrate that a single VISOR++ image can be generated for an ensemble of
VLMs to emulate each of their steering vectors. By crafting universal visual
inputs that induce target activation patterns, VISOR++ eliminates the need for
runtime model access while remaining deployment-agnostic. This means that when
an underlying model supports multimodal capability, model behaviors can be
steered by inserting an image input replacing runtime steering vector based
interventions. We first demonstrate the effectiveness of the VISOR++ images on
open-access models such as LLaVA-1.5-7B and IDEFICS2-8B along three alignment
directions: refusal, sycophancy and survival instinct. Both the model-specific
steering images and the jointly optimized images achieve performance parity
closely following that of steering vectors for both positive and negative
steering tasks. We also show the promise of VISOR++ images in achieving
directional behavioral shifts for unseen models including both open-access and
closed-access ones. Furthermore, VISOR++ images are able to preserve 99.9%
performance on 14,000 unrelated MMLU evaluation tasks.

TL;DR: Vision-Zero是一个无需人工标注的视觉语言模型自增强框架，通过任意图像对生成竞争性视觉游戏，实现模型自我提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前强化学习增强视觉语言模型推理能力时对人工标注数据的高度依赖问题，降低训练成本，促进实际部署。

Method: 采用战略自对弈框架，让模型在"谁是卧底"式游戏中扮演不同角色进行推理；引入迭代自对弈策略优化算法，结合自对弈和可验证奖励的强化学习。

Result: 在推理、图表问答和视觉理解任务上达到最先进性能，超越其他基于标注的方法，展现出强大的跨领域泛化能力。

Conclusion: Vision-Zero证明了无需人工标注即可有效提升视觉语言模型推理能力的可行性，为模型自增强提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Although reinforcement learning (RL) can effectively enhance the reasoning
capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs), current methods remain heavily
dependent on labor-intensive datasets that require extensive manual
construction and verification, leading to extremely high training costs and
consequently constraining the practical deployment of VLMs. To address this
challenge, we propose Vision-Zero, a domain-agnostic framework enabling VLM
self-improvement through competitive visual games generated from arbitrary
image pairs. Specifically, Vision-Zero encompasses three main attributes: (1)
Strategic Self-Play Framework: Vision-Zero trains VLMs in "Who Is the
Spy"-style games, where the models engage in strategic reasoning and actions
across multiple roles. Through interactive gameplay, models autonomously
generate their training data without human annotation. (2) Gameplay from
Arbitrary Images: Unlike existing gamified frameworks, Vision-Zero can generate
games from arbitrary images, thereby enhancing the model's reasoning ability
across diverse domains and showing strong generalization to different tasks. We
demonstrate this versatility using three distinct types of image datasets:
CLEVR-based synthetic scenes, charts, and real-world images. (3) Sustainable
Performance Gain: We introduce Iterative Self-Play Policy Optimization
(Iterative-SPO), a novel training algorithm that alternates between Self-Play
and reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR), mitigating the
performance plateau often seen in self-play-only training and achieving
sustained long-term improvements. Despite using label-free data, Vision-Zero
achieves state-of-the-art performance on reasoning, chart question answering,
and vision-centric understanding tasks, surpassing other annotation-based
methods. Models and code has been released at

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合数学/聚类分割模型与U-Net的混合方法，用于脉络膜痣的精确分割，在1024*1024眼底图像上达到89.7%的Dice系数和80.01%的IoU，优于Attention U-Net模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 脉络膜痣有转化为黑色素瘤的风险，早期检测至关重要。现有AI诊断方法在眼底图像分割上面临挑战，特别是对于非专业临床医生。现有数据集分辨率低、标注不一致，限制了分割模型的效果。

Method: 提出新颖的混合方法，将数学/聚类分割模型与U-Net的见解相结合，充分利用两种方法的优势。该方法减少了对大规模训练数据的需求。

Result: 在1024*1024眼底图像上，提出的混合模型达到89.7%的Dice系数和80.01%的IoU，显著优于Attention U-Net的51.3%和34.2%。在外部数据集上表现出更好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 这项工作是为脉络膜痣诊断开发决策支持系统的更广泛努力的一部分，具有在自动病变标注中应用的潜力，可提高诊断和监测的速度和准确性。

Abstract: Choroidal nevi are common benign pigmented lesions in the eye, with a small
risk of transforming into melanoma. Early detection is critical to improving
survival rates, but misdiagnosis or delayed diagnosis can lead to poor
outcomes. Despite advancements in AI-based image analysis, diagnosing choroidal
nevi in colour fundus images remains challenging, particularly for clinicians
without specialized expertise. Existing datasets often suffer from low
resolution and inconsistent labelling, limiting the effectiveness of
segmentation models. This paper addresses the challenge of achieving precise
segmentation of fundus lesions, a critical step toward developing robust
diagnostic tools. While deep learning models like U-Net have demonstrated
effectiveness, their accuracy heavily depends on the quality and quantity of
annotated data. Previous mathematical/clustering segmentation methods, though
accurate, required extensive human input, making them impractical for medical
applications. This paper proposes a novel approach that combines
mathematical/clustering segmentation models with insights from U-Net,
leveraging the strengths of both methods. This hybrid model improves accuracy,
reduces the need for large-scale training data, and achieves significant
performance gains on high-resolution fundus images. The proposed model achieves
a Dice coefficient of 89.7% and an IoU of 80.01% on 1024*1024 fundus images,
outperforming the Attention U-Net model, which achieved 51.3% and 34.2%,
respectively. It also demonstrated better generalizability on external
datasets. This work forms a part of a broader effort to develop a decision
support system for choroidal nevus diagnosis, with potential applications in
automated lesion annotation to enhance the speed and accuracy of diagnosis and
monitoring.

Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在专业科学领域如海洋生物学中的能力尚未充分探索，特别是在细粒度鱼类物种识别方面存在显著局限性，这对在人为压力下监测海洋生态系统至关重要。

Method: 通过系统评估最先进的多模态大语言模型，发现其在鱼类物种识别方面的不足，并引入FishNet++大规模多模态基准数据集，包含35,133个文本描述、706,426个关键点标注和119,399个边界框。

Conclusion: FishNet++基准数据集为开发专门针对水生科学的多模态视觉语言模型提供了全面支持，有助于推动该领域的研究进展。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive
cross-domain capabilities, yet their proficiency in specialized scientific
fields like marine biology remains underexplored. In this work, we
systematically evaluate state-of-the-art MLLMs and reveal significant
limitations in their ability to perform fine-grained recognition of fish
species, with the best open-source models achieving less than 10\% accuracy.
This task is critical for monitoring marine ecosystems under anthropogenic
pressure. To address this gap and investigate whether these failures stem from
a lack of domain knowledge, we introduce FishNet++, a large-scale, multimodal
benchmark. FishNet++ significantly extends existing resources with 35,133
textual descriptions for multimodal learning, 706,426 key-point annotations for
morphological studies, and 119,399 bounding boxes for detection. By providing
this comprehensive suite of annotations, our work facilitates the development

aquatic science.

Motivation: 现有ViG框架中的节点-邻居特征聚合方法缺乏能够有效捕捉复杂节点关系且无需架构特定优化的通用方案。

Method: 提出交叉注意力聚合方法，节点提供查询投影，邻居提供键投影，并构建AttentionViG架构进行非局部消息传递。

Result: 在ImageNet-1K基准测试中达到SOTA性能，在MS COCO 2017的目标检测、实例分割以及ADE20K的语义分割任务中展现出良好的迁移能力。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅实现了强大的性能，而且保持了效率，在与先前视觉GNN架构相当的FLOPs下提供了有竞争力的准确率。

Abstract: Vision Graph Neural Networks (ViGs) have demonstrated promising performance
in image recognition tasks against Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and
Vision Transformers (ViTs). An essential part of the ViG framework is the
node-neighbor feature aggregation method. Although various graph convolution
methods, such as Max-Relative, EdgeConv, GIN, and GraphSAGE, have been
explored, a versatile aggregation method that effectively captures complex
node-neighbor relationships without requiring architecture-specific refinements
is needed. To address this gap, we propose a cross-attention-based aggregation
method in which the query projections come from the node, while the key
projections come from its neighbors. Additionally, we introduce a novel
architecture called AttentionViG that uses the proposed cross-attention
aggregation scheme to conduct non-local message passing. We evaluated the image
recognition performance of AttentionViG on the ImageNet-1K benchmark, where it
achieved SOTA performance. Additionally, we assessed its transferability to
downstream tasks, including object detection and instance segmentation on MS
COCO 2017, as well as semantic segmentation on ADE20K. Our results demonstrate
that the proposed method not only achieves strong performance, but also
maintains efficiency, delivering competitive accuracy with comparable FLOPs to
prior vision GNN architectures.

TL;DR: 提出了MetaChest数据集用于医学图像的小样本学习，比较了迁移学习和ProtoNet在小样本多标签分类任务中的表现，发现迁移学习方法表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像分析中标注数据稀缺，需要小样本学习方法。现有研究多关注标准小样本学习，而医学应用需要同时学习新类别并利用已知类别知识，更符合广义小样本分类场景。

Method: 构建了包含479,215张胸部X光片的MetaChest数据集，设计了专门用于小样本分类的元集划分和多标签任务生成算法。评估了标准迁移学习方法和ProtoNet扩展方法。

Result: 增加每任务的类别数和每类训练样本数可提升性能；迁移学习方法持续优于ProtoNet扩展；高分辨率图像提高精度但增加计算成本；高效模型架构可达到类似性能但显著减少资源需求。

Conclusion: 迁移学习方法在医学图像小样本多标签分类中表现优异，高效模型架构可在保持性能的同时降低计算成本，为医学图像分析提供了实用的小样本学习解决方案。

Abstract: The limited availability of annotated data presents a major challenge for
applying deep learning methods to medical image analysis. Few-shot learning
methods aim to recognize new classes from only a small number of labeled
examples. These methods are typically studied under the standard few-shot
learning setting, where all classes in a task are new. However, medical
applications such as pathology classification from chest X-rays often require
learning new classes while simultaneously leveraging knowledge of previously
known ones, a scenario more closely aligned with generalized few-shot
classification. Despite its practical relevance, few-shot learning has been
scarcely studied in this context. In this work, we present MetaChest, a
large-scale dataset of 479,215 chest X-rays collected from four public
databases. MetaChest includes a meta-set partition specifically designed for
standard few-shot classification, as well as an algorithm for generating
multi-label episodes. We conduct extensive experiments evaluating both a
standard transfer learning approach and an extension of ProtoNet across a wide
range of few-shot multi-label classification tasks. Our results demonstrate
that increasing the number of classes per episode and the number of training
examples per class improves classification performance. Notably, the transfer
learning approach consistently outperforms the ProtoNet extension, despite not
being tailored for few-shot learning. We also show that higher-resolution
images improve accuracy at the cost of additional computation, while efficient
model architectures achieve comparable performance to larger models with
significantly reduced resource requirements.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SQUARE是一个无需训练的双阶段零样本组合图像检索框架，利用多模态大语言模型增强检索性能，通过语义查询增强融合和高效批量重排来准确捕捉用户意图。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 零样本组合图像检索方法虽然无需特定任务训练或标注数据，但准确捕捉用户意图仍然具有挑战性。现有方法在理解用户指定的文本修改方面存在不足。

Method: 采用两阶段框架：1) 语义查询增强融合阶段，使用MLLM生成目标图像描述来丰富CLIP等VLM的查询嵌入；2) 高效批量重排阶段，将候选图像以网格形式呈现给MLLM进行联合视觉语义推理。

Result: 在四个标准CIR基准测试中表现出色，即使使用轻量级预训练模型也能保持高性能，证明了其潜在适用性。

Conclusion: SQUARE框架简单有效，通过结合MLLM的语义理解能力显著提升了零样本组合图像检索的性能，能够更好地捕捉用户意图。

Abstract: Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) aims to retrieve target images that preserve
the visual content of a reference image while incorporating user-specified
textual modifications. Training-free zero-shot CIR (ZS-CIR) approaches, which
require no task-specific training or labeled data, are highly desirable, yet
accurately capturing user intent remains challenging. In this paper, we present
SQUARE, a novel two-stage training-free framework that leverages Multimodal
Large Language Models (MLLMs) to enhance ZS-CIR. In the Semantic
Query-Augmented Fusion (SQAF) stage, we enrich the query embedding derived from
a vision-language model (VLM) such as CLIP with MLLM-generated captions of the
target image. These captions provide high-level semantic guidance, enabling the
query to better capture the user's intent and improve global retrieval quality.
In the Efficient Batch Reranking (EBR) stage, top-ranked candidates are
presented as an image grid with visual marks to the MLLM, which performs joint
visual-semantic reasoning across all candidates. Our reranking strategy
operates in a single pass and yields more accurate rankings. Experiments show
that SQUARE, with its simplicity and effectiveness, delivers strong performance
on four standard CIR benchmarks. Notably, it maintains high performance even
with lightweight pre-trained, demonstrating its potential applicability.

Conclusion: K-Prism通过统一框架成功整合了临床实践中使用的多种知识范式，实现了灵活且高性能的医学图像分割。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is fundamental to clinical decision-making, yet
existing models remain fragmented. They are usually trained on single knowledge
sources and specific to individual tasks, modalities, or organs. This
fragmentation contrasts sharply with clinical practice, where experts
seamlessly integrate diverse knowledge: anatomical priors from training,
exemplar-based reasoning from reference cases, and iterative refinement through
real-time interaction. We present $\textbf{K-Prism}$, a unified segmentation
framework that mirrors this clinical flexibility by systematically integrating
three knowledge paradigms: (i) $\textit{semantic priors}$ learned from
annotated datasets, (ii) $\textit{in-context knowledge}$ from few-shot
reference examples, and (iii) $\textit{interactive feedback}$ from user inputs
like clicks or scribbles. Our key insight is that these heterogeneous knowledge
sources can be encoded into a dual-prompt representation: 1-D sparse prompts
defining $\textit{what}$ to segment and 2-D dense prompts indicating
$\textit{where}$ to attend, which are then dynamically routed through a
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) decoder. This design enables flexible switching
between paradigms and joint training across diverse tasks without architectural
modifications. Comprehensive experiments on 18 public datasets spanning diverse
modalities (CT, MRI, X-ray, pathology, ultrasound, etc.) demonstrate that
K-Prism achieves state-of-the-art performance across semantic, in-context, and
interactive segmentation settings. Code will be released upon publication.

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了高分辨率整体重建的高成本与用户对局部精细细节需求之间的差距，实现了按需局部高分辨率重建。

Abstract: We perceive our surroundings with an active focus, paying more attention to
regions of interest, such as the shelf labels in a grocery store. When it comes
to scene reconstruction, this human perception trait calls for spatially
varying degrees of detail ready for closer inspection in critical regions,
preferably reconstructed on demand. While recent works in 3D Gaussian Splatting
(3DGS) achieve fast, generalizable reconstruction from sparse views, their
uniform resolution output leads to high computational costs unscalable to
high-resolution training. As a result, they cannot leverage available images at
their original high resolution to reconstruct details. Per-scene optimization
methods reconstruct finer details with adaptive density control, yet require
dense observations and lengthy offline optimization. To bridge the gap between
the prohibitive cost of high-resolution holistic reconstructions and the user
needs for localized fine details, we propose the problem of localized
high-resolution reconstruction via on-demand Gaussian densification. Given a
low-resolution 3DGS reconstruction, the goal is to learn a generalizable
network that densifies the initial 3DGS to capture fine details in a
user-specified local region of interest (RoI), based on sparse high-resolution
observations of the RoI. This formulation avoids the high cost and redundancy
of uniformly high-resolution reconstructions and fully leverages
high-resolution captures in critical regions. We propose GaussianLens, a
feed-forward densification framework that fuses multi-modal information from
the initial 3DGS and multi-view images. We further design a pixel-guided
densification mechanism that effectively captures details under large
resolution increases. Experiments demonstrate our method's superior performance
in local fine detail reconstruction and strong scalability to images of up to
$1024\times1024$ resolution.

Abstract: Vision-threatening eye diseases pose a major global health burden, with
timely diagnosis limited by workforce shortages and restricted access to
specialized care. While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) show promise
for medical image interpretation, advancing MLLMs for ophthalmology is hindered
by the lack of comprehensive benchmark datasets suitable for evaluating
generative models. We present a large-scale multimodal ophthalmology benchmark
comprising 32,633 instances with multi-granular annotations across 12 common
ophthalmic conditions and 5 imaging modalities. The dataset integrates imaging,
anatomical structures, demographics, and free-text annotations, supporting
anatomical structure recognition, disease screening, disease staging, and
demographic prediction for bias evaluation. This work extends our preliminary
LMOD benchmark with three major enhancements: (1) nearly 50% dataset expansion
with substantial enlargement of color fundus photography; (2) broadened task
coverage including binary disease diagnosis, multi-class diagnosis, severity
classification with international grading standards, and demographic
prediction; and (3) systematic evaluation of 24 state-of-the-art MLLMs. Our
evaluations reveal both promise and limitations. Top-performing models achieved
~58% accuracy in disease screening under zero-shot settings, and performance
remained suboptimal for challenging tasks like disease staging. We will
publicly release the dataset, curation pipeline, and leaderboard to potentially
advance ophthalmic AI applications and reduce the global burden of
vision-threatening diseases.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有跨视角物体地理定位方法大多基于锚框范式，这种方法受到预定义锚框的限制。为了消除这种依赖，需要开发无锚框的定位方法。

Method: AFGeo直接预测每个像素到真实框的四个方向偏移量（左、右、上、下），采用高斯位置编码建模查询图像中的点击点位置不确定性，并引入跨视角物体关联模块关联不同视角下的同一物体及其周围环境。

Result: AFGeo模型轻量且计算高效，在基准数据集上达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: AFGeo通过无锚框定位范式，结合高斯位置编码和跨视角物体关联模块，有效解决了跨视角物体地理定位问题，性能优越且计算效率高。

Abstract: Most existing cross-view object geo-localization approaches adopt
anchor-based paradigm. Although effective, such methods are inherently
constrained by predefined anchors. To eliminate this dependency, we first
propose an anchor-free formulation for cross-view object geo-localization,
termed AFGeo. AFGeo directly predicts the four directional offsets (left,
right, top, bottom) to the ground-truth box for each pixel, thereby localizing
the object without any predefined anchors. To obtain a more robust spatial
prior, AFGeo incorporates Gaussian Position Encoding (GPE) to model the click
point in the query image, mitigating the uncertainty of object position that
challenges object localization in cross-view scenarios. In addition, AFGeo
incorporates a Cross-view Object Association Module (CVOAM) that relates the
same object and its surrounding context across viewpoints, enabling reliable
localization under large cross-view appearance gaps. By adopting an anchor-free
localization paradigm that integrates GPE and CVOAM with minimal parameter
overhead, our model is both lightweight and computationally efficient,
achieving state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets.

Motivation: 现有跨模态检索模型在检索融合图像-文本模态的键时性能下降，且传统方法需要精心构建新的数据集，难以泛化到未见过的模态组合

Method: GCL通过在mini-batch内对所有模态执行对比学习，利用现有的图像-文本配对数据集学习统一的表示空间

Abstract: Despite their consistent performance improvements, cross-modal retrieval
models (e.g., CLIP) show degraded performances with retrieving keys composed of
fused image-text modality (e.g., Wikipedia pages with both images and text). To
address this critical challenge, multimodal retrieval has been recently
explored to develop a unified single retrieval model capable of retrieving keys
across diverse modality combinations. A common approach involves constructing
new composed sets of image-text triplets (e.g., retrieving a pair of image and
text given a query image). However, such an approach requires careful curation
to ensure the dataset quality and fails to generalize to unseen modality
combinations. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes Generalized
Contrastive Learning (GCL), a novel loss formulation that improves multimodal
retrieval performance without the burdensome need for new dataset curation.
Specifically, GCL operates by enforcing contrastive learning across all
modalities within a mini-batch, utilizing existing image-caption paired
datasets to learn a unified representation space. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of GCL by showing consistent performance improvements on
off-the-shelf multimodal retrieval models (e.g., VISTA, CLIP, and TinyCLIP)
using the M-BEIR, MMEB, and CoVR benchmarks.

TL;DR: 使用视频游戏生成的合成图像可以有效训练CNN检测真实卡车车轴，最高mAP达到99%，证明合成图像是可靠的低成本训练数据源。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CNN需要大量数据训练，但数据收集成本高昂。视频游戏能生成逼真的3D模型，探索是否可用游戏提取的合成图像训练CNN检测真实卡车车轴。

Method: 创建三个包含真实和合成卡车的数据库，使用三种不同的YOLO架构进行训练和测试，评估召回率、精确率、F1分数和mAP，并应用Mann-Whitney U检验统计显著性。

Result: 视频游戏提取的合成图像被证明是可靠的训练数据源，所有网络性能均有提升，最高mAP达到99%。

Conclusion: 合成图像可用于训练神经网络，为知识提取提供可靠、低成本的数据源。

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) traditionally require large amounts of
data to train models with good performance. However, data collection is an
expensive process, both in time and resources. Generated synthetic images are a
good alternative, with video games producing realistic 3D models. This paper
aims to determine whether images extracted from a video game can be effectively
used to train a CNN to detect real-life truck axles. Three different databases
were created, with real-life and synthetic trucks, to provide training and
testing examples for three different You Only Look Once (YOLO) architectures.
Results were evaluated based on four metrics: recall, precision, F1-score, and
mean Average Precision (mAP). To evaluate the statistical significance of the
results, the Mann-Whitney U test was also applied to the resulting mAP of all
models. Synthetic images from trucks extracted from a video game proved to be a
reliable source of training data, contributing to the performance of all
networks. The highest mAP score reached 99\%. Results indicate that synthetic
images can be used to train neural networks, providing a reliable, low-cost
data source for extracting knowledge.

*Kaiyu Li,Zixuan Jiang,Xiangyong Cao,Jiayu Wang,Yuchen Xiao,Deyu Meng,Zhi Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Geo-DLC任务，即遥感图像的对象级细粒度图像描述，构建了DE-Dataset数据集和DE-Benchmark评估套件，并开发了DescribeEarth多模态大语言模型，在遥感图像描述任务上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有遥感图像描述研究主要关注图像级别，缺乏对象级细粒度解释，无法充分利用遥感图像中丰富的语义和结构信息。

Method: 提出DescribeEarth多模态大语言模型架构，集成尺度自适应聚焦策略和领域引导融合模块，利用遥感视觉语言模型特征编码高分辨率细节和遥感类别先验，同时保持全局上下文。

Result: DescribeEarth模型在DE-Benchmark上持续优于最先进的通用MLLMs，在事实准确性、描述丰富性和语法正确性方面表现优异，特别是在捕捉内在对象特征和周围环境属性方面。

Conclusion: Geo-DLC任务和DescribeEarth模型能够有效解决遥感图像对象级细粒度描述问题，为遥感图像理解提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Automated textual description of remote sensing images is crucial for
unlocking their full potential in diverse applications, from environmental
monitoring to urban planning and disaster management. However, existing studies
in remote sensing image captioning primarily focus on the image level, lacking
object-level fine-grained interpretation, which prevents the full utilization
and transformation of the rich semantic and structural information contained in
remote sensing images. To address this limitation, we propose Geo-DLC, a novel
task of object-level fine-grained image captioning for remote sensing. To
support this task, we construct DE-Dataset, a large-scale dataset contains 25
categories and 261,806 annotated instances with detailed descriptions of object
attributes, relationships, and contexts. Furthermore, we introduce
DE-Benchmark, a LLM-assisted question-answering based evaluation suite designed
to systematically measure model capabilities on the Geo-DLC task. We also
present DescribeEarth, a Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM) architecture
explicitly designed for Geo-DLC, which integrates a scale-adaptive focal
strategy and a domain-guided fusion module leveraging remote sensing
vision-language model features to encode high-resolution details and remote
sensing category priors while maintaining global context. Our DescribeEarth
model consistently outperforms state-of-the-art general MLLMs on DE-Benchmark,
demonstrating superior factual accuracy, descriptive richness, and grammatical
soundness, particularly in capturing intrinsic object features and surrounding
environmental attributes across simple, complex, and even out-of-distribution
remote sensing scenarios. All data, code and weights are released at

TL;DR: 提出基于YOLO的深度学习模型，结合ConSinGAN数据增强技术，用于金属板材表面和孔洞缺陷的自动检测，YOLOv9模型表现最佳，准确率达91.3%，检测时间146毫秒。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决工业制造中人工检测耗时耗力的问题，提高缺陷检测的效率和准确性。

Method: 使用ConSinGAN生成大量金属板材图像数据，结合四种YOLO模型（v3、v4、v7、v9）进行缺陷检测，并将最佳模型集成到SCADA系统中。

Result: YOLOv9模型在结合ConSinGAN数据增强后表现最佳，准确率达到91.3%，检测时间为146毫秒。

Conclusion: 提出的YOLOv9模型结合ConSinGAN数据增强技术能有效提升缺陷检测性能，并成功集成到工业自动化系统中，具有广泛的应用前景。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a YOLO-based deep learning (DL) model for automatic
defect detection to solve the time-consuming and labor-intensive tasks in
industrial manufacturing. In our experiments, the images of metal sheets are
used as the dataset for training the YOLO model to detect the defects on the
surfaces and in the holes of metal sheets. However, the lack of metal sheet
images significantly degrades the performance of detection accuracy. To address
this issue, the ConSinGAN is used to generate a considerable amount of data.
Four versions of the YOLO model (i.e., YOLOv3, v4, v7, and v9) are combined
with the ConSinGAN for data augmentation. The proposed YOLOv9 model with
ConSinGAN outperforms the other YOLO models with an accuracy of 91.3%, and a
detection time of 146 ms. The proposed YOLOv9 model is integrated into
manufacturing hardware and a supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA)
system to establish a practical automated optical inspection (AOI) system.
Additionally, the proposed automated defect detection is easily applied to
other components in industrial manufacturing.

TL;DR: 提出了OmniDFA框架，用于AI生成图像的开集少样本源模型识别，同时构建了包含117万张图像的大型数据集OmniFake。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决AI生成图像检测和源模型归因的挑战，现有方法容易过拟合特定伪造特征，且缺乏大规模分类合成数据集。

Method: 提出开集少样本源识别范式，开发OmniDFA框架进行图像真实性评估和少样本合成源识别，构建OmniFake数据集。

Result: OmniDFA在开集归因方面表现出色，在AIGI检测上达到最先进的泛化性能。

Conclusion: OmniDFA为AI生成图像检测和归因提供了实用解决方案，数据集和代码将公开。

Abstract: AI-generated image (AIGI) detection and source model attribution remain
central challenges in combating deepfake abuses, primarily due to the
structural diversity of generative models. Current detection methods are prone
to overfitting specific forgery traits, whereas source attribution offers a
robust alternative through fine-grained feature discrimination. However,
synthetic image attribution remains constrained by the scarcity of large-scale,
well-categorized synthetic datasets, limiting its practicality and
compatibility with detection systems. In this work, we propose a new paradigm
for image attribution called open-set, few-shot source identification. This
paradigm is designed to reliably identify unseen generators using only limited
samples, making it highly suitable for real-world application. To this end, we
introduce OmniDFA (Omni Detector and Few-shot Attributor), a novel framework
for AIGI that not only assesses the authenticity of images, but also determines
the synthesis origins in a few-shot manner. To facilitate this work, we
construct OmniFake, a large class-aware synthetic image dataset that curates
$1.17$ M images from $45$ distinct generative models, substantially enriching
the foundational resources for research on both AIGI detection and attribution.
Experiments demonstrate that OmniDFA exhibits excellent capability in open-set
attribution and achieves state-of-the-art generalization performance on AIGI
detection. Our dataset and code will be made available.

*Xiping Li,Jianghong Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AIMCoT是一个主动信息驱动的多模态思维链框架，通过上下文增强注意力图生成、主动视觉探测和动态注意力转移触发三个组件，解决了现有方法依赖不可靠注意力图和被动选择策略的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态思维链方法依赖简单的启发式方法构建交错思维链，通常基于注意力图，但经验分析显示这些注意力图不可靠。其被动无目的的选择策略和任意触发机制在捕捉模型认知需求方面存在严重不足。

Method: 提出AIMCoT框架，包含三个协同组件：(1)上下文增强注意力图生成，缓解文本-视觉粒度不平衡；(2)主动视觉探测，基于信息理论主动选择最能帮助回答问题的图像区域；(3)动态注意力转移触发，通过监控文本到视觉的注意力转移智能确定插入视觉信息的最佳时机。

Result: 在三个具有挑战性的基准测试上的广泛实验表明，AIMCoT在不同设置下显著优于最先进的方法。

Conclusion: 通过主动获取信息和动态构建推理过程，AIMCoT代表了向更鲁棒、有效和类人化多模态推理的关键一步。

Abstract: Multimodal Chain-of-Thought (CoT) has emerged as a powerful technique for
enhancing the vision-language reasoning with interleaved information. However,
existing methods often rely on simplistic heuristics for constructing
interleaved CoT, typically depending on attention maps, which our empirical
analysis reveals can be unreliable. What's more, the shortcomings of their
passive and purposeless selection strategies and their arbitrary triggering
mechanisms in capturing the model's cognitive need for information are further
amplified. In this paper, we propose \textbf{AIMCoT}, an \textbf{A}ctive
\textbf{I}nformation-driven \textbf{M}ulti-modal
\textbf{C}hain-\textbf{o}f-\textbf{T}hought framework that addresses these
fundamental limitations. AIMCoT introduces three synergistic components: (1)
\textbf{Context-enhanced Attention-map Generation (CAG)}, which mitigates the
text-vision granularity imbalance, thereby producing more reliable attention
maps as a foundation. (2) \textbf{Active Visual Probing (AVP)}, which replaces
passive selection with a proactive, goal-oriented strategy grounded in
information theory to select image regions that help answer the questions
maximally. (3) \textbf{Dynamic Attention-shifting Trigger (DAT)}, which
intelligently determines the optimal moments to insert visual information by
monitoring the model's text-to-vision attention shifts. Extensive experiments
on three challenging benchmarks demonstrate that AIMCoT significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art methods across different settings. By actively
foraging for information and dynamically structuring its reasoning process,
AIMCoT represents a critical step towards more robust, effective, and
human-like multimodal reasoning. Our code is available at

### [31] [How Diffusion Models Memorize](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25705)
*Juyeop Kim,Songkuk Kim,Jong-Seok Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 扩散模型会记忆训练数据，本文揭示了记忆机制：早期去噪过程中对训练样本的过度估计导致多样性减少、去噪轨迹坍缩，从而加速向记忆图像的收敛。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型存在记忆训练数据的问题，引发隐私和版权担忧，但记忆发生的根本原因尚不明确。本文旨在探究扩散模型如何记忆训练数据。

Method: 通过分析扩散和去噪过程的潜在空间动态，研究训练样本在早期去噪阶段的过度估计如何影响模型行为，包括分解中间潜在变量和观察去噪轨迹。

Result: 发现记忆不能仅用过拟合解释，记忆提示会将训练图像注入噪声预测，强制潜在轨迹收敛，初始随机性被快速抑制并被记忆内容替代，偏离理论去噪计划与记忆严重程度高度相关。

Conclusion: 早期过度估计是扩散模型中记忆现象的核心机制，这解释了记忆如何通过减少多样性、坍缩去噪轨迹和加速收敛而发生。

Abstract: Despite their success in image generation, diffusion models can memorize
training data, raising serious privacy and copyright concerns. Although prior
work has sought to characterize, detect, and mitigate memorization, the
fundamental question of why and how it occurs remains unresolved. In this
paper, we revisit the diffusion and denoising process and analyze latent space
dynamics to address the question: "How do diffusion models memorize?" We show
that memorization is driven by the overestimation of training samples during
early denoising, which reduces diversity, collapses denoising trajectories, and
accelerates convergence toward the memorized image. Specifically: (i)
memorization cannot be explained by overfitting alone, as training loss is
larger under memorization due to classifier-free guidance amplifying
predictions and inducing overestimation; (ii) memorized prompts inject training
images into noise predictions, forcing latent trajectories to converge and
steering denoising toward their paired samples; and (iii) a decomposition of
intermediate latents reveals how initial randomness is quickly suppressed and
replaced by memorized content, with deviations from the theoretical denoising
schedule correlating almost perfectly with memorization severity. Together,
these results identify early overestimation as the central underlying mechanism
of memorization in diffusion models.

### [32] [ProbMed: A Probabilistic Framework for Medical Multimodal Binding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25711)
*Yuan Gao,Sangwook Kim,Jianzhong You,Chris McIntosh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出ProbMED模型，通过概率对比学习处理医学多模态数据中的多对多映射关系，将四种医学模态对齐到统一的概率嵌入空间，在跨模态检索和分类任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前医学视觉语言预训练模型无法直接处理医学数据中常见的多对多映射关系，需要新的方法来建模这种复杂的模态交互。

Method: 使用概率对比学习建模嵌入分布而非确定性估计，采用InfoNCE损失和Hellinger距离整合模态间分布，引入概率合成采样损失改进模态内绑定。

Result: 在13个医学数据集上的实验表明，模型在跨模态检索、零样本和少样本分类任务中优于现有Med-VLPMs，实现了更好的模态间和模态内绑定。

Conclusion: ProbMED通过概率建模有效处理医学多模态数据的多对多映射，为医学决策提供了更强大的多模态集成能力。

Abstract: Medical decision-making requires integrating diverse medical information,
from imaging to clinical narratives. These medical modalities are often
acquired in a many-to-many manner. However, current medical vision-language
pretraining models (Med-VLPMs) fail to directly account for this many-to-many
mapping in their model training and embeddings. To address this, we present
Probabilistic Modality-Enhanced Diagnosis (ProbMED), a multimodal Med-VLPM that
employs probabilistic contrastive learning to model distributions over
embeddings rather than deterministic estimates. ProbMED aligns four distinct
modalities -- chest X-rays, electrocardiograms, echocardiograms, and clinical
text -- into a unified probabilistic embedding space. We use InfoNCE loss with
Hellinger distance to integrate inter-modality distributions. We introduce a
probabilistic synthetic sampling loss that captures modality-specific mean and
variance to improve intra-modality binding. Extensive experiments across 13
medical datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms current Med-VLPMs in
cross-modality retrieval, zero-shot, and few-shot classification. We also
demonstrate the robust integration of multiple modalities for prognostication,
showing improved intra- and inter-medical modality binding.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MISP-DPO是一个多模态偏好优化框架，通过引入多个语义多样的负样本和Plackett-Luce模型，解决了现有方法依赖简单成对比较的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖过度简化的成对比较，通过基本扰动或基于相似性的检索生成单个负图像，无法捕捉多模态偏好的复杂性，导致优化偏差和幻觉问题。

Method: 在CLIP空间中嵌入提示和候选图像，应用稀疏自编码器揭示可解释的语义偏差因子。基于重建难度、与正样本的语义偏差和相互多样性选择负样本。采用Plackett-Luce目标函数和重要性采样策略。

Result: 在五个不同基准测试上的实验表明，MISP-DPO在多模态对齐方面持续优于先前方法。

Conclusion: 验证了语义感知的多负采样在基于偏好的学习中的有效性。

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has recently been extended from
text-only models to vision-language models. However, existing methods rely on
oversimplified pairwise comparisons, generating a single negative image via
basic perturbations or similarity-based retrieval, which fail to capture the
complex nature of multimodal preferences, inducing optimization bias and
hallucinations. To address this issue, we propose MISP-DPO, the first framework
to incorporate multiple, semantically diverse negative images in multimodal DPO
via the Plackett-Luce model. Our method embeds prompts and candidate images in
CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining) space and applies a sparse
autoencoder to uncover semantic deviations into interpretable factors. Negative
samples are selected based on reconstruction difficulty, semantic deviation
from the positive, and mutual diversity, yielding broader and more informative
supervision. To handle multi-negative comparisons, we adopt a Plackett-Luce
objective and introduce an importance sampling strategy that improves training
efficiency. Experiments across five diverse benchmarks demonstrate that
MISP-DPO consistently improves multimodal alignment over prior methods,
validating the effectiveness of semantic-aware, multi-negative sampling in
preference-based learning.

TL;DR: SAGE提出了一种统一的训练管道，通过联合改进局部特征聚合、训练样本组织和困难样本挖掘，增强细粒度空间-视觉判别能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要关注描述符微调或固定采样策略，但忽略了训练过程中空间上下文和视觉相似性之间的动态交互作用。

Method: 引入轻量级Soft Probing模块学习补丁描述符的残差权重；构建在线地理-视觉图融合地理邻近度和当前视觉相似性；使用贪婪加权团扩展采样器聚焦最有信息量的地点邻域。

Result: 在八个基准测试中达到SOTA，在SPED、Pitts30k-test、MSLS-val和Nordland上分别获得98.9%、95.8%、94.5%和96.0%的Recall@1。

Conclusion: SAGE通过动态融合空间和视觉信息，在视觉地点识别任务中取得了显著性能提升。

Abstract: Visual Place Recognition (VPR) requires robust retrieval of geotagged images
despite large appearance, viewpoint, and environmental variation. Prior methods
focus on descriptor fine-tuning or fixed sampling strategies yet neglect the
dynamic interplay between spatial context and visual similarity during
training. We present SAGE (Spatial-visual Adaptive Graph Exploration), a
unified training pipeline that enhances granular spatial-visual discrimination
by jointly improving local feature aggregation, organize samples during
training, and hard sample mining. We introduce a lightweight Soft Probing
module that learns residual weights from training data for patch descriptors
before bilinear aggregation, boosting distinctive local cues. During training
we reconstruct an online geo-visual graph that fuses geographic proximity and
current visual similarity so that candidate neighborhoods reflect the evolving
embedding landscape. To concentrate learning on the most informative place
neighborhoods, we seed clusters from high-affinity anchors and iteratively
expand them with a greedy weighted clique expansion sampler. Implemented with a
frozen DINOv2 backbone and parameter-efficient fine-tuning, SAGE achieves SOTA
across eight benchmarks. It attains 98.9%, 95.8%, 94.5%, and 96.0% Recall@1 on
SPED, Pitts30k-test, MSLS-val, and Nordland, respectively. Notably, our method
obtains 100% Recall@10 on SPED only using 4096D global descriptors. Code and
model will be available at: https://github.com/chenshunpeng/SAGE.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LaTo是一个基于地标标记化的扩散变换器，用于细粒度、身份保持的人脸编辑，通过量化地标坐标、位置映射编码和基于VLM的地标预测器，解决了现有方法在精确属性控制和身份保持方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于指令的人脸编辑模型在精确属性控制和身份保持方面存在困难，传统方法将地标作为刚性几何约束，在条件地标与源图像显著偏离时会降低身份保持效果。

Method: 提出LaTo框架：1) 地标标记器将原始地标坐标量化为离散面部标记；2) 位置映射位置编码整合面部和图像标记；3) 利用视觉语言模型从指令和源图像推断目标地标。

Result: 在身份保持方面比现有最优方法提升7.8%，在语义一致性方面提升4.6%。构建了HFL-150K数据集，包含15万对真实人脸和细粒度指令。

Conclusion: LaTo通过地标标记化和灵活的解耦几何-外观交互，实现了细粒度、身份保持的人脸编辑，在多个指标上优于现有方法。

Abstract: Recent multimodal models for instruction-based face editing enable semantic
manipulation but still struggle with precise attribute control and identity
preservation. Structural facial representations such as landmarks are effective
for intermediate supervision, yet most existing methods treat them as rigid
geometric constraints, which can degrade identity when conditional landmarks
deviate significantly from the source (e.g., large expression or pose changes,
inaccurate landmark estimates). To address these limitations, we propose LaTo,
a landmark-tokenized diffusion transformer for fine-grained,
identity-preserving face editing. Our key innovations include: (1) a landmark
tokenizer that directly quantizes raw landmark coordinates into discrete facial
tokens, obviating the need for dense pixel-wise correspondence; (2) a
location-mapping positional encoding that integrates facial and image tokens
for unified processing, enabling flexible yet decoupled geometry-appearance
interactions with high efficiency and strong identity preservation; and (3) a
landmark predictor that leverages vision-language models to infer target
landmarks from instructions and source images, whose structured
chain-of-thought improves estimation accuracy and interactive control. To
mitigate data scarcity, we curate HFL-150K, to our knowledge the largest
benchmark for this task, containing over 150K real face pairs with fine-grained
instructions. Extensive experiments show that LaTo outperforms state-of-the-art
methods by 7.8% in identity preservation and 4.6% in semantic consistency. Code
and dataset will be made publicly available upon acceptance.

Result: 在MOSEv1挑战赛测试集上获得86.37%的J&F分数，排名第一

Conclusion: 该方法能有效应对复杂场景下的视频目标分割挑战

Abstract: Video Object Segmentation (VOS) aims to track and segment specific objects
across entire video sequences, yet it remains highly challenging under complex
real-world scenarios. The MOSEv1 and LVOS dataset, adopted in the MOSEv1
challenge on LSVOS 2025, which is specifically designed to enhance the
robustness of VOS models in complex real-world scenarios, including long-term
object disappearances and reappearances, as well as the presence of small and
inconspicuous objects. In this paper, we present our improved method,
Confidence-Guided Fusion Segmentation (CGFSeg), for the VOS task in the MOSEv1
Challenge. During training, the feature extractor of SAM2 is frozen, while the
remaining components are fine-tuned to preserve strong feature extraction
ability and improve segmentation accuracy. In the inference stage, we introduce
a pixel-check strategy that progressively refines predictions by exploiting
complementary strengths of multiple models, thereby yielding robust final
masks. As a result, our method achieves a J&F score of 86.37% on the test set,
ranking 1st in the MOSEv1 Challenge at LSVOS 2025. These results highlight the
effectiveness of our approach in addressing the challenges of VOS task in
complex scenarios.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于SO(3)扩散模型的概率性人体网格恢复方法，通过条件丢弃技术生成与2D观测对齐的3D姿态分布，解决了传统方法在准确性和多样性之间的权衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从单张RGB图像恢复3D人体网格存在固有的模糊性，现有方法要么回归单一确定性输出，要么在准确性和样本多样性之间存在权衡。需要一种能够建模与2D观测对齐的准确姿态概率分布的方法。

Method: 使用SO(3)扩散模型生成以3D旋转表示的姿态参数分布，通过条件丢弃技术实现无条件和图像条件生成。采用时间无关的transformer提取关节的潜在向量，小型MLP去噪模型学习基于潜在向量的每个关节分布。

Result: 实验证明该方法能够有效预测准确的姿态概率分布，解决了准确性和多样性之间的权衡问题。

Conclusion: 提出的SO(3)扩散模型框架能够有效建模与2D观测对齐的人体姿态分布，在保持准确性的同时提供多样化的合理输出。

Abstract: We tackle the problem of Human Mesh Recovery (HMR) from a single RGB image,
formulating it as an image-conditioned human pose and shape generation. While
recovering 3D human pose from 2D observations is inherently ambiguous, most
existing approaches have regressed a single deterministic output. Probabilistic
methods attempt to address this by generating multiple plausible outputs to
model the ambiguity. However, these methods often exhibit a trade-off between
accuracy and sample diversity, and their single predictions are not competitive
with state-of-the-art deterministic models. To overcome these limitations, we
propose a novel approach that models well-aligned distribution to 2D
observations. In particular, we introduce $SO(3)$ diffusion model, which
generates the distribution of pose parameters represented as 3D rotations
unconditional and conditional to image observations via conditioning dropout.
Our model learns the hierarchical structure of human body joints using the
transformer. Instead of using transformer as a denoising model, the
time-independent transformer extracts latent vectors for the joints and a small
MLP-based denoising model learns the per-joint distribution conditioned on the
latent vector. We experimentally demonstrate and analyze that our model
predicts accurate pose probability distribution effectively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于拖拽的图像编辑方法主要在2D像素平面上操作，缺乏3D几何线索，导致在旋转和透视变换等几何密集型场景中产生不精确和不一致的编辑结果。

Method: 提出统一的位移场，联合编码3D几何和2D空间先验；采用无冲突分区策略隔离编辑区域，防止干扰并确保一致性。

Result: 在各种编辑场景下的广泛实验验证了方法的有效性，显示出优越的精度、结构一致性和可靠的多点编辑能力。

Conclusion: GeoDrag能够实现连贯、高保真且结构一致的编辑，在单次前向传播中完成，代码将在GitHub上开源。

Abstract: Interactive point-based image editing serves as a controllable editor,
enabling precise and flexible manipulation of image content. However, most
drag-based methods operate primarily on the 2D pixel plane with limited use of
3D cues. As a result, they often produce imprecise and inconsistent edits,
particularly in geometry-intensive scenarios such as rotations and perspective
transformations. To address these limitations, we propose a novel
geometry-guided drag-based image editing method - GeoDrag, which addresses
three key challenges: 1) incorporating 3D geometric cues into pixel-level
editing, 2) mitigating discontinuities caused by geometry-only guidance, and 3)
resolving conflicts arising from multi-point dragging. Built upon a unified
displacement field that jointly encodes 3D geometry and 2D spatial priors,
GeoDrag enables coherent, high-fidelity, and structure-consistent editing in a
single forward pass. In addition, a conflict-free partitioning strategy is
introduced to isolate editing regions, effectively preventing interference and
ensuring consistency. Extensive experiments across various editing scenarios
validate the effectiveness of our method, showing superior precision,
structural consistency, and reliable multi-point editability. The code will be
available on https://github.com/xinyu-pu/GeoDrag .

TL;DR: IPDRecon是一个基于图像平面解码的室内场景重建框架，通过利用单视图内的空间信息而非多视图几何约束，显著提升了在视图数量减少情况下的重建稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于体素的室内场景重建方法依赖多视图像素反投影射线交点作为几何约束，导致重建质量严重依赖输入视图密度，在重叠区域和未观测区域表现不佳。

Method: 提出IPDRecon框架，包含三个核心组件：像素级置信度编码器(PCE)、仿射补偿模块(ACM)和图像平面空间解码器(IPSD)，通过物理成像过程解码2D图像中编码的3D结构信息。

Result: 在ScanNetV2上的实验表明，IPDRecon在视图数量减少40%时仍能保持几乎相同的重建质量，变异系数仅为0.24%，性能保持率达99.7%，最大性能下降仅0.42%。

Conclusion: 利用视图内空间信息为实际应用中的视图受限场景提供了鲁棒的解决方案，显著提升了重建稳定性。

Abstract: Volume-based indoor scene reconstruction methods demonstrate significant
research value due to their superior generalization capability and real-time
deployment potential. However, existing methods rely on multi-view pixel
back-projection ray intersections as weak geometric constraints to determine
spatial positions, causing reconstruction quality to depend heavily on input
view density with poor performance in overlapping regions and unobserved areas.
To address these issues, the key lies in reducing dependency on inter-view
geometric constraints while exploiting rich spatial information within
individual views. We propose IPDRecon, an image-plane decoding framework
comprising three core components: Pixel-level Confidence Encoder (PCE), Affine
Compensation Module (ACM), and Image-Plane Spatial Decoder (IPSD). These
modules collaboratively decode 3D structural information encoded in 2D images
through physical imaging processes, effectively preserving spatial geometric
features including edges, hollow structures, and complex textures while
significantly enhancing view-invariant reconstruction. Experiments on ScanNetV2
confirm that IPDRecon achieves superior reconstruction stability, maintaining
nearly identical quality when view count reduces by 40%. The method achieves a
coefficient of variation of only 0.24%, performance retention rate of 99.7%,
and maximum performance drop of merely 0.42%. This demonstrates that exploiting
intra-view spatial information provides a robust solution for view-limited
scenarios in practical applications.

Abstract: Ultrasound is crucial in modern medicine but faces challenges like operator
dependence, image noise, and real-time scanning, hindering AI integration.
While large multimodal models excel in other medical imaging areas, they
struggle with ultrasound's complexities. To address this, we introduce Dolphin
v1.0 (V1) and its reasoning-augmented version, Dolphin R1-the first large-scale
multimodal ultrasound foundation models unifying diverse clinical tasks in a
single vision-language framework.To tackle ultrasound variability and noise, we
curated a 2-million-scale multimodal dataset, combining textbook knowledge,
public data, synthetic samples, and general corpora. This ensures robust
perception, generalization, and clinical adaptability.The Dolphin series
employs a three-stage training strategy: domain-specialized pretraining,
instruction-driven alignment, and reinforcement-based refinement. Dolphin v1.0
delivers reliable performance in classification, detection, regression, and
report generation. Dolphin R1 enhances diagnostic inference, reasoning
transparency, and interpretability through reinforcement learning with
ultrasound-specific rewards.Evaluated on U2-Bench across eight ultrasound
tasks, Dolphin R1 achieves a U2-score of 0.5835-over twice the second-best
model (0.2968) setting a new state of the art. Dolphin v1.0 also performs
competitively, validating the unified framework. Comparisons show
reasoning-enhanced training significantly improves diagnostic accuracy,
consistency, and interpretability, highlighting its importance for high-stakes
medical AI.

*Junseo Park,Hyeryung Jang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ART-VITON是一个基于测量引导扩散的虚拟试穿框架，通过线性逆问题重构和轨迹对齐求解器，有效保留非试穿区域的身份和背景信息，消除边界伪影，提升视觉保真度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有虚拟试穿方法在保留非试穿区域时存在边界伪影问题，直接替换策略会导致突兀的过渡。需要一种能渐进式保持测量一致性的方法来解决这个问题。

Method: 将虚拟试穿重构为线性逆问题，采用轨迹对齐求解器；集成基于残差先验的初始化来缓解训练-推理不匹配；提出无伪影的测量引导采样，结合数据一致性、频率级校正和周期性标准去噪。

Result: 在VITON-HD、DressCode和SHHQ-1.0数据集上的实验表明，ART-VITON能有效保留身份和背景，消除边界伪影，在视觉保真度和鲁棒性方面持续优于最先进的基线方法。

Conclusion: ART-VITON通过测量引导的扩散框架成功解决了虚拟试穿中的边界伪影问题，为高质量虚拟试穿提供了一种有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Virtual try-on (VITON) aims to generate realistic images of a person wearing
a target garment, requiring precise garment alignment in try-on regions and
faithful preservation of identity and background in non-try-on regions. While
latent diffusion models (LDMs) have advanced alignment and detail synthesis,
preserving non-try-on regions remains challenging. A common post-hoc strategy
directly replaces these regions with original content, but abrupt transitions
often produce boundary artifacts. To overcome this, we reformulate VITON as a
linear inverse problem and adopt trajectory-aligned solvers that progressively
enforce measurement consistency, reducing abrupt changes in non-try-on regions.
However, existing solvers still suffer from semantic drift during generation,
leading to artifacts. We propose ART-VITON, a measurement-guided diffusion
framework that ensures measurement adherence while maintaining artifact-free
synthesis. Our method integrates residual prior-based initialization to
mitigate training-inference mismatch and artifact-free measurement-guided
sampling that combines data consistency, frequency-level correction, and
periodic standard denoising. Experiments on VITON-HD, DressCode, and SHHQ-1.0
demonstrate that ART-VITON effectively preserves identity and background,
eliminates boundary artifacts, and consistently improves visual fidelity and
robustness over state-of-the-art baselines.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出Text Preference Optimization (TPO)框架，通过训练模型偏好匹配提示而非不匹配提示，实现无需配对图像偏好数据的文本到图像模型对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于人类反馈的强化学习方法依赖昂贵的配对图像偏好数据或学习奖励函数，面临可扩展性限制。

Method: 使用大语言模型扰动原始标题构建不匹配提示，训练模型偏好匹配提示，扩展DPO和KTO算法为TDPO和TKTO。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，该方法在人类偏好评分和文本-图像对齐方面持续优于原始方法。

Conclusion: TPO框架实现了'免费午餐'对齐，无需配对图像偏好数据，具有通用性和兼容性。

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion-based text-to-image (T2I) models have led to
remarkable success in generating high-quality images from textual prompts.
However, ensuring accurate alignment between the text and the generated image
remains a significant challenge for state-of-the-art diffusion models. To
address this, existing studies employ reinforcement learning with human
feedback (RLHF) to align T2I outputs with human preferences. These methods,
however, either rely directly on paired image preference data or require a
learned reward function, both of which depend heavily on costly, high-quality
human annotations and thus face scalability limitations. In this work, we
introduce Text Preference Optimization (TPO), a framework that enables
"free-lunch" alignment of T2I models, achieving alignment without the need for
paired image preference data. TPO works by training the model to prefer matched
prompts over mismatched prompts, which are constructed by perturbing original
captions using a large language model. Our framework is general and compatible
with existing preference-based algorithms. We extend both DPO and KTO to our
setting, resulting in TDPO and TKTO. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations
across multiple benchmarks show that our methods consistently outperform their
original counterparts, delivering better human preference scores and improved
text-to-image alignment. Our Open-source code is available at
https://github.com/DSL-Lab/T2I-Free-Lunch-Alignment.

TL;DR: 提出了v-HUB视觉幽默理解基准，评估多模态大语言模型仅通过视觉线索理解幽默的能力，发现模型表现不佳，且音频有助于提升幽默理解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估和诊断多模态大语言模型理解幽默的能力，特别是仅通过视觉线索理解幽默的能力，这对于提升人机交互的参与度具有重要意义。

Method: 构建v-HUB基准，包含来自经典默片和在线资源的非语言短视频，每个视频配有丰富注释（字幕、描述、解释），支持字幕匹配和幽默解释等评估任务，并构建开放式视频问答任务。

Result: 实验结果显示，所有模型在仅基于视觉线索的幽默理解上都表现困难，从文本评估转向视频评估时性能显著下降。音频的加入有助于视频幽默理解。

Conclusion: 多模态大语言模型在仅通过视觉线索理解幽默方面存在困难，音频信息有助于提升理解能力，表明整合更丰富的模态对于复杂视频理解任务具有前景。

Abstract: AI models capable of comprehending humor hold real-world promise -- for
example, enhancing engagement in human-machine interactions. To gauge and
diagnose the capacity of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for humor
understanding, we introduce v-HUB, a novel visual-centric video humor
understanding benchmark. v-HUB comprises a curated collection of minimally
verbal short videos, sourced from classic silent films and online resources,
and reflecting real-world scenarios where humor can be appreciated purely
through visual cues. Each video clip is paired with rich annotations, including
captions, descriptions, and explanations, supporting evaluation tasks like
caption matching and humor explanation. To broaden its applicability, we
further construct an open-ended video QA task, making it readily integrable
into existing video understanding benchmarks. We evaluate a diverse set of
MLLMs, from specialized Video-LLMs to versatile OmniLLMs that can process
audio, covering both open-source and proprietary domains. The experimental
results expose the difficulties MLLMs face in comprehending humor from visual
cues alone. For example, all models exhibit a marked performance drop on
caption matching when moving from text-based to video-based evaluation (without
audio). Our findings also demonstrate that incorporating audio helps with video
humor understanding, highlighting the informativeness of sound and the promise
of integrating richer modalities for complex video understanding tasks.

*Jeongjae Lee,Jong Chul Ye*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了PCPO框架来解决文本到图像模型强化学习训练中的不稳定性和高方差问题，通过比例信用分配实现更稳定的训练过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的策略梯度方法在文本到图像模型对齐中存在训练不稳定和高方差问题，这阻碍了收敛速度并损害了图像质量。分析发现主要原因是生成采样器的数学结构导致跨时间步的反馈不稳定且不成比例。

Method: 提出了比例信用策略优化(PCPO)框架，通过稳定的目标重构和原则性的时间步重加权来强制执行比例信用分配。

Result: PCPO显著稳定了训练过程，加速了收敛并提升了图像质量，通过减轻模型崩溃这一常见故障模式实现了质量改进。

Conclusion: PCPO在所有方面都显著优于现有的策略梯度基线方法，包括最先进的DanceGRPO。

Abstract: While reinforcement learning has advanced the alignment of text-to-image
(T2I) models, state-of-the-art policy gradient methods are still hampered by
training instability and high variance, hindering convergence speed and
compromising image quality. Our analysis identifies a key cause of this
instability: disproportionate credit assignment, in which the mathematical
structure of the generative sampler produces volatile and non-proportional
feedback across timesteps. To address this, we introduce Proportionate Credit
Policy Optimization (PCPO), a framework that enforces proportional credit
assignment through a stable objective reformulation and a principled
reweighting of timesteps. This correction stabilizes the training process,
leading to significantly accelerated convergence and superior image quality.
The improvement in quality is a direct result of mitigating model collapse, a
common failure mode in recursive training. PCPO substantially outperforms
existing policy gradient baselines on all fronts, including the
state-of-the-art DanceGRPO.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为ENM Inversion的新反演技术，通过搜索最优噪声图来同时保证内容保持和可编辑性，解决了现有方法在文本引导图像编辑中难以紧密遵循目标提示的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散模型在文本引导图像编辑中面临挑战：虽然反演噪声图能忠实重建源图像，但限制了进行所需编辑的灵活性，导致难以紧密遵循目标文本提示。

Method: 分析增强可编辑性的噪声图特性，引入可编辑噪声精炼，通过最小化重建和编辑噪声图之间的差异来与期望编辑对齐。

Result: 大量实验表明，ENM Inversion在广泛的图像编辑任务中，在内容保持和编辑保真度方面均优于现有方法，并能轻松应用于视频编辑以实现时间一致性和跨帧内容操作。

Conclusion: ENM Inversion是一种有效的反演技术，能够同时实现高质量的内容保持和编辑保真度，为文本引导的图像和视频编辑提供了更好的解决方案。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in generating
high-quality and diverse images. Building on these advancements, diffusion
models have also demonstrated exceptional performance in text-guided image
editing. A key strategy for effective image editing involves inverting the
source image into editable noise maps associated with the target image.
However, previous inversion methods face challenges in adhering closely to the
target text prompt. The limitation arises because inverted noise maps, while
enabling faithful reconstruction of the source image, restrict the flexibility
needed for desired edits. To overcome this issue, we propose Editable Noise Map
Inversion (ENM Inversion), a novel inversion technique that searches for
optimal noise maps to ensure both content preservation and editability. We
analyze the properties of noise maps for enhanced editability. Based on this
analysis, our method introduces an editable noise refinement that aligns with
the desired edits by minimizing the difference between the reconstructed and
edited noise maps. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ENM Inversion
outperforms existing approaches across a wide range of image editing tasks in
both preservation and edit fidelity with target prompts. Our approach can also
be easily applied to video editing, enabling temporal consistency and content
manipulation across frames.

TL;DR: EvoQuality是一个无需人工标注的自监督框架，通过自我一致性原则和群体相对策略优化，让视觉语言模型自主提升图像质量评估能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉语言模型后训练方法依赖昂贵的人工标注数据，而自监督方法在感知领域如图像质量评估中的应用尚未充分探索。

Method: 采用基于排名的自我一致性方法，通过多数投票生成伪标签，构建保真度奖励，使用群体相对策略优化进行迭代优化。

Result: 在多个IQA基准测试中，零样本性能提升31.8%，在7个基准中的5个上超过最先进的监督方法。

Conclusion: EvoQuality证明了完全自监督方法在图像质量评估任务中的有效性，能够达到甚至超过监督方法的性能。

Abstract: Improving vision-language models (VLMs) in the post-training stage typically
relies on supervised fine-tuning or reinforcement learning, methods that
necessitate costly, human-annotated data. While self-supervised techniques such
as self-consistency have proven effective for enhancing reasoning capabilities,
their application to perceptual domains such as image quality assessment (IQA)
remains largely unexplored. In this work, we introduce EvoQuality, a novel
framework that enables a VLM to autonomously refine its quality perception
capabilities without any ground-truth labels. EvoQuality adapts the principle
of self-consistency to the ranking-based nature of IQA. It generates
pseudo-labels by performing pairwise majority voting on the VLM's own outputs
to establish a consensus on relative quality. These pseudo-rankings are then
formulated into a fidelity reward that guides the model's iterative evolution
through group relative policy optimization (GRPO). By iteratively leveraging
its own predictions, EvoQuality progressively refines the VLM's perceptual
capability. Extensive experiments show that EvoQuality boosts the base VLM's
zero-shot performance by 31.8\% on PLCC across diverse IQA benchmarks.
Remarkably, despite being entirely self-supervised, EvoQuality achieves
performance that is competitive with, or even surpasses, state-of-the-art
supervised VLM-based IQA models, outperforming these models on 5 out of 7 IQA
benchmarks.

TL;DR: EchoingECG是一个概率性师生模型，利用不确定性感知的ECG嵌入和ECHO监督来改进基于ECG的心脏功能预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 心电图(ECG)成本低且易获取，而超声心动图(ECHO)需要更多医院资源但临床价值高。研究旨在利用ECG预测传统上需要ECHO才能获得的心脏功能指标。

Method: 结合概率跨模态嵌入(PCME++)和ECHO-CLIP视觉语言预训练模型，将ECHO知识蒸馏到ECG表示中，构建概率对比框架。

Result: 在零样本、少样本和微调设置下，EchoingECG在基于ECG的ECHO预测方面优于最先进的ECG基础模型。方差估计增强了模型性能理解。

Conclusion: 该方法成功将ECHO知识蒸馏到ECG表示中，提高了ECG预测心脏功能的准确性，并通过不确定性估计提供了更好的性能理解。

Abstract: Electrocardiogram (ECG) is a widely used tool for assessing cardiac function
due to its low cost and accessibility. Emergent research shows that ECGs can
help make predictions on key outcomes traditionally derived from more complex
modalities such as echocardiograms (ECHO), enabling the use of ECGs as a more
accessible method to predict broader measurements of cardiac function. ECHO, in
particular, are of great importance because they require considerable hospital
resources while playing a key role in clinical cardiac assessment. To aid this
use case, we introduce EchoingECG, a probabilistic student-teacher model that
leverages uncertainty-aware ECG embeddings and ECHO supervision to improve
ECG-based cardiac function prediction. Our approach integrates Probabilistic
Cross-Modal Embeddings (PCME++), a probabilistic contrastive framework, with
ECHO-CLIP, a vision-language pre-trained model trained on ECHO-text pairs, to
distill ECHO knowledge into ECG representations. Through experiments and
external validation, we showed that EchoingECG outperforms state-of-the-art
foundation ECG models in zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tune settings for ECHO
predictions based on ECG. We also highlighted that variance estimation (enabled
through our method) enhanced our understanding of model performance by
identifying underlying regions of uncertainty within ECGs. The code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准主要通过基于图像标注的多选题评估VLMs的具身推理能力，缺乏对精确视觉定位能力的系统评估。

Method: 设计了包含三个阶段的层次评估协议：S1参考对象定位、S2任务驱动指向、S3视觉轨迹预测，数据来自室内、厨房、驾驶和机器人操作等关键领域。

Result: 对10多个最先进VLM的实验发现，GPT-4o等通用模型在精确视觉定位上表现不如某些开源模型；MoLMO在S1和S2表现良好但在需要视觉轨迹规划的S3中表现不佳。

Conclusion: PIO基准揭示了VLMs在具身推理中精确视觉定位能力的局限性，为未来模型开发提供了重要参考。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated impressive world knowledge
across a wide range of tasks, making them promising candidates for embodied
reasoning applications. However, existing benchmarks primarily evaluate the
embodied reasoning ability of VLMs through multiple-choice questions based on
image annotations -- for example, selecting which trajectory better describes
an event in the image. In this work, we introduce the Point-It-Out (PIO)
benchmark, a novel benchmark designed to systematically assess the embodied
reasoning abilities of VLMs through precise visual grounding. We propose a
hierarchical evaluation protocol spanning three stages (S1: referred-object
localization, S2: task-driven pointing, and S3: visual trace prediction), with
data collected from critical domains for embodied intelligence, including
indoor, kitchen, driving, and robotic manipulation scenarios. Extensive
experiments with over ten state-of-the-art VLMs reveal several interesting
findings. For example, strong general-purpose models such as GPT-4o, while
excelling on many benchmarks (e.g., language, perception, and reasoning),
underperform compared to some open-source models in precise visual grounding;
models such as MoLMO perform well in S1 and S2 but struggle in S3, where
requires grounding combined with visual trace planning.

TL;DR: 提出DSGA模块结合LoRA，在极少量数据下优化SAM模型，用于农业图像中密集小物体的精确分割，显著提升性能并保持参数效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 农业计算机视觉任务中，基础模型的参数高效微调面临训练数据有限和复杂田间条件的挑战，需要解决小密集物体的精确分割问题。

Method: 引入动态相似性图适应(DSGA)模块，通过可学习多项式衰减初始化权重排序机制构建动态相似性图，结合自适应局部特征聚合，并与LoRA集成形成互补优化框架。

Result: 在鹰嘴豆荚数据集上，DSGA+LoRA在2、4、8、10样本设置下均表现优异，相比基线SAM微调，结构度量提升17.31%，自适应F度量提升62.36%，参数仅需4.00M（原SAM的4.26%）。

Conclusion: 该方法在复杂田间条件下实现了准确的豆荚计数（调整R方0.8987），验证了其在自动化农业监测应用中的实用价值。

Abstract: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) of foundation models for agricultural
computer vision tasks remains challenging due to limited training data and
complex field conditions. This study introduces a Dynamic Similarity-based
Graph Adaptation (DSGA) module to adapt the Segment Anything Model (SAM) under
extreme data constraints for precise foreground and instance segmentation of
small dense objects in complex agricultural environments. Through dynamic
similarity graph construction with a learnable polynomial decay-initialized
weight ranking mechanism and adaptive local feature aggregation, DSGA
establishes robust spatial and dynamic similarity representation with only
4.00M trainable parameters, which is 4.26% of the original SAM. Integrating
this graph-based feature adaptation with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) creates a
complementary optimization framework that effectively captures both local and
global dependencies in image embeddings while preserving model stability and
parameter efficiency. Experimental results on a challenging chickpea pod
dataset demonstrated that DSGA with LoRA achieved superior performance across
multiple metrics evaluated under 2, 4, 8 and 10 shots, with progressive
performance gains as shot count increased. Quantitative metrics showed a 17.31%
improvement in Structure-measure and a 62.36% gain in adaptive F-measure
compared to the baseline SAM fine-tuning. Comprehensive ablation studies and
visualization analyses through Grad-CAM and t-SNE validated the framework's
effectiveness in feature discrimination. The proposed adaptation demonstrated
practical utility for automated agricultural monitoring applications, achieving
accurate pod-counting with an adjusted R-squared of 0.8987 for images with 10
to 120 pods under challenging field conditions.

Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型在领域特定场景（如产品审核）中的应用研究不足，传统logo识别方法依赖记忆大量品牌表示，在现实场景中不实用。

Result: Logo-VGR在OOD设置下比强基线方法高出近10个点，显示出优越的泛化性能。

Conclusion: 该方法能够仅通过少量品牌监督实现大规模品牌识别，解决了现有模型过拟合和泛化能力差的问题。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have been
primarily evaluated on general-purpose benchmarks, while their applications in
domain-specific scenarios, such as intelligent product moderation, remain
underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce an open-world logo recognition
benchmark, a core challenge in product moderation. Unlike traditional logo
recognition methods that rely on memorizing representations of tens of
thousands of brands-an impractical approach in real-world settings-our proposed
method, Logo-VGR, enables generalization to large-scale brand recognition with
supervision from only a small subset of brands. Specifically, we reformulate
logo recognition as a comparison-based task, requiring the model to match
product images with candidate logos rather than directly generating brand
labels. We further observe that existing models tend to overfit by memorizing
brand distributions instead of learning robust multimodal reasoning, which
results in poor performance on unseen brands. To overcome this limitation,
Logo-VGR introduces a new paradigm of domain-specific multimodal reasoning:
Logo Perception Grounding injects domain knowledge, and Logo-Guided Visual
Grounded Reasoning enhances the model's reasoning capability. Experimental
results show that Logo-VGR outperforms strong baselines by nearly 10 points in
OOD settings, demonstrating superior generalization.

Abstract: Understanding the spatio-temporal distribution of species is a cornerstone of
ecology and conservation. By pairing species observations with geographic and
environmental predictors, researchers can model the relationship between an
environment and the species which may be found there. To advance the
state-of-the-art in this area with deep learning models and remote sensing
data, we organized an open machine learning challenge called GeoLifeCLEF 2023.
The training dataset comprised 5 million plant species observations (single
positive label per sample) distributed across Europe and covering most of its
flora, high-resolution rasters: remote sensing imagery, land cover, elevation,
in addition to coarse-resolution data: climate, soil and human footprint

to predict the species composition in 22 thousand small plots based on
standardized surveys. This paper presents an overview of the competition,
synthesizes the approaches used by the participating teams, and analyzes the

fitted to single positive labels when it comes to the multi-label evaluation,
and the new and effective learning strategy combining single and multi-label

*Kazuki Matsuda,Yuiga Wada,Shinnosuke Hirano,Seitaro Otsuki,Komei Sugiura*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VELA是一个用于评估多模态大语言模型生成长图像描述的自动评估指标，在专门的长描述基准LongCap-Arena上实现了超越人类的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的图像描述评估指标主要针对短描述设计，不适用于长描述评估；同时基于LLM的评估方法存在推理速度慢的问题。

Method: 提出VELA评估指标，采用LLM-Hybrid-as-a-Judge框架；构建LongCap-Arena基准，包含7,805张图像、对应的人类长参考描述和候选描述，以及32,246个人类判断。

Result: VELA在LongCap-Arena基准上超越了现有所有评估指标，并实现了超越人类的表现。

Conclusion: VELA是评估长图像描述的有效自动评估指标，在专门设计的基准上表现出色。

Abstract: In this study, we focus on the automatic evaluation of long and detailed
image captions generated by multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Most
existing automatic evaluation metrics for image captioning are primarily
designed for short captions and are not suitable for evaluating long captions.
Moreover, recent LLM-as-a-Judge approaches suffer from slow inference due to
their reliance on autoregressive inference and early fusion of visual
information. To address these limitations, we propose VELA, an automatic
evaluation metric for long captions developed within a novel
LLM-Hybrid-as-a-Judge framework. Furthermore, we propose LongCap-Arena, a
benchmark specifically designed for evaluating metrics for long captions. This
benchmark comprises 7,805 images, the corresponding human-provided long
reference captions and long candidate captions, and 32,246 human judgments from
three distinct perspectives: Descriptiveness, Relevance, and Fluency. We
demonstrated that VELA outperformed existing metrics and achieved superhuman
performance on LongCap-Arena.

### [53] [Training-Free Reward-Guided Image Editing via Trajectory Optimal Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25845)
*Jinho Chang,Jaemin Kim,Jong Chul Ye*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需训练、基于奖励引导的图像编辑框架，将编辑过程建模为轨迹最优控制问题，在扩散模型的反向过程中通过伴随状态迭代更新来引导编辑过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的奖励引导方法主要关注图像生成，而图像编辑任务需要在保持源图像语义内容的同时增强目标奖励，这方面的研究还很缺乏。

Method: 将图像编辑过程表述为轨迹最优控制问题，将扩散模型的反向过程视为从源图像出发的可控轨迹，通过迭代更新伴随状态来引导编辑过程。

Result: 在多种不同编辑任务上的实验表明，该方法显著优于现有的基于反转的无训练指导基线，在奖励最大化和源图像保真度之间实现了更好的平衡，且没有出现奖励攻击问题。

Conclusion: 该框架为奖励引导的图像编辑提供了一种有效的无需训练解决方案，能够很好地平衡奖励优化和内容保真度。

Abstract: Recent advancements in diffusion and flow-matching models have demonstrated
remarkable capabilities in high-fidelity image synthesis. A prominent line of
research involves reward-guided guidance, which steers the generation process
during inference to align with specific objectives. However, leveraging this
reward-guided approach to the task of image editing, which requires preserving
the semantic content of the source image while enhancing a target reward, is
largely unexplored. In this work, we introduce a novel framework for
training-free, reward-guided image editing. We formulate the editing process as
a trajectory optimal control problem where the reverse process of a diffusion
model is treated as a controllable trajectory originating from the source
image, and the adjoint states are iteratively updated to steer the editing
process. Through extensive experiments across distinct editing tasks, we
demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing
inversion-based training-free guidance baselines, achieving a superior balance
between reward maximization and fidelity to the source image without reward
hacking.

TL;DR: 论文发现多模态推理存在双重性：虽然增强逻辑推理能力，但会损害感知基础，导致视觉遗忘。作者提出VAPO方法来解决这个问题，并在多个基准测试中取得SOTA结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型通过强化学习增强推理能力，但研究发现这种推理过程会逐渐削弱模型对视觉输入的依赖，导致视觉遗忘问题。

Method: 提出Vision-Anchored Policy Optimization (VAPO)方法，通过明确引导推理过程朝向视觉基础轨迹，增强模型对视觉信息的依赖。

Result: VAPO-Thinker-7B模型显著增强了模型对视觉信息的依赖，在多个基准测试中取得了新的最先进结果。

Conclusion: 多模态推理具有双重性，需要平衡推理能力与感知基础。VAPO方法有效解决了视觉遗忘问题，为视觉语言模型的进一步发展提供了重要方向。

Abstract: Reasoning has emerged as a pivotal capability in Large Language Models
(LLMs). Through Reinforcement Learning (RL), typically Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO), these models are able to solve complex tasks such as
mathematics and code generation. Building on these advances, recent research
has sought to extend reasoning to Vision-Language Models (VLMs), yielding
promising results across diverse visual tasks. Despite this progress, our study
uncovers the dual nature of multimodal reasoning: while it substantially
enhances logical inference and facilitates performance on challenging problems,
it may gradually impair perceptual grounding, leading to recognition failures
on otherwise basic visual questions. Through further analysis, we attribute
this phenomenon to visual forgetting, wherein prolonged reasoning causes the
model to increasingly disregard visual input. To address this, we propose
Vision-Anchored Policy Optimization (VAPO), a simple yet effective method that
explicitly steers the reasoning process toward visually grounded trajectories.
Our result model, VAPO-Thinker-7B, significantly strengthens the model's
reliance on visual information and achieves new state-of-the-art results on a
wide range of established benchmarks. Project page:

TL;DR: 提出了首个多模态符号逻辑推理基准MuSLR，评估了7个最先进的视觉语言模型，发现它们在该任务上表现不佳，最佳模型GPT-4.1仅达到46.8%。提出了LogiCAM框架提升性能，并分析了70%的错误源于模态间的逻辑不对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态符号逻辑推理在自动驾驶、医疗诊断等高风险应用中至关重要，其严谨的确定性推理有助于防止严重后果。需要评估当前视觉语言模型的这种能力。

Method: 创建了MuSLR基准，包含1,093个实例，涵盖7个领域，包括35个原子符号逻辑和976个逻辑组合，推理深度从2到9。提出了LogiCAM框架，将形式逻辑规则应用于多模态输入。

Result: 评估的7个最先进视觉语言模型在MuSLR上表现不佳，GPT-4.1最佳仅46.8%。LogiCAM将GPT-4.1的Chain-of-Thought性能提升了14.13%，在复杂逻辑如一阶逻辑上提升更大。70%的错误源于模态间逻辑不对齐。

Conclusion: 当前视觉语言模型在多模态符号逻辑推理方面存在显著不足，LogiCAM框架能有效提升性能，模态间逻辑对齐是未来改进的关键方向。

Abstract: Multimodal symbolic logical reasoning, which aims to deduce new facts from
multimodal input via formal logic, is critical in high-stakes applications such
as autonomous driving and medical diagnosis, as its rigorous, deterministic
reasoning helps prevent serious consequences. To evaluate such capabilities of
current state-of-the-art vision language models (VLMs), we introduce the first
benchmark MuSLR for multimodal symbolic logical reasoning grounded in formal
logical rules. MuSLR comprises 1,093 instances across 7 domains, including 35
atomic symbolic logic and 976 logical combinations, with reasoning depths
ranging from 2 to 9. We evaluate 7 state-of-the-art VLMs on MuSLR and find that
they all struggle with multimodal symbolic reasoning, with the best model,
GPT-4.1, achieving only 46.8%. Thus, we propose LogiCAM, a modular framework
that applies formal logical rules to multimodal inputs, boosting GPT-4.1's
Chain-of-Thought performance by 14.13%, and delivering even larger gains on
complex logics such as first-order logic. We also conduct a comprehensive error
analysis, showing that around 70% of failures stem from logical misalignment
between modalities, offering key insights to guide future improvements. All

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业异常检测越来越依赖基础模型，但以往研究主要关注文本提示调优，而视觉对应部分则分散在各个基础模型特定的处理步骤中。本文旨在解决这一局限性。

Method: 提出了PatchEAD框架，构建视觉提示技术，包括对齐模块和前景掩码，实现无需训练的异常检测，兼容多种基础模型。

Result: 实验显示在少样本和批量零样本性能上优于先前工作，尽管没有使用文本特征。研究还分析了骨干网络结构和预训练特性对补丁相似性鲁棒性的影响。

Conclusion: 一个良好统一的仅补丁框架可以实现快速、轻量校准的部署，无需精心设计的文本提示。

Abstract: Industrial anomaly detection is increasingly relying on foundation models,
aiming for strong out-of-distribution generalization and rapid adaptation in
real-world deployments. Notably, past studies have primarily focused on textual
prompt tuning, leaving the intrinsic visual counterpart fragmented into
processing steps specific to each foundation model. We aim to address this
limitation by proposing a unified patch-focused framework, Patch-Exclusive
Anomaly Detection (PatchEAD), enabling training-free anomaly detection that is
compatible with diverse foundation models. The framework constructs visual
prompting techniques, including an alignment module and foreground masking. Our
experiments show superior few-shot and batch zero-shot performance compared to
prior work, despite the absence of textual features. Our study further examines
how backbone structure and pretrained characteristics affect patch-similarity
robustness, providing actionable guidance for selecting and configuring
foundation models for real-world visual inspection. These results confirm that
a well-unified patch-only framework can enable quick, calibration-light
deployment without the need for carefully engineered textual prompts.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种硬件无关的方法，使用多摄像头输入为机械LiDAR生成彩色点云，实现360度覆盖。主要创新在于通过集成低光图像增强模块，在低光照条件下保持鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 融合相机和LiDAR数据以增强空间理解，特别是在低光照条件下保持性能，解决传统方法在恶劣光照条件下的局限性。

Method: 需要初始相机标定，然后自动计算LiDAR与相机间的几何变换。数据处理框架包括色彩校正确保相机间一致性，集成低光图像增强模块。使用Velodyne Puck Hi-Res LiDAR和四摄像头配置进行测试。

Result: 优化后的软件实现了实时性能，在极低光照下仍能可靠地进行色彩化，成功恢复了原本无法检测到的场景细节。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种无需专用标定目标的简化设置流程，在低光照条件下表现出色，为空间感知应用提供了实用的解决方案。

Abstract: In recent years, the fusion of camera data with LiDAR measurements has
emerged as a powerful approach to enhance spatial understanding. This study
introduces a novel, hardware-agnostic methodology that generates colourised
point clouds from mechanical LiDAR using multiple camera inputs, providing
complete 360-degree coverage. The primary innovation lies in its robustness
under low-light conditions, achieved through the integration of a low-light
image enhancement module within the fusion pipeline. The system requires
initial calibration to determine intrinsic camera parameters, followed by
automatic computation of the geometric transformation between the LiDAR and
cameras, removing the need for specialised calibration targets and streamlining
the setup. The data processing framework uses colour correction to ensure
uniformity across camera feeds before fusion. The algorithm was tested using a
Velodyne Puck Hi-Res LiDAR and a four-camera configuration. The optimised
software achieved real-time performance and reliable colourisation even under
very low illumination, successfully recovering scene details that would
otherwise remain undetectable.

TL;DR: MAPLE是一个用于少样本全切片图像分类的分层提示学习框架，通过整合多尺度视觉语义并在实体和切片级别进行预测，解决了现有方法无法捕捉组织学实体亚型特异性表型变异的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常依赖切片级提示，无法捕捉对癌症诊断至关重要的组织学实体（如细胞核、腺体）的亚型特异性表型变异，这限制了模型在病理诊断中的性能。

Method: 1. 使用LLM生成实体级和切片级提示；2. 提出实体引导的交叉注意力模块生成实体级特征；3. 开发跨尺度实体图学习模块丰富实体表示；4. 将精炼表示聚合为切片级表示进行预测；5. 结合实体级和切片级输出得到最终结果。

Conclusion: MAPLE通过整合多尺度视觉语义和分层预测，显著提升了少样本全切片图像分类的性能，为病理诊断提供了更精细的分析能力。

Abstract: Prompt learning has emerged as a promising paradigm for adapting pre-trained
vision-language models (VLMs) to few-shot whole slide image (WSI)
classification by aligning visual features with textual representations,
thereby reducing annotation cost and enhancing model generalization.
Nevertheless, existing methods typically rely on slide-level prompts and fail
to capture the subtype-specific phenotypic variations of histological entities
(\emph{e.g.,} nuclei, glands) that are critical for cancer diagnosis. To
address this gap, we propose Multi-scale Attribute-enhanced Prompt Learning
(\textbf{MAPLE}), a hierarchical framework for few-shot WSI classification that
jointly integrates multi-scale visual semantics and performs prediction at both
the entity and slide levels. Specifically, we first leverage large language
models (LLMs) to generate entity-level prompts that can help identify
multi-scale histological entities and their phenotypic attributes, as well as
slide-level prompts to capture global visual descriptions. Then, an
entity-guided cross-attention module is proposed to generate entity-level
features, followed by aligning with their corresponding subtype-specific
attributes for fine-grained entity-level prediction. To enrich entity
representations, we further develop a cross-scale entity graph learning module
that can update these representations by capturing their semantic correlations
within and across scales. The refined representations are then aggregated into
a slide-level representation and aligned with the corresponding prompts for
slide-level prediction. Finally, we combine both entity-level and slide-level
outputs to produce the final prediction results. Results on three cancer
cohorts confirm the effectiveness of our approach in addressing few-shot
pathology diagnosis tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 推动视觉语言模型从文本主导的思维链转向图像交互式推理的"图像思维"范式，解决现有方法在数据构建准确性、结构设计和应用场景方面的不足。

Method: 构建包含31k条思维链推理轨迹的图像-文本交错数据集，设计直接在视觉嵌入空间生成"视觉思维"的模型，避免调用外部工具和重复重新编码生成图像。

Result: 在多模态推理基准测试中表现出强大性能，验证了数据集的实用性和模型设计的有效性。

Conclusion: DeepSketcher通过工具无关的"图像思维"方法，为多模态推理提供了更灵活和有效的解决方案，推动了视觉语言模型推理能力的发展。

Abstract: The "thinking with images" paradigm represents a pivotal shift in the
reasoning of Vision Language Models (VLMs), moving from text-dominant
chain-of-thought to image-interactive reasoning. By invoking visual tools or
generating intermediate visual representations, VLMs can iteratively attend to
fine-grained regions, enabling deeper image understanding and more faithful
multimodal reasoning. As an emerging paradigm, however, it still leaves
substantial room for exploration in data construction accuracy, structural
design, and broader application scenarios, which offer rich opportunities for
advancing multimodal reasoning. To further advance this line of work, we
present DeepSketcher, a comprehensive suite comprising both an image-text
interleaved dataset and a self-contained model. The dataset contains 31k
chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning trajectories with diverse tool calls and
resulting edited images, covering a wide range of data types and manipulation
instructions with high annotation accuracy. Building on this resource, we
design a model that performs interleaved image-text reasoning and natively
generates "visual thoughts" by operating directly in the visual embedding
space, rather than invoking external tools and repeatedly re-encoding generated
images. This design enables tool-free and more flexible "thinking with images".
Extensive experiments on multimodal reasoning benchmarks demonstrate strong
performance, validating both the utility of the dataset and the effectiveness
of the model design.

Abstract: We introduce mpLLM, a prompt-conditioned hierarchical mixture-of-experts

Abstract: As Vision-Language Models (VLMs) move into interactive, multi-turn use, new
safety risks arise that single-turn or single-modality moderation misses. In
Multimodal Multi-Turn (MMT) dialogues, malicious intent can be spread across
turns and images, while context-sensitive replies may still advance harmful
content. To address this challenge, we present the first systematic definition
and study of MMT dialogue safety. Building on this formulation, we introduce
the Multimodal Multi-turn Dialogue Safety (MMDS) dataset. We further develop an
automated multimodal multi-turn red-teaming framework based on Monte Carlo Tree
Search (MCTS) to generate unsafe multimodal multi-turn dialogues for MMDS. MMDS
contains 4,484 annotated multimodal dialogue samples with fine-grained safety
ratings, policy dimension labels, and evidence-based rationales for both users
and assistants. Leveraging MMDS, we present LLaVAShield, a powerful tool that
jointly detects and assesses risk in user inputs and assistant responses.
Across comprehensive experiments, LLaVAShield consistently outperforms strong
baselines on MMT content moderation tasks and under dynamic policy
configurations, establishing new state-of-the-art results. We will publicly

Motivation: 视觉语言模型擅长高层次场景理解，但在需要精确定位的细粒度感知任务上表现不佳，因为语言中心架构难以生成精确的数值坐标。

Method: 提出VLM-FO1框架，包含混合细粒度区域编码器（HFRE）和基于token的引用系统，采用两阶段训练策略，可作为即插即用模块与任何预训练VLM集成。

Result: 在多个基准测试中达到最先进性能，在目标定位、区域生成理解和视觉区域推理方面表现出色。

Conclusion: VLM-FO1为构建感知感知的视觉语言模型建立了有效且灵活的范式，弥合了高层次推理与细粒度视觉定位之间的差距。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel at high-level scene understanding but
falter on fine-grained perception tasks requiring precise localization. This
failure stems from a fundamental mismatch, as generating exact numerical
coordinates is a challenging task for language-centric architectures. In this
paper, we introduce VLM-FO1, a novel framework that overcomes this limitation
by reframing object-centric perception from a brittle coordinate generation
problem into a robust feature retrieval task. Our method operates as a
plug-and-play module that integrates with any pre-trained VLM. It leverages a
Hybrid Fine-grained Region Encoder (HFRE), featuring a dual vision encoder, to
generate powerful region tokens rich in both semantic and spatial detail. A
token-based referencing system then enables the LLM to seamlessly reason about
and ground language in these specific visual regions. Experiments show that
VLM-FO1 achieves state-of-the-art performance across a diverse suite of
benchmarks, demonstrating exceptional capabilities in object grounding, region
generational understanding, and visual region reasoning. Crucially, our
two-stage training strategy ensures that these perception gains are achieved
without compromising the base model's general visual understanding
capabilities. VLM-FO1 establishes an effective and flexible paradigm for
building perception-aware VLMs, bridging the gap between high-level reasoning
and fine-grained visual grounding.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了训练数据特征对深度神经网络对抗鲁棒性的影响，发现对抗鲁棒性随数据量和模型规模呈对数缩放规律增长，但数据质量、架构和训练目标比原始规模在实现广谱对抗鲁棒性方面更具决定性作用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管深度神经网络在架构和训练范式方面取得了进展，但仍然容易受到对抗样本的攻击。研究旨在探索训练数据特征如何影响对抗鲁棒性，挑战仅靠规模就能驱动鲁棒性的假设。

Method: 评估了36个最先进的视觉模型，涵盖监督、自监督和对比学习方法，在1.2M到22B图像的数据集上训练。在六种黑盒攻击类别下评估：随机扰动、两种几何掩码、COCO对象操作、ImageNet-C损坏和ImageNet-R风格迁移。

Result: 对抗鲁棒性随数据量和模型规模呈对数缩放规律：数据量增加10倍平均降低攻击成功率约3.2%，模型规模增加10倍平均降低攻击成功率约13.4%。一些在精选数据集上训练的自监督模型优于在更大但较少精选数据集上训练的模型。

Conclusion: 虽然扩展规模能提高鲁棒性，但数据质量、架构和训练目标在实现广谱对抗鲁棒性方面比原始规模更具决定性作用。人类评估揭示了人类与机器视觉之间的持续差距。

Abstract: Deep neural networks remain vulnerable to adversarial examples despite
advances in architectures and training paradigms. We investigate how training
data characteristics affect adversarial robustness across 36 state-of-the-art
vision models spanning supervised, self-supervised, and contrastive learning
approaches, trained on datasets from 1.2M to 22B images. Models were evaluated
under six black-box attack categories: random perturbations, two types of
geometric masks, COCO object manipulations, ImageNet-C corruptions, and
ImageNet-R style shifts. Robustness follows a logarithmic scaling law with both
data volume and model size: a tenfold increase in data reduces attack success
rate (ASR) on average by ~3.2%, whereas a tenfold increase in model size
reduces ASR on average by ~13.4%. Notably, some self-supervised models trained
on curated datasets, such as DINOv2, outperform others trained on much larger
but less curated datasets, challenging the assumption that scale alone drives
robustness. Adversarial fine-tuning of ResNet50s improves generalization across
structural variations but not across color distributions. Human evaluation
reveals persistent gaps between human and machine vision. These results show
that while scaling improves robustness, data quality, architecture, and
training objectives play a more decisive role than raw scale in achieving
broad-spectrum adversarial resilience.

Conclusion: UniMMAD通过统一框架解决了多模态多类别异常检测中的碎片化和效率问题，实现了自适应解耦重建和高效推理。

Abstract: Existing anomaly detection (AD) methods often treat the modality and class as
independent factors. Although this paradigm has enriched the development of AD
research branches and produced many specialized models, it has also led to
fragmented solutions and excessive memory overhead. Moreover,
reconstruction-based multi-class approaches typically rely on shared decoding
paths, which struggle to handle large variations across domains, resulting in
distorted normality boundaries, domain interference, and high false alarm
rates. To address these limitations, we propose UniMMAD, a unified framework
for multi-modal and multi-class anomaly detection. At the core of UniMMAD is a
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)-driven feature decompression mechanism, which enables
adaptive and disentangled reconstruction tailored to specific domains. This
process is guided by a ``general to specific'' paradigm. In the encoding stage,
multi-modal inputs of varying combinations are compressed into compact,
general-purpose features. The encoder incorporates a feature compression module
to suppress latent anomalies, encourage cross-modal interaction, and avoid
shortcut learning. In the decoding stage, the general features are decompressed
into modality-specific and class-specific forms via a sparsely-gated cross MoE,
which dynamically selects expert pathways based on input modality and class. To
further improve efficiency, we design a grouped dynamic filtering mechanism and
a MoE-in-MoE structure, reducing parameter usage by 75\% while maintaining
sparse activation and fast inference. UniMMAD achieves state-of-the-art
performance on 9 anomaly detection datasets, spanning 3 fields, 12 modalities,
and 66 classes.

*Debottam Dutta,Jianchong Chen,Rajalaxmi Rajagopalan,Yu-Lin Wei,Romit Roy Choudhury*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出CO3方法，通过校正采样策略改善文本到图像扩散模型中多概念提示的保真度，避免概念缺失或碰撞问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多概念提示（如"猫和狗"）在扩散模型中常出现的概念缺失、模糊或碰撞问题，这些是由于模型在训练过程中对某些概念学习过强导致的模式混合

Method: 引入校正采样策略，引导模型远离联合提示行为与单个概念重叠过强的区域，转向所有概念能够平衡共存的"纯净"联合模式；分析现有多概念引导方案的不稳定权重机制，并调整采样以保持在有利区域

Result: 在多样化多概念提示上的实验表明，相比标准基线和先前组合方法，CO3在概念覆盖度、平衡性和鲁棒性方面均有改进，减少了概念丢失或扭曲的情况

Conclusion: 轻量级的校正引导可以显著缓解现代扩散系统中脆弱的语义对齐行为，该方法无需模型调优，可与标准无分类器引导互补使用

Abstract: We propose to improve multi-concept prompt fidelity in text-to-image
diffusion models. We begin with common failure cases-prompts like "a cat and a
dog" that sometimes yields images where one concept is missing, faint, or
colliding awkwardly with another. We hypothesize that this happens when the
diffusion model drifts into mixed modes that over-emphasize a single concept it
learned strongly during training. Instead of re-training, we introduce a
corrective sampling strategy that steers away from regions where the joint
prompt behavior overlaps too strongly with any single concept in the prompt.
The goal is to steer towards "pure" joint modes where all concepts can coexist
with balanced visual presence. We further show that existing multi-concept
guidance schemes can operate in unstable weight regimes that amplify imbalance;
we characterize favorable regions and adapt sampling to remain within them. Our
approach, CO3, is plug-and-play, requires no model tuning, and complements
standard classifier-free guidance. Experiments on diverse multi-concept prompts
indicate improvements in concept coverage, balance and robustness, with fewer
dropped or distorted concepts compared to standard baselines and prior
compositional methods. Results suggest that lightweight corrective guidance can
substantially mitigate brittle semantic alignment behavior in modern diffusion
systems.

TL;DR: 提出SS-ACL框架，无需专家标注即可生成基于视觉证据的医学报告，通过解剖一致性学习和对比学习提升报告准确性和临床有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖单独训练的检测模块，需要大量专家标注，成本高且因病理分布偏差导致泛化性受限。

Method: 使用自监督解剖一致性学习，构建分层解剖图，通过递归重建解剖区域实现空间对齐，结合区域级对比学习增强语义对齐。

Result: 在词汇准确性上超越现有方法10%，临床有效性提升25%，在零样本视觉定位任务中超越领先视觉基础模型8%。

Conclusion: SS-ACL无需专家标注即可生成准确且可解释的医学报告，在多个下游视觉任务中表现优异。

Abstract: Vision-grounded medical report generation aims to produce clinically accurate
descriptions of medical images, anchored in explicit visual evidence to improve
interpretability and facilitate integration into clinical workflows. However,
existing methods often rely on separately trained detection modules that
require extensive expert annotations, introducing high labeling costs and
limiting generalizability due to pathology distribution bias across datasets.
To address these challenges, we propose Self-Supervised Anatomical Consistency
Learning (SS-ACL) -- a novel and annotation-free framework that aligns
generated reports with corresponding anatomical regions using simple textual
prompts. SS-ACL constructs a hierarchical anatomical graph inspired by the
invariant top-down inclusion structure of human anatomy, organizing entities by
spatial location. It recursively reconstructs fine-grained anatomical regions
to enforce intra-sample spatial alignment, inherently guiding attention maps
toward visually relevant areas prompted by text. To further enhance
inter-sample semantic alignment for abnormality recognition, SS-ACL introduces
a region-level contrastive learning based on anatomical consistency. These
aligned embeddings serve as priors for report generation, enabling attention
maps to provide interpretable visual evidence. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that SS-ACL, without relying on expert annotations, (i) generates
accurate and visually grounded reports -- outperforming state-of-the-art
methods by 10\% in lexical accuracy and 25\% in clinical efficacy, and (ii)
achieves competitive performance on various downstream visual tasks, surpassing
current leading visual foundation models by 8\% in zero-shot visual grounding.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有计算机视觉方法在鲑鱼福利监测中存在资源需求高、易受水下场景干扰的问题，需要更高效和鲁棒的解决方案。

Method: 使用姿态估计网络提取鲑鱼边界框和身体部位，通过专门模块处理水下场景挑战，利用高细节身体部位轨迹计算福利指标。

Result: 在鲑鱼跟踪挑战中优于当前最先进的行人跟踪器BoostTrack，并验证了该方法适用于基于尾鳍摆动的自动化福利监测。

Conclusion: 该方法为工业水产养殖网箱中的鲑鱼福利监测提供了更有效和可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Computer Vision (CV)-based continuous, automated and precise salmon welfare
monitoring is a key step toward reduced salmon mortality and improved salmon
welfare in industrial aquaculture net pens. Available CV methods for
determining welfare indicators focus on single indicators and rely on object
detectors and trackers from other application areas to aid their welfare
indicator calculation algorithm. This comes with a high resource demand for
real-world applications, since each indicator must be calculated separately. In
addition, the methods are vulnerable to difficulties in underwater salmon
scenes, such as object occlusion, similar object appearance, and similar object
motion. To address these challenges, we propose a flexible tracking framework
that uses a pose estimation network to extract bounding boxes around salmon and
their corresponding body parts, and exploits information about the body parts,
through specialized modules, to tackle challenges specific to underwater salmon
scenes. Subsequently, the high-detail body part tracks are employed to
calculate welfare indicators. We construct two novel datasets assessing two
salmon tracking challenges: salmon ID transfers in crowded scenes and salmon ID
switches during turning. Our method outperforms the current state-of-the-art
pedestrian tracker, BoostTrack, for both salmon tracking challenges.
Additionally, we create a dataset for calculating salmon tail beat wavelength,
demonstrating that our body part tracking method is well-suited for automated
welfare monitoring based on tail beat analysis. Datasets and code are available
at https://github.com/espenbh/BoostCompTrack.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有交互式分割方法局限于粗粒度的实例级目标，而非交互式方法难以处理稀疏的真实世界扫描数据，且缺乏标注数据。

Method: 开发了新的3D数据合成流水线来创建大规模场景级数据集，包含密集部件标注；提出了基于少量用户点点击的交互式分割框架。

Result: 在首次点击设置下平均IoU达到55.8%，仅需少量额外点击即可超过71.3% IoU；相比现有最佳基线方法，IoU和精度提升高达16%。

Conclusion: 这项工作在复杂3D环境中实现更细致和精确的机器感知与交互方面迈出了重要一步。

Abstract: Fine-grained 3D part segmentation is crucial for enabling embodied AI systems
to perform complex manipulation tasks, such as interacting with specific
functional components of an object. However, existing interactive segmentation
methods are largely confined to coarse, instance-level targets, while
non-interactive approaches struggle with sparse, real-world scans and suffer
from a severe lack of annotated data. To address these limitations, we
introduce PinPoint3D, a novel interactive framework for fine-grained,
multi-granularity 3D segmentation, capable of generating precise part-level
masks from only a few user point clicks. A key component of our work is a new
3D data synthesis pipeline that we developed to create a large-scale,
scene-level dataset with dense part annotations, overcoming a critical
bottleneck that has hindered progress in this field. Through comprehensive
experiments and user studies, we demonstrate that our method significantly
outperforms existing approaches, achieving an average IoU of around 55.8% on
each object part under first-click settings and surpassing 71.3% IoU with only
a few additional clicks. Compared to current state-of-the-art baselines,
PinPoint3D yields up to a 16% improvement in IoU and precision, highlighting
its effectiveness on challenging, sparse point clouds with high efficiency. Our
work represents a significant step towards more nuanced and precise machine
perception and interaction in complex 3D environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前VICL方法基于相似性优先假设缺乏充分理论依据，且Partial2Global依赖随机采样导致覆盖不完整和冗余比较，影响全局排序质量。

Method: 使用jackknife conformal prediction构建可靠的替代集，结合covering design采样方法确保成对偏好的全面均匀覆盖。

Result: 大量实验表明RH-Partial2Global在多种视觉任务中表现出色，优于Partial2Global方法。

Conclusion: RH-Partial2Global通过更可靠的替代集构建和更全面的采样策略，显著提升了视觉上下文学习中示例选择的效果。

Abstract: Visual In-Context Learning (VICL) has emerged as a prominent approach for
adapting visual foundation models to novel tasks, by effectively exploiting
contextual information embedded in in-context examples, which can be formulated
as a global ranking problem of potential candidates. Current VICL methods, such
as Partial2Global and VPR, are grounded in the similarity-priority assumption
that images more visually similar to a query image serve as better in-context
examples. This foundational assumption, while intuitive, lacks sufficient
justification for its efficacy in selecting optimal in-context examples.
Furthermore, Partial2Global constructs its global ranking from a series of
randomly sampled pairwise preference predictions. Such a reliance on random
sampling can lead to incomplete coverage and redundant samplings of
comparisons, thus further adversely impacting the final global ranking. To
address these issues, this paper introduces an enhanced variant of
Partial2Global designed for reliable and holistic selection of in-context
examples in VICL. Our proposed method, dubbed RH-Partial2Global, leverages a
jackknife conformal prediction-guided strategy to construct reliable
alternative sets and a covering design-based sampling approach to ensure
comprehensive and uniform coverage of pairwise preferences. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that RH-Partial2Global achieves excellent performance
and outperforms Partial2Global across diverse visual tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频编辑模型因传统注意力机制的二次计算复杂度，难以处理长时长和高分辨率视频，限制了实时视频处理等实际应用。

Method: 将线性时空聚合模块集成到基于扩散的视频模型中，利用RWKV变换器的双向加权键值循环机制捕获全局依赖并保持时间一致性。

Result: 相比最先进的基于扩散的视频编辑方法，实现3.7倍加速和60%内存节省，在帧一致性和文本对齐方面保持竞争力。

Conclusion: VRWKV-Editor在线性复杂度下有效解决了长视频编辑的计算瓶颈，随着视频序列长度增加，相比自注意力架构的速度优势更加显著。

Abstract: In light of recent progress in video editing, deep learning models focusing
on both spatial and temporal dependencies have emerged as the primary method.
However, these models suffer from the quadratic computational complexity of
traditional attention mechanisms, making them difficult to adapt to
long-duration and high-resolution videos. This limitation restricts their
applicability in practical contexts such as real-time video processing. To
tackle this challenge, we introduce a method to reduce both time and space
complexity of these systems by proposing VRWKV-Editor, a novel video editing
model that integrates a linear spatio-temporal aggregation module into
video-based diffusion models. VRWKV-Editor leverages bidirectional weighted
key-value recurrence mechanism of the RWKV transformer to capture global
dependencies while preserving temporal coherence, achieving linear complexity
without sacrificing quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the
proposed method achieves up to 3.7x speedup and 60% lower memory usage compared
to state-of-the-art diffusion-based video editing methods, while maintaining
competitive performance in frame consistency and text alignment. Furthermore, a
comparative analysis we conducted on videos with different sequence lengths
confirms that the gap in editing speed between our approach and architectures
with self-attention becomes more significant with long videos.

Conclusion: 叙述监督为手部物体分割提供有效的弱监督形式，WISH模型展示了从自然语言中学习手-物体关联的潜力。

Abstract: Pixel-level recognition of objects manipulated by the user from egocentric
images enables key applications spanning assistive technologies, industrial
safety, and activity monitoring. However, progress in this area is currently
hindered by the scarcity of annotated datasets, as existing approaches rely on
costly manual labels. In this paper, we propose to learn human-object
interaction detection leveraging narrations -- natural language descriptions of
the actions performed by the camera wearer which contain clues about
manipulated objects (e.g., "I am pouring vegetables from the chopping board to
the pan"). Narrations provide a form of weak supervision that is cheap to
acquire and readily available in state-of-the-art egocentric datasets. We
introduce Narration-Supervised in-Hand Object Segmentation (NS-iHOS), a novel
task where models have to learn to segment in-hand objects by learning from
natural-language narrations. Narrations are then not employed at inference
time. We showcase the potential of the task by proposing Weakly-Supervised
In-hand Object Segmentation from Human Narrations (WISH), an end-to-end model
distilling knowledge from narrations to learn plausible hand-object
associations and enable in-hand object segmentation without using narrations at
test time. We benchmark WISH against different baselines based on
open-vocabulary object detectors and vision-language models, showing the
superiority of its design. Experiments on EPIC-Kitchens and Ego4D show that
WISH surpasses all baselines, recovering more than 50% of the performance of
fully supervised methods, without employing fine-grained pixel-wise
annotations.

TL;DR: 提出了AgenticIQA框架，将视觉语言模型与传统IQA工具动态集成，通过分解IQA任务为四个子任务来提高评分准确性和解释能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统IQA方法使用固定模型输出标量分数，限制了其对不同失真、用户特定查询和可解释性需求的适应性。评分和解释通常被独立处理，尽管它们是相互依赖的。

Method: AgenticIQA将IQA分解为四个子任务：失真检测、失真分析、工具选择和工具执行，由规划器、执行器和总结器协调。规划器制定任务特定策略，执行器通过工具调用收集感知证据，总结器整合证据生成准确分数和人类对齐的解释。

Result: 在多个IQA数据集上的广泛实验表明，AgenticIQA在评分准确性和解释对齐方面始终优于强基线方法。

Conclusion: AgenticIQA通过模块化代理框架有效解决了传统IQA方法的局限性，提供了更好的适应性和可解释性。

Abstract: Image quality assessment (IQA) is inherently complex, as it reflects both the
quantification and interpretation of perceptual quality rooted in the human
visual system. Conventional approaches typically rely on fixed models to output
scalar scores, limiting their adaptability to diverse distortions,
user-specific queries, and interpretability needs. Furthermore, scoring and
interpretation are often treated as independent processes, despite their
interdependence: interpretation identifies perceptual degradations, while
scoring abstracts them into a compact metric. To address these limitations, we
propose AgenticIQA, a modular agentic framework that integrates vision-language
models (VLMs) with traditional IQA tools in a dynamic, query-aware manner.
AgenticIQA decomposes IQA into four subtasks -- distortion detection,
distortion analysis, tool selection, and tool execution -- coordinated by a
planner, executor, and summarizer. The planner formulates task-specific
strategies, the executor collects perceptual evidence via tool invocation, and
the summarizer integrates this evidence to produce accurate scores with
human-aligned explanations. To support training and evaluation, we introduce
AgenticIQA-200K, a large-scale instruction dataset tailored for IQA agents, and
AgenticIQA-Eval, the first benchmark for assessing the planning, execution, and
summarization capabilities of VLM-based IQA agents. Extensive experiments
across diverse IQA datasets demonstrate that AgenticIQA consistently surpasses
strong baselines in both scoring accuracy and explanatory alignment.

Result: 在KITTI-360和RealHet数据集上超越了当前主流深度网络，达到了最先进的性能水平。

Conclusion: 这是首个系统研究异构针孔-鱼眼深度估计的工作，提供了技术新颖性和有价值的实证见解。

Abstract: In this paper, we present the first pinhole-fisheye framework for
heterogeneous multi-view depth estimation, PFDepth. Our key insight is to
exploit the complementary characteristics of pinhole and fisheye imagery
(undistorted vs. distorted, small vs. large FOV, far vs. near field) for joint
optimization. PFDepth employs a unified architecture capable of processing
arbitrary combinations of pinhole and fisheye cameras with varied intrinsics
and extrinsics. Within PFDepth, we first explicitly lift 2D features from each
heterogeneous view into a canonical 3D volumetric space. Then, a core module
termed Heterogeneous Spatial Fusion is designed to process and fuse
distortion-aware volumetric features across overlapping and non-overlapping
regions. Additionally, we subtly reformulate the conventional voxel fusion into
a novel 3D Gaussian representation, in which learnable latent Gaussian spheres
dynamically adapt to local image textures for finer 3D aggregation. Finally,
fused volume features are rendered into multi-view depth maps. Through
extensive experiments, we demonstrate that PFDepth sets a state-of-the-art
performance on KITTI-360 and RealHet datasets over current mainstream depth
networks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic study of
heterogeneous pinhole-fisheye depth estimation, offering both technical novelty
and valuable empirical insights.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统二阶PDE模型在去噪早期会引入块状伪影，需要开发更有效的模型来同时实现噪声抑制和细节保留。

Method: 使用四阶非线性PDE模型，其中扩散过程由拉普拉斯算子和强度值引导，波动部分负责保持精细细节和纹理。模型可扩展到彩色图像处理。

Result: 在PSNR、MSSIM和SI指标上均优于现有的二阶各向异性扩散方法，在灰度图和彩色图像上都取得了更好的去噪效果。

Conclusion: 所提出的四阶PDE模型在抑制乘性噪声方面比现有模型表现更优，能有效减少伪影并保持图像细节。

Abstract: Second-order PDE models have been widely used for suppressing multiplicative
noise, but they often introduce blocky artifacts in the early stages of
denoising. To resolve this, we propose a fourth-order nonlinear PDE model that
integrates diffusion and wave properties. The diffusion process, guided by both
the Laplacian and intensity values, reduces noise better than gradient-based
methods, while the wave part keeps fine details and textures. The effectiveness
of the proposed model is evaluated against two second-order anisotropic
diffusion approaches using the Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Mean
Structural Similarity Index (MSSIM) for images with available ground truth. For
SAR images, where a noise-free reference is unavailable, the Speckle Index (SI)
is used to measure noise reduction. Additionally, we extend the proposed model
to study color images by applying the denoising process independently to each
channel, preserving both structure and color consistency. The same quantitative
metrics PSNR and MSSIM are used for performance evaluation, ensuring a fair
comparison across grayscale and color images. In all the cases, our computed
results produce better results compared to existing models in this genre.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SETR提出了一种语义增强的两阶段检索方法，通过交集驱动策略和多模态LLM重排序，解决了零样本组合图像检索中的特征融合不精确和语义关系解析不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于CLIP的方法面临两个核心挑战：基于并集的特征融合会携带无关背景细节，以及全局余弦相似度无法解析细粒度语义关系。

Method: SETR采用两阶段检索：粗检索阶段使用交集驱动策略保留参考图像和相对文本的重叠语义；重排序阶段使用多模态LLM进行二元语义相关性判断。

Result: 在CIRR、Fashion-IQ和CIRCO数据集上达到新的最先进性能，在CIRR上的Recall@1提升高达15.15个百分点。

Conclusion: 两阶段推理成为稳健且可移植的零样本组合图像检索的通用范式。

Abstract: Zero-shot Composed Image Retrieval (ZS-CIR) aims to retrieve a target image
given a reference image and a relative text, without relying on costly triplet
annotations. Existing CLIP-based methods face two core challenges: (1)
union-based feature fusion indiscriminately aggregates all visual cues,
carrying over irrelevant background details that dilute the intended
modification, and (2) global cosine similarity from CLIP embeddings lacks the
ability to resolve fine-grained semantic relations. To address these issues, we
propose SETR (Semantic-enhanced Two-Stage Retrieval). In the coarse retrieval
stage, SETR introduces an intersection-driven strategy that retains only the
overlapping semantics between the reference image and relative text, thereby
filtering out distractors inherent to union-based fusion and producing a
cleaner, high-precision candidate set. In the fine-grained re-ranking stage, we
adapt a pretrained multimodal LLM with Low-Rank Adaptation to conduct binary
semantic relevance judgments ("Yes/No"), which goes beyond CLIP's global
feature matching by explicitly verifying relational and attribute-level
consistency. Together, these two stages form a complementary pipeline: coarse
retrieval narrows the candidate pool with high recall, while re-ranking ensures
precise alignment with nuanced textual modifications. Experiments on CIRR,
Fashion-IQ, and CIRCO show that SETR achieves new state-of-the-art performance,
improving Recall@1 on CIRR by up to 15.15 points. Our results establish
two-stage reasoning as a general paradigm for robust and portable ZS-CIR.

Motivation: 将地面地理空间数据与遥感基础模型整合对于推进地理空间智能至关重要，但遥感数据与OSM数据在数据结构、内容和空间粒度上存在模态差距，使得有效协同极具挑战性。

Method: 在预训练阶段使用OSM数据提供的多粒度学习信号，通过跨模态空间关联进行信息交互与协作，并引入图像掩码重建实现稀疏输入的高效预训练；在下游任务阶段生成单模态和多模态细粒度编码。

Conclusion: 多模态协同在推进高级地理空间人工智能方面具有巨大潜力，空间关联在实现有效的多模态地理空间数据整合中起着关键作用。

Abstract: Integrating ground-level geospatial data with rich geographic context, like
OpenStreetMap (OSM), into remote sensing (RS) foundation models (FMs) is
essential for advancing geospatial intelligence and supporting a broad spectrum
of tasks. However, modality gap between RS and OSM data, including differences
in data structure, content, and spatial granularity, makes effective synergy
highly challenging, and most existing RS FMs focus on imagery alone. To this
end, this study presents GeoLink, a multimodal framework that leverages OSM
data to enhance RS FM during both the pretraining and downstream task stages.
Specifically, GeoLink enhances RS self-supervised pretraining using
multi-granularity learning signals derived from OSM data, guided by cross-modal
spatial correlations for information interaction and collaboration. It also
introduces image mask-reconstruction to enable sparse input for efficient
pretraining. For downstream tasks, GeoLink generates both unimodal and
multimodal fine-grained encodings to support a wide range of applications, from
common RS interpretation tasks like land cover classification to more
comprehensive geographic tasks like urban function zone mapping. Extensive
experiments show that incorporating OSM data during pretraining enhances the
performance of the RS image encoder, while fusing RS and OSM data in downstream
tasks improves the FM's adaptability to complex geographic scenarios. These
results underscore the potential of multimodal synergy in advancing high-level
geospatial artificial intelligence. Moreover, we find that spatial correlation
plays a crucial role in enabling effective multimodal geospatial data
integration. Code, checkpoints, and using examples are released at

Abstract: Pre-trained video generation models hold great potential for generative video
super-resolution (VSR). However, adapting them for full-size VSR, as most
existing methods do, suffers from unnecessary intensive full-attention
computation and fixed output resolution. To overcome these limitations, we make
the first exploration into utilizing video diffusion priors for patch-wise VSR.
This is non-trivial because pre-trained video diffusion models are not native
for patch-level detail generation. To mitigate this challenge, we propose an
innovative approach, called PatchVSR, which integrates a dual-stream adapter
for conditional guidance. The patch branch extracts features from input patches
to maintain content fidelity while the global branch extracts context features
from the resized full video to bridge the generation gap caused by incomplete
semantics of patches. Particularly, we also inject the patch's location
information into the model to better contextualize patch synthesis within the
global video frame. Experiments demonstrate that our method can synthesize
high-fidelity, high-resolution details at the patch level. A tailor-made
multi-patch joint modulation is proposed to ensure visual consistency across
individually enhanced patches. Due to the flexibility of our patch-based
paradigm, we can achieve highly competitive 4K VSR based on a 512x512
resolution base model, with extremely high efficiency.

*Haoran Pei,Yuguang Yang,Kexin Liu,Baochang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出CGP框架，通过基于ViT的因果掩码引导空间变化高斯噪声注入，增强OOD泛化能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决深度学习中OOD泛化的核心挑战，特别是在生物医学图像领域，现有方法追求域不变性但可能忽略因果机制

Method: 使用Vision Transformers生成软因果掩码，在输入图像中注入空间变化的高斯噪声——背景区域强扰动，前景区域弱扰动

Result: 在WILDS基准测试Camelyon17上表现优于最先进的OOD基线方法

Conclusion: 因果扰动是可靠且可解释泛化的有潜力工具

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization remains a central challenge in
deploying deep learning models to real-world scenarios, particularly in domains
such as biomedical images, where distribution shifts are both subtle and
pervasive. While existing methods often pursue domain invariance through
complex generative models or adversarial training, these approaches may
overlook the underlying causal mechanisms of generalization.In this work, we
propose Causally-Guided Gaussian Perturbations (CGP)-a lightweight framework
that enhances OOD generalization by injecting spatially varying noise into
input images, guided by soft causal masks derived from Vision Transformers. By
applying stronger perturbations to background regions and weaker ones to
foreground areas, CGP encourages the model to rely on causally relevant
features rather than spurious correlations.Experimental results on the
challenging WILDS benchmark Camelyon17 demonstrate consistent performance gains
over state-of-the-art OOD baselines, highlighting the potential of causal
perturbation as a tool for reliable and interpretable generalization.

*Christoph Timmermann,Hyunse Lee,Woojin Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SeMoBridge通过语义模态桥将图像映射到文本模态，解决了CLIP在少样本分类中的模态内不对齐问题，在低数据场景下表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP在零样本任务中表现良好，但在少样本分类中存在模态内不对齐问题，这是由于模态间隙和仅跨模态训练目标导致的，使得图像间直接比较不可靠。

Method: 提出SeMoBridge方法，通过语义模态桥将图像映射到文本模态，保持语义内容不变。该方法有闭式解，也可通过多模态监督训练，结合图像和文本对齐损失优化投影。

Result: 训练版本SeMoBridge-T仅需少量训练时间，整体性能优于其他方法，特别是在低数据场景（1、2、4样本）中表现突出。

Conclusion: SeMoBridge有效解决了CLIP在少样本分类中的模态内不对齐问题，提供了一种轻量级且强大的解决方案。

Abstract: While Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) excels at zero-shot tasks
by aligning image and text embeddings, its performance in few-shot
classification is hindered by a critical limitation: intra-modal misalignment.
This issue, caused by a persistent modality gap and CLIP's exclusively
inter-modal training objective, leaves the embedding spaces uncalibrated,
making direct image-to-image comparisons unreliable. Existing methods attempt
to address this by refining similarity logits or by computationally expensive
per-sample optimization. To overcome these challenges, we introduce SeMoBridge,
a lightweight yet powerful approach that directly addresses the misalignment.
Our method maps images into the text modality, while keeping their semantic
content intact through what we call a Semantic Modality Bridge. SeMoBridge is
closed-form and can optionally be trained through multi-modal supervision,
combining image and text-alignment losses to optimize the projection.
Experiments show that the trained version, SeMoBridge-T, requires only a
fraction of the training time while overall outperforming other methods,
particularly in low-data scenarios (1, 2, and 4 shots). The code is available

TL;DR: 扩展HAMMER模型以处理全局场景不一致性，提出轻量级分割引导评分(SGS)管道，无需重新训练即可显著提升对全局篡改的检测能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HAMMER在多模态篡改检测中表现优异，但在处理前景-背景不匹配等全局场景不一致时持续失败，存在标签空间偏差、局部注意力焦点和虚假文本-前景对齐问题

Method: 提出分割引导评分(SGS)管道：使用人物/人脸分割掩码分离前景和背景区域，通过联合视觉语言模型提取嵌入，计算区域感知一致性分数，并与HAMMER原始预测融合

Result: SGS显著增强了HAMMER对全局篡改的鲁棒性，改进了二元检测、定位和token级解释，仅需推理阶段且计算开销可忽略

Conclusion: 这项工作证明了区域感知推理在多模态虚假信息检测中的重要性，为处理全局场景不一致提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: We extend HAMMER, a state-of-the-art model for multimodal manipulation
detection, to handle global scene inconsistencies such as foreground-background
(FG-BG) mismatch. While HAMMER achieves strong performance on the DGM4 dataset,
it consistently fails when the main subject is contextually misplaced into an
implausible background. We diagnose this limitation as a combination of
label-space bias, local attention focus, and spurious text-foreground
alignment. To remedy this without retraining, we propose a lightweight
segmentation-guided scoring (SGS) pipeline. SGS uses person/face segmentation
masks to separate foreground and background regions, extracts embeddings with a
joint vision-language model, and computes region-aware coherence scores. These
scores are fused with HAMMER's original prediction to improve binary detection,
grounding, and token-level explanations. SGS is inference-only, incurs
negligible computational overhead, and significantly enhances robustness to
global manipulations. This work demonstrates the importance of region-aware
reasoning in multimodal disinformation detection. We release scripts for
segmentation and scoring at https://github.com/Gaganx0/HAMMER-sgs

TL;DR: 该论文扩展了DGM4数据集，增加了5000个包含前景-背景不匹配及其与文本操作混合的高质量样本，创建了DGM4+基准数据集，旨在测试检测器在局部和全局推理方面的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有DGM4数据集仅限于局部操作（如人脸交换、属性编辑和标题更改），而忽略了真实世界伪造中普遍存在的前景-背景不匹配等全局不一致性问题。

Method: 使用OpenAI的gpt-image-1生成以人为中心的新闻风格图像，将真实人物置于荒谬或不可能的背景下，并在三种条件下生成标题（字面、文本属性和文本分割），创建三种新的操作类别。

Result: 创建了包含FG-BG、FG-BG+TA和FG-BG+TS三种操作类别的DGM4+数据集，包含5000个高质量样本，具有质量控制管道确保数据质量。

Conclusion: DGM4+数据集填补了全局操作的研究空白，为多模态模型（如HAMMER）的评估提供了更全面的基准，这些模型目前在前景-背景不一致性方面存在困难。

Abstract: The rapid advances in generative models have significantly lowered the
barrier to producing convincing multimodal disinformation. Fabricated images
and manipulated captions increasingly co-occur to create persuasive false
narratives. While the Detecting and Grounding Multi-Modal Media Manipulation
(DGM4) dataset established a foundation for research in this area, it is
restricted to local manipulations such as face swaps, attribute edits, and
caption changes. This leaves a critical gap: global inconsistencies, such as
mismatched foregrounds and backgrounds, which are now prevalent in real-world
forgeries. To address this, we extend DGM4 with 5,000 high-quality samples that
introduce Foreground-Background (FG-BG) mismatches and their hybrids with text
manipulations. Using OpenAI's gpt-image-1 and carefully designed prompts, we
generate human-centric news-style images where authentic figures are placed
into absurd or impossible backdrops (e.g., a teacher calmly addressing students
on the surface of Mars). Captions are produced under three conditions: literal,
text attribute, and text split, yielding three new manipulation categories:
FG-BG, FG-BG+TA, and FG-BG+TS. Quality control pipelines enforce one-to-three
visible faces, perceptual hash deduplication, OCR-based text scrubbing, and
realistic headline length. By introducing global manipulations, our extension
complements existing datasets, creating a benchmark DGM4+ that tests detectors
on both local and global reasoning. This resource is intended to strengthen
evaluation of multimodal models such as HAMMER, which currently struggle with
FG-BG inconsistencies. We release our DGM4+ dataset and generation script at
https://github.com/Gaganx0/DGM4plus

Motivation: 计算机视觉和医学数据集通常包含对称性（如旋转、缩放），传统方法使用数据增强来学习这些对称性，但这种方法不够可持续。本文旨在避免数据增强，构建更可持续的算法。

Method: 使用主纤维丛的截面概念来模掉对称性，通过简单的度量来测量对称群作用下对象轨道之间的差异。提出一个包含恒定速度参数化作为特例的2参数曲线规范参数化族，并优化截面以最大化类别分离。

Result: 在包含平移、旋转、缩放和重参数化对称性的对象轮廓数据集上验证了该方法，展示了其有效性。提供了开源代码和教程笔记本。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种简单有效的几何学习框架，能够处理各种对称性问题，具有广泛的应用潜力。几何概念为该方法的理论基础，可在多个领域应用。

Abstract: Most datasets encountered in computer vision and medical applications present
symmetries that should be taken into account in classification tasks. A typical
example is the symmetry by rotation and/or scaling in object detection. A
common way to build neural networks that learn the symmetries is to use data
augmentation. In order to avoid data augmentation and build more sustainable
algorithms, we present an alternative method to mod out symmetries based on the
notion of section of a principal fiber bundle. This framework allows the use of
simple metrics on the space of objects in order to measure dissimilarities
between orbits of objects under the symmetry group. Moreover, the section used
can be optimized to maximize separation of classes. We illustrate this
methodology on a dataset of contours of objects for the groups of translations,
rotations, scalings and reparameterizations. In particular, we present a
$2$-parameter family of canonical parameterizations of curves, containing the
constant-speed parameterization as a special case, which we believe is
interesting in its own right. We hope that this simple application will serve
to convey the geometric concepts underlying this method, which have a wide
range of possible applications. The code is available at the following link:

TL;DR: 提出使用基础模型生成3D伪标签的方法，解决自监督语义占用预测中计算成本高的问题，显著提升性能并实现跨架构兼容性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统自监督方法如新视角合成等计算成本和内存使用过高，且难以迁移到其他架构。需要一种高效且通用的解决方案。

Method: 使用Grounded-SAM和Metric3Dv2基础模型生成3D伪标签，并利用时序信息进行标签稠密化。提出EasyOcc模型仅从伪标签学习。

Result: OccNeRF模型mIoU从9.73提升至14.09（提升45%），EasyOcc模型达到13.86 mIoU，在不使用相机掩码的全场景评估中达到7.71 mIoU，超越之前最佳模型31%。

Conclusion: 基础模型、时序上下文和损失计算空间的选择在自监督学习中对全面场景理解至关重要。

Abstract: Self-supervised models have recently achieved notable advancements,
particularly in the domain of semantic occupancy prediction. These models
utilize sophisticated loss computation strategies to compensate for the absence
of ground-truth labels. For instance, techniques such as novel view synthesis,
cross-view rendering, and depth estimation have been explored to address the
issue of semantic and depth ambiguity. However, such techniques typically incur
high computational costs and memory usage during the training stage, especially
in the case of novel view synthesis. To mitigate these issues, we propose 3D
pseudo-ground-truth labels generated by the foundation models Grounded-SAM and
Metric3Dv2, and harness temporal information for label densification. Our 3D
pseudo-labels can be easily integrated into existing models, which yields
substantial performance improvements, with mIoU increasing by 45\%, from 9.73
to 14.09, when implemented into the OccNeRF model. This stands in contrast to
earlier advancements in the field, which are often not readily transferable to
other architectures. Additionally, we propose a streamlined model, EasyOcc,
achieving 13.86 mIoU. This model conducts learning solely from our labels,
avoiding complex rendering strategies mentioned previously. Furthermore, our
method enables models to attain state-of-the-art performance when evaluated on
the full scene without applying the camera mask, with EasyOcc achieving 7.71
mIoU, outperforming the previous best model by 31\%. These findings highlight
the critical importance of foundation models, temporal context, and the choice
of loss computation space in self-supervised learning for comprehensive scene
understanding.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 点球经常决定冠军归属，但守门员必须在极短时间内从细微的生物力学线索中预判踢球者意图

Method: 采用双分支架构：MobileNetV2 CNN提取RGB帧空间特征，LSTM网络处理2D关键点并带有注意力机制，姿态关键点引导视觉关注任务相关区域，使用基于距离的阈值方法分割输入序列

Result: 在755个点球事件数据集上达到89%准确率，比纯视觉和纯姿态基线提升14-22%，推理时间22毫秒

Conclusion: 轻量级且可解释的设计适用于守门员训练、战术分析和实时比赛分析

Abstract: Penalty kicks often decide championships, yet goalkeepers must anticipate the
kicker's intent from subtle biomechanical cues within a very short time window.
This study introduces a real-time, multi-modal deep learning framework to
predict the direction of a penalty kick (left, middle, or right) before ball
contact. The model uses a dual-branch architecture: a MobileNetV2-based CNN
extracts spatial features from RGB frames, while 2D keypoints are processed by
an LSTM network with attention mechanisms. Pose-derived keypoints further guide
visual focus toward task-relevant regions. A distance-based thresholding method
segments input sequences immediately before ball contact, ensuring consistent
input across diverse footage. A custom dataset of 755 penalty kick events was
created from real match videos, with frame-level annotations for object
detection, shooter keypoints, and final ball placement. The model achieved 89%
accuracy on a held-out test set, outperforming visual-only and pose-only
baselines by 14-22%. With an inference time of 22 milliseconds, the lightweight
and interpretable design makes it suitable for goalkeeper training, tactical
analysis, and real-time game analytics.

Conclusion: 该工作不仅推动了文本到场景生成领域的发展，还展示了现代大型推理模型的高级空间推理能力，并发布了代码库以促进相关研究。

Abstract: Prompt-driven scene synthesis allows users to generate complete 3D
environments from textual descriptions. Current text-to-scene methods often
struggle with complex geometries and object transformations, and tend to show
weak adherence to complex instructions. We address these limitations by
introducing Reason-3D, a text-to-scene model powered by large reasoning models
(LRMs). Reason-3D integrates object retrieval using captions covering physical,
functional, and contextual attributes. Reason-3D then places the selected
objects based on implicit and explicit layout constraints, and refines their
positions with collision-aware spatial reasoning. Evaluated on instructions
ranging from simple to complex indoor configurations, Reason-3D significantly
outperforms previous methods in human-rated visual fidelity, adherence to
constraints, and asset retrieval quality. Beyond its contribution to the field
of text-to-scene generation, our work showcases the advanced spatial reasoning
abilities of modern LRMs. Additionally, we release the codebase to further the
research in object retrieval and placement with LRMs.

TL;DR: EVODiff是一种基于信息论的扩散模型推理优化方法，通过优化条件熵来系统性地减少去噪过程中的不确定性，显著提升生成质量和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在图像生成方面表现出色，但存在推理速度慢和训练-推理差异的问题。现有梯度求解器缺乏信息传输效率的理论基础。

Method: 从信息论角度分析扩散模型推理过程，提出条件熵最小化原则，开发熵感知方差优化方法(EVODiff)，通过优化条件方差来最小化转换和重构误差。

Result: 在CIFAR-10上，10次函数评估时重构误差降低45.5%(FID从5.10提升到2.78)；在ImageNet-256上，高质量样本的函数评估次数减少25%(从20次降至15次)；文本到图像生成质量提升且伪影减少。

Conclusion: 信息论视角为扩散模型推理提供了理论基础，EVODiff方法在生成质量和效率方面显著优于现有最先进的梯度求解器。

Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) excel in image generation, but suffer from slow
inference and the training-inference discrepancies. Although gradient-based
solvers like DPM-Solver accelerate the denoising inference, they lack
theoretical foundations in information transmission efficiency. In this work,
we introduce an information-theoretic perspective on the inference processes of
DMs, revealing that successful denoising fundamentally reduces conditional
entropy in reverse transitions. This principle leads to our key insights into
the inference processes: (1) data prediction parameterization outperforms its
noise counterpart, and (2) optimizing conditional variance offers a
reference-free way to minimize both transition and reconstruction errors. Based
on these insights, we propose an entropy-aware variance optimized method for
the generative process of DMs, called EVODiff, which systematically reduces
uncertainty by optimizing conditional entropy during denoising. Extensive
experiments on DMs validate our insights and demonstrate that our method
significantly and consistently outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA)
gradient-based solvers. For example, compared to the DPM-Solver++, EVODiff
reduces the reconstruction error by up to 45.5\% (FID improves from 5.10 to
2.78) at 10 function evaluations (NFE) on CIFAR-10, cuts the NFE cost by 25\%
(from 20 to 15 NFE) for high-quality samples on ImageNet-256, and improves
text-to-image generation while reducing artifacts. Code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EchoGen是一个基于视觉自回归模型(VAR)的主题驱动生成框架，通过双路径注入策略实现高效、高质量的主题驱动图像生成，解决了现有方法在效率和零样本能力之间的权衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前主题驱动生成方法存在明显权衡：要么依赖计算昂贵的逐主题微调，牺牲效率和零样本能力；要么使用基于扩散模型的前馈架构，但推理速度缓慢。VAR模型以其快速采样速度和强大生成质量成为理想但未被充分探索的基础。

Method: EchoGen采用双路径注入策略：1) 语义编码器提取主题的抽象身份，通过解耦交叉注意力注入以指导整体构图；2) 内容编码器捕获精细视觉细节，通过多模态注意力机制集成以确保高保真纹理和结构保留。

Result: 定量和定性结果证实了设计有效性，EchoGen在主题保真度和图像质量上与最先进的基于扩散的方法相当，但采样延迟显著降低。

Conclusion: EchoGen是首个基于VAR模型的前馈主题驱动框架，成功解决了主题驱动生成中效率与质量之间的权衡问题，为快速高质量的主题驱动生成提供了新方向。

Abstract: Subject-driven generation is a critical task in creative AI; yet current
state-of-the-art methods present a stark trade-off. They either rely on
computationally expensive, per-subject fine-tuning, sacrificing efficiency and
zero-shot capability, or employ feed-forward architectures built on diffusion
models, which are inherently plagued by slow inference speeds. Visual
Auto-Regressive (VAR) models are renowned for their rapid sampling speeds and
strong generative quality, making them an ideal yet underexplored foundation
for resolving this tension. To bridge this gap, we introduce EchoGen, a
pioneering framework that empowers VAR models with subject-driven generation
capabilities. The core design of EchoGen is an effective dual-path injection
strategy that disentangles a subject's high-level semantic identity from its
low-level fine-grained details, enabling enhanced controllability and fidelity.
We employ a semantic encoder to extract the subject's abstract identity, which
is injected through decoupled cross-attention to guide the overall composition.
Concurrently, a content encoder captures intricate visual details, which are
integrated via a multi-modal attention mechanism to ensure high-fidelity
texture and structural preservation. To the best of our knowledge, EchoGen is
the first feed-forward subject-driven framework built upon VAR models. Both
quantitative and qualitative results substantiate our design, demonstrating
that EchoGen achieves subject fidelity and image quality comparable to
state-of-the-art diffusion-based methods with significantly lower sampling
latency. Code and models will be released soon.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于Transformer的时间序列预测方法使用时间无关的固定分块策略，破坏了时间连贯性，分割了自然过渡点，削弱了表示学习能力。

Method: EntroPE包含两个核心模块：基于熵的动态分块器（EDP）使用信息论标准定位时间过渡点确定分块边界；自适应补丁编码器（APE）使用池化和交叉注意力捕获块内依赖关系生成固定大小的潜在表示。

Result: 在长期预测基准测试中，EntroPE在准确性和效率方面均有提升，证明了熵引导动态分块作为时间序列建模新范式的有效性。

Conclusion: 熵引导的动态分块方法能够有效保持时间结构，同时保留分块的计算优势，为时间序列建模提供了有前景的新方向。

Abstract: Transformer-based models have significantly advanced time series forecasting,
with patch-based input strategies offering efficiency and improved long-horizon
modeling. Yet, existing approaches rely on temporally-agnostic patch
construction, where arbitrary starting positions and fixed lengths fracture
temporal coherence by splitting natural transitions across boundaries. This
naive segmentation often disrupts short-term dependencies and weakens
representation learning. In response, we propose EntroPE (Entropy-Guided
Dynamic Patch Encoder), a novel, temporally informed framework that dynamically
detects transition points via conditional entropy and dynamically places patch
boundaries. This preserves temporal structure while retaining the computational
benefits of patching. EntroPE consists of two key modules, namely an
Entropy-based Dynamic Patcher (EDP) that applies information-theoretic criteria
to locate natural temporal shifts and determine patch boundaries, and an
Adaptive Patch Encoder (APE) that employs pooling and cross-attention to
capture intra-patch dependencies and produce fixed-size latent representations.
These embeddings are then processed by a global transformer to model
inter-patch dynamics. Experiments across long-term forecasting benchmarks
demonstrate that EntroPE improves both accuracy and efficiency, establishing
entropy-guided dynamic patching as a promising new paradigm for time series
modeling. Code is available at: https://github.com/Sachithx/EntroPE.

Abstract: The performance of deep neural networks is strongly influenced by the quality

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant
advances in visual understanding tasks. However, their capacity to comprehend
human-centric scenes has rarely been explored, primarily due to the absence of
comprehensive evaluation benchmarks that take into account both the
human-oriented granular level and higher-dimensional causal reasoning ability.
Such high-quality evaluation benchmarks face tough obstacles, given the
physical complexity of the human body and the difficulty of annotating granular
structures. In this paper, we propose Human-MME, a curated benchmark designed
to provide a more holistic evaluation of MLLMs in human-centric scene
understanding. Compared with other existing benchmarks, our work provides three
key features: 1. Diversity in human scene, spanning 4 primary visual domains
with 15 secondary domains and 43 sub-fields to ensure broad scenario coverage.
2. Progressive and diverse evaluation dimensions, evaluating the human-based
activities progressively from the human-oriented granular perception to the
higher-dimensional reasoning, consisting of eight dimensions with 19,945
real-world image question pairs and an evaluation suite. 3. High-quality
annotations with rich data paradigms, constructing the automated annotation
pipeline and human-annotation platform, supporting rigorous manual labeling to
facilitate precise and reliable model assessment. Our benchmark extends the
single-target understanding to the multi-person and multi-image mutual
understanding by constructing the choice, short-answer, grounding, ranking and
judgment question components, and complex questions of their combination. The
extensive experiments on 17 state-of-the-art MLLMs effectively expose the
limitations and guide future MLLMs research toward better human-centric image
understanding. All data and code are available at

### [91] [Beyond Overall Accuracy: Pose- and Occlusion-driven Fairness Analysis in Pedestrian Detection for Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26166)
*Mohammad Khoshkdahan,Arman Akbari,Arash Akbari,Xuan Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文系统评估了行人检测模型在姿态和遮挡方面的公平性问题，发现检测器对平行腿、直肘和侧向视角的行人存在偏见，且下半身关节遮挡对检测率的影响更大。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在自动驾驶中，行人检测的安全性至关重要，但公平性问题尚未得到充分研究。本文旨在探究行人姿态变化（腿部状态、肘部状态、身体朝向）和关节遮挡如何影响检测性能的公平性。

Method: 评估了5个行人专用检测器和3个通用模型在ECP-DP数据集上的表现，使用EOD指标量化公平性，并通过Z检验评估统计显著性和鲁棒性。

Result: 研究发现检测器对平行腿、直肘和侧向视角的行人存在偏见，下半身关节遮挡比上半身和头部遮挡对检测率的负面影响更大。Cascade R-CNN在整体漏检率和所有属性偏差方面表现最佳。

Conclusion: 这是首个针对自动驾驶行人检测的全面姿态和遮挡感知公平性评估，揭示了现有检测模型在公平性方面的局限性，为开发更公平的行人检测系统提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Pedestrian detection plays a critical role in autonomous driving (AD), where
ensuring safety and reliability is important. While many detection models aim
to reduce miss-rates and handle challenges such as occlusion and long-range
recognition, fairness remains an underexplored yet equally important concern.
In this work, we systematically investigate how variations in the pedestrian
pose -- including leg status, elbow status, and body orientation -- as well as
individual joint occlusions, affect detection performance. We evaluate five
pedestrian-specific detectors (F2DNet, MGAN, ALFNet, CSP, and Cascade R-CNN)
alongside three general-purpose models (YOLOv12 variants) on the EuroCity
Persons Dense Pose (ECP-DP) dataset. Fairness is quantified using the Equal
Opportunity Difference (EOD) metric across various confidence thresholds. To
assess statistical significance and robustness, we apply the Z-test. Our
findings highlight biases against pedestrians with parallel legs, straight
elbows, and lateral views. Occlusion of lower body joints has a more negative
impact on the detection rate compared to the upper body and head. Cascade R-CNN
achieves the lowest overall miss-rate and exhibits the smallest bias across all
attributes. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive pose-
and occlusion-aware fairness evaluation in pedestrian detection for AD.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AttriGen是一个用于细胞显微镜图像自动多属性标注的新框架，通过CNN和Vision Transformer的双模型架构，在细胞类型分类和多属性分类上达到94.62%的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决细胞显微镜图像中多属性分类研究不足的问题，相比传统的细胞类型分类，多属性标注更能增强模型可解释性。

Method: 使用双模型架构：CNN用于细胞类型分类，Vision Transformer用于多属性分类，基于PBC数据集（8种细胞类型）和WBCAtt数据集（11种形态属性）。

Result: 在多属性分类上达到94.62%的新基准准确率，显著提升模型可解释性，相比人工标注节省大量时间和成本。

Conclusion: AttriGen建立了新的多属性标注范式，可扩展到其他计算机视觉分类任务，有效自动化多属性标签的扩展。

Abstract: We introduce AttriGen, a novel framework for automated, fine-grained
multi-attribute annotation in computer vision, with a particular focus on cell
microscopy where multi-attribute classification remains underrepresented
compared to traditional cell type categorization. Using two complementary
datasets: the Peripheral Blood Cell (PBC) dataset containing eight distinct
cell types and the WBC Attribute Dataset (WBCAtt) that contains their
corresponding 11 morphological attributes, we propose a dual-model architecture
that combines a CNN for cell type classification, as well as a Vision
Transformer (ViT) for multi-attribute classification achieving a new benchmark
of 94.62\% accuracy. Our experiments demonstrate that AttriGen significantly
enhances model interpretability and offers substantial time and cost efficiency
relative to conventional full-scale human annotation. Thus, our framework
establishes a new paradigm that can be extended to other computer vision
classification tasks by effectively automating the expansion of multi-attribute
labels.

Abstract: In this paper, we deal with the task of text-driven saliency detection in
360-degrees videos. For this, we introduce the TSV360 dataset which includes
16,000 triplets of ERP frames, textual descriptions of salient objects/events
in these frames, and the associated ground-truth saliency maps. Following, we
extend and adapt a SOTA visual-based approach for 360-degrees video saliency
detection, and develop the TSalV360 method that takes into account a
user-provided text description of the desired objects and/or events. This
method leverages a SOTA vision-language model for data representation and
integrates a similarity estimation module and a viewport spatio-temporal
cross-attention mechanism, to discover dependencies between the different data
modalities. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations using the TSV360 dataset,
showed the competitiveness of TSalV360 compared to a SOTA visual-based approach
and documented its competency to perform customized text-driven saliency
detection in 360-degrees videos.

TL;DR: 提出GSDD方法，使用2D高斯函数的稀疏表示进行数据集蒸馏，替代传统密集像素表示，在相同存储预算下提高数据集多样性和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统数据集蒸馏方法使用密集像素级表示，存在冗余且难以扩展，需要更高效的表示方法来降低计算和存储负担。

Method: 基于2D高斯函数的稀疏表示，仅用少量高斯基元编码关键判别信息，采用CUDA-based splatting算子实现并行推理和训练。

Result: 在CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100和ImageNet子集上达到最先进性能，同时保持高效的编码和解码成本。

Conclusion: GSDD是一种简单有效、广泛适用且高度可扩展的数据集蒸馏方法，通过稀疏表示显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Dataset distillation has emerged as a promising paradigm that synthesizes
compact, informative datasets capable of retaining the knowledge of large-scale
counterparts, thereby addressing the substantial computational and storage
burdens of modern model training. Conventional approaches typically rely on
dense pixel-level representations, which introduce redundancy and are difficult
to scale up. In this work, we propose GSDD, a novel and efficient sparse
representation for dataset distillation based on 2D Gaussians. Instead of
representing all pixels equally, GSDD encodes critical discriminative
information in a distilled image using only a small number of Gaussian
primitives. This sparse representation could improve dataset diversity under
the same storage budget, enhancing coverage of difficult samples and boosting
distillation performance. To ensure both efficiency and scalability, we adapt
CUDA-based splatting operators for parallel inference and training, enabling
high-quality rendering with minimal computational and memory overhead. Our
method is simple yet effective, broadly applicable to different distillation
pipelines, and highly scalable. Experiments show that GSDD achieves
state-of-the-art performance on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet subsets,
while remaining highly efficient encoding and decoding cost. Our code is

Abstract: In this paper, we present our experimental study on generating plausible
textual explanations for the outcomes of video summarization. For the needs of
this study, we extend an existing framework for multigranular explanation of
video summarization by integrating a SOTA Large Multimodal Model
(LLaVA-OneVision) and prompting it to produce natural language descriptions of
the obtained visual explanations. Following, we focus on one of the most
desired characteristics for explainable AI, the plausibility of the obtained
explanations that relates with their alignment with the humans' reasoning and
expectations. Using the extended framework, we propose an approach for
evaluating the plausibility of visual explanations by quantifying the semantic
overlap between their textual descriptions and the textual descriptions of the
corresponding video summaries, with the help of two methods for creating
sentence embeddings (SBERT, SimCSE). Based on the extended framework and the
proposed plausibility evaluation approach, we conduct an experimental study
using a SOTA method (CA-SUM) and two datasets (SumMe, TVSum) for video
summarization, to examine whether the more faithful explanations are also the
more plausible ones, and identify the most appropriate approach for generating
plausible textual explanations for video summarization.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了多粒度概念专家（MGCE）框架，通过动态概念对比学习和多粒度专家协作学习，解决广义类别发现中多粒度概念利用不足和类别数量未知的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有广义类别发现方法存在两个主要局限：未能充分利用视觉数据中的多粒度概念信息，以及假设未标注数据的类别数量已知，这在现实场景中不切实际。

Method: MGCE包含两个模块：动态概念对比学习（DCCL）交替进行概念挖掘和双层次表示学习；多粒度专家协作学习（MECL）引入不同粒度的专家并使用概念对齐矩阵实现跨专家协作。

Result: 在九个细粒度视觉识别基准测试中，MGCE取得了最先进的结果，特别是在新类别准确率方面。即使不知道类别数量，MGCE也优于需要知道确切类别数量的参数化方法，平均提升3.6%。

Conclusion: MGCE能够自动估计未标注数据中的类别数量，适合实际开放世界设置，在广义类别发现任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) is an open-world problem that clusters
unlabeled data by leveraging knowledge from partially labeled categories. A key
challenge is that unlabeled data may contain both known and novel categories.
Existing approaches suffer from two main limitations. First, they fail to
exploit multi-granularity conceptual information in visual data, which limits
representation quality. Second, most assume that the number of unlabeled
categories is known during training, which is impractical in real-world
scenarios. To address these issues, we propose a Multi-Granularity Conceptual
Experts (MGCE) framework that adaptively mines visual concepts and integrates
multi-granularity knowledge for accurate category discovery. MGCE consists of
two modules: (1) Dynamic Conceptual Contrastive Learning (DCCL), which
alternates between concept mining and dual-level representation learning to
jointly optimize feature learning and category discovery; and (2)
Multi-Granularity Experts Collaborative Learning (MECL), which extends the
single-expert paradigm by introducing additional experts at different
granularities and by employing a concept alignment matrix for effective
cross-expert collaboration. Importantly, MGCE can automatically estimate the
number of categories in unlabeled data, making it suitable for practical
open-world settings. Extensive experiments on nine fine-grained visual
recognition benchmarks demonstrate that MGCE achieves state-of-the-art results,
particularly in novel-class accuracy. Notably, even without prior knowledge of
category numbers, MGCE outperforms parametric approaches that require knowing
the exact number of categories, with an average improvement of 3.6\%. Code is
available at https://github.com/HaiyangZheng/MGCE.

Motivation: 解决扩散模型生成图像与输入提示之间精确对齐的挑战，现有方法存在数据有限、编辑操作可能损害图像质量等问题。

Method: 使用多模态大语言模型识别错位，引入隐式对齐器操作扩散条件特征，制定可训练的迭代更新偏好目标。

Result: 在SDXL、SDXL-DPO和FLUX上的评估显示IMG优于现有对齐方法，并能作为即插即用适配器增强现有微调方法。

Conclusion: IMG提供了一种有效且灵活的多模态对齐解决方案，无需额外数据或编辑操作即可显著提升图像与提示的对齐质量。

Abstract: Ensuring precise multimodal alignment between diffusion-generated images and
input prompts has been a long-standing challenge. Earlier works finetune
diffusion weight using high-quality preference data, which tends to be limited
and difficult to scale up. Recent editing-based methods further refine local
regions of generated images but may compromise overall image quality. In this
work, we propose Implicit Multimodal Guidance (IMG), a novel
re-generation-based multimodal alignment framework that requires no extra data
or editing operations. Specifically, given a generated image and its prompt,
IMG a) utilizes a multimodal large language model (MLLM) to identify
misalignments; b) introduces an Implicit Aligner that manipulates diffusion
conditioning features to reduce misalignments and enable re-generation; and c)
formulates the re-alignment goal into a trainable objective, namely Iteratively
Updated Preference Objective. Extensive qualitative and quantitative
evaluations on SDXL, SDXL-DPO, and FLUX show that IMG outperforms existing
alignment methods. Furthermore, IMG acts as a flexible plug-and-play adapter,
seamlessly enhancing prior finetuning-based alignment methods. Our code will be
available at https://github.com/SHI-Labs/IMG-Multimodal-Diffusion-Alignment.

Method: 利用机制可解释性分析内部计算，识别关键子组件，通过知识蒸馏训练紧凑学生模型，进行网络剪枝和重参数化。

Result: 开发的Donut-MINT模型在DocVQA基准测试中保持强劲性能，同时显著降低推理时间和内存使用。

Conclusion: 该方法将模型压缩重新定义为电路发现，连接了可解释性研究和实际视觉语言模型部署。

Abstract: Recent advances in Visually-rich Document Understanding rely on large
Vision-Language Models like Donut, which perform document-level Visual Question
Answering without Optical Character Recognition. Despite their effectiveness,
these models are too costly for real-time or resource-constrained applications.
We investigate model compression through knowledge distillation, training
compact student models from a larger teacher. We leverage mechanistic
interpretability to drive student architecture design within this framework. By
analyzing internal computations, we identify essential subcomponents to retain,
while having a clear view of which subcomponents should be approximated,
skipped, or reparametrized based on their function. This approach yields
Donut-MINT (Mechanistic Interpretability-based Network Trimming), a pruned
Donut variant that reduces inference time and memory usage while maintaining
strong performance on DocVQA, a standard benchmark for document Visual Question
Answering. Our method reframes compression as circuit discovery, bridging
interpretability research and practical Vision-Language Model deployment.

Motivation: 现有潜在动作模型存在两个瓶颈：端到端训练的视觉编码器空间理解能力差，以及输入帧间隔较大时模型脆弱导致时间感知有限，这阻碍了稳定清晰的动作建模。

Method: 提出Farsighted-LAM框架，包含几何感知空间编码和多尺度时间建模，从连续帧中捕捉结构先验和动态运动模式。进一步构建SSM-VLA端到端框架，集成结构化感知和视觉思维链模块来显式推理环境动态。

Result: 在仿真和真实世界的多个VLA任务上验证SSM-VLA，实现了最先进的性能表现。

Conclusion: 结合几何感知建模、时间一致性和显式推理的策略能有效增强具身智能的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Latent Action Models (LAMs) enable Vision-Language-Action (VLA) systems to
learn semantic action representations from large-scale unannotated data. Yet,
we identify two bottlenecks of LAMs: 1) the commonly adopted end-to-end trained
image encoder suffers from poor spatial understanding; 2) LAMs can be fragile
when input frames are distant, leading to limited temporal perception. Such
factors inevitably hinder stable and clear action modeling. To this end, we
propose Farsighted-LAM, a latent action framework with geometry-aware spatial
encoding and multi-scale temporal modeling, capturing structural priors and
dynamic motion patterns from consecutive frames. We further propose SSM-VLA, an
end-to-end VLA framework built upon Farsighted-LAM, which integrates structured
perception with a visual Chain-of-Thought module to explicitly reason about
environmental dynamics, enhancing decision consistency and interpretability. We
validate SSM-VLA on multiple VLA tasks in both simulation and real-world
settings, and achieve state-of-the-art performance. Our results demonstrate
that our strategy of combining geometry-aware modeling, temporal coherence, and
explicit reasoning is effective in enhancing the robustness and
generalizability of embodied intelligence.

Motivation: 合成媒体的快速发展使深度伪造检测成为在线安全和信任的关键挑战，但现有方法受限于数据集稀缺，且多模态大语言模型在深度伪造检测中表现不佳，常产生与视觉证据不符或幻觉的解释。

Method: 引入推理标注的深度伪造检测数据集，并提出段落级相对策略优化（PRPO）强化学习算法，在段落级别对齐LLM推理与图像内容。

Result: 实验显示PRPO大幅提升检测准确率，达到最高的推理分数4.55/5.0，消融研究进一步表明PRPO在测试条件下显著优于GRPO。

Conclusion: 结果表明，将多模态推理基于视觉证据对于实现更可靠和可解释的深度伪造检测至关重要。

Abstract: The rapid rise of synthetic media has made deepfake detection a critical
challenge for online safety and trust. Progress remains constrained by the
scarcity of large, high-quality datasets. Although multimodal large language
models (LLMs) exhibit strong reasoning capabilities, their performance on
deepfake detection is poor, often producing explanations that are misaligned
with visual evidence or hallucinatory. To address this limitation, we introduce
a reasoning-annotated dataset for deepfake detection and propose
Paragraph-level Relative Policy Optimization (PRPO), a reinforcement learning
algorithm that aligns LLM reasoning with image content at the paragraph level.
Experiments show that PRPO improves detection accuracy by a wide margin and
achieves the highest reasoning score of 4.55/5.0. Ablation studies further
demonstrate that PRPO significantly outperforms GRPO under test-time
conditions. These results underscore the importance of grounding multimodal
reasoning in visual evidence to enable more reliable and interpretable deepfake
detection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统仿射变换在低比特后训练量化中表现不佳，使用统一的仿射参数集会恶化结果，需要更精细的误差减少方法。

Method: 提出聚类仿射变换(CAT)框架，使用聚类特定参数来对齐低比特量化输出与全精度对应输出，仅需少量额外参数，无需微调模型或量化参数。

Result: 在ImageNet-1K上，该框架在多种架构和低比特设置下始终优于现有PTQ方法，W2A2 ResNet-18上达到53.18% Top-1准确率，作为插件可提升现有基线3%以上。

Conclusion: CAT是一种有效的误差减少框架，显著提升了低比特后训练量化的性能，且易于集成到现有方法中。

Abstract: Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) reduces the memory footprint and
computational overhead of deep neural networks by converting full-precision
(FP) values into quantized and compressed data types. While PTQ is more
cost-efficient than Quantization-Aware Training (QAT), it is highly susceptible
to accuracy degradation under a low-bit quantization (LQ) regime (e.g., 2-bit).
Affine transformation is a classical technique used to reduce the discrepancy
between the information processed by a quantized model and that processed by
its full-precision counterpart; however, we find that using plain affine
transformation, which applies a uniform affine parameter set for all outputs,
worsens the results in low-bit PTQ. To address this, we propose Cluster-based
Affine Transformation (CAT), an error-reduction framework that employs
cluster-specific parameters to align LQ outputs with FP counterparts. CAT
refines LQ outputs with only a negligible number of additional parameters,
without requiring fine-tuning of the model or quantization parameters. We
further introduce a novel PTQ framework integrated with CAT. Experiments on
ImageNet-1K show that this framework consistently outperforms prior PTQ methods
across diverse architectures and LQ settings, achieving up to 53.18% Top-1
accuracy on W2A2 ResNet-18. Moreover, CAT enhances existing PTQ baselines by
more than 3% when used as a plug-in. We plan to release our implementation
alongside the publication of this paper.

Abstract: Existing approaches to skill proficiency estimation often rely on black-box
video classifiers, ignoring multi-view context and lacking explainability. We
present ProfVLM, a compact vision-language model that reformulates this task as
generative reasoning: it jointly predicts skill level and generates expert-like
feedback from egocentric and exocentric videos. Central to our method is an
AttentiveGatedProjector that dynamically fuses multi-view features, projected
from a frozen TimeSformer backbone into a language model tuned for feedback
generation. Trained on EgoExo4D with expert commentaries, ProfVLM surpasses
state-of-the-art methods while using up to 20x fewer parameters and reducing
training time by up to 60%. Our approach not only achieves superior accuracy
across diverse activities, but also outputs natural language critiques aligned
with performance, offering transparent reasoning. These results highlight

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的点监督方法存在两个缺陷：伪标签利用率低和伪标签质量差，这限制了定向目标检测的性能。

Method: 1) 渐进式标签分配(PLA)：在不同训练阶段动态估计实例大小，实现标签分配方法的使用。2) 先验引导动态掩码损失(PGDM-Loss)：结合SAM模型和分水岭算法的优势，克服了稀疏场景和密集场景中的性能问题。

Result: 在多个数据集上取得了竞争性性能：DOTA-v1.0(66.09%)、DOTA-v1.5(56.86%)、DOTA-v2.0(41.28%)、DIOR(46.40%)、STAR(19.60%)、RSAR(45.96%)，特别在物体尺寸变化大或稀疏场景中表现优异。

Conclusion: Point2RBox-v3是首个使用动态伪标签进行标签分配的模型，创新性地结合了SAM模型和分水岭算法的优势，在稀疏和密集场景中都能实现优秀性能。

Abstract: Driven by the growing need for Oriented Object Detection (OOD), learning from
point annotations under a weakly-supervised framework has emerged as a
promising alternative to costly and laborious manual labeling. In this paper,
we discuss two deficiencies in existing point-supervised methods: inefficient
utilization and poor quality of pseudo labels. Therefore, we present
Point2RBox-v3. At the core are two principles: 1) Progressive Label Assignment
(PLA). It dynamically estimates instance sizes in a coarse yet intelligent
manner at different stages of the training process, enabling the use of label
assignment methods. 2) Prior-Guided Dynamic Mask Loss (PGDM-Loss). It is an
enhancement of the Voronoi Watershed Loss from Point2RBox-v2, which overcomes
the shortcomings of Watershed in its poor performance in sparse scenes and
SAM's poor performance in dense scenes. To our knowledge, Point2RBox-v3 is the
first model to employ dynamic pseudo labels for label assignment, and it
creatively complements the advantages of SAM model with the watershed
algorithm, which achieves excellent performance in both sparse and dense
scenes. Our solution gives competitive performance, especially in scenarios
with large variations in object size or sparse object occurrences:
66.09%/56.86%/41.28%/46.40%/19.60%/45.96% on
DOTA-v1.0/DOTA-v1.5/DOTA-v2.0/DIOR/STAR/RSAR.

*Mehrsa Pourya,Bassam El Rawas,Michael Unser*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Flower是一种用于逆问题的求解器，利用预训练的流模型生成与观测测量一致的复原结果。它通过三个步骤的迭代过程工作：流一致的目标估计、精炼步骤和时间推进步骤。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 统一基于插拔式方法和生成式逆求解器的视角，提供近似贝叶斯后验采样的理论分析，同时在不同逆问题上使用几乎相同的超参数实现最先进的复原质量。

Method: Flower采用三步迭代过程：(i)流一致目标估计：速度网络预测去噪目标；(ii)精炼步骤：将估计目标投影到由前向算子定义的可行集；(iii)时间推进步骤：沿流轨迹重新投影精炼后的目标。

Result: Flower在多个逆问题上实现了最先进的复原质量，同时在不同问题间使用几乎相同的超参数。

Conclusion: Flower通过统一插拔式方法和生成式逆求解器的视角，提供了一种有效的逆问题求解框架，具有理论保证和实际应用的优越性能。

Abstract: We introduce Flower, a solver for inverse problems. It leverages a
pre-trained flow model to produce reconstructions that are consistent with the
observed measurements. Flower operates through an iterative procedure over
three steps: (i) a flow-consistent destination estimation, where the velocity
network predicts a denoised target; (ii) a refinement step that projects the
estimated destination onto a feasible set defined by the forward operator; and
(iii) a time-progression step that re-projects the refined destination along
the flow trajectory. We provide a theoretical analysis that demonstrates how
Flower approximates Bayesian posterior sampling, thereby unifying perspectives
from plug-and-play methods and generative inverse solvers. On the practical
side, Flower achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction quality while using
nearly identical hyperparameters across various inverse problems.

### [105] [Continuous Space-Time Video Super-Resolution with 3D Fourier Fields](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26325)
*Alexander Becker,Julius Erbach,Dominik Narnhofer,Konrad Schindler*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种连续时空视频超分辨率的新方法——3D视频傅里叶场(VFF)，通过傅里叶基函数表示视频，支持任意时空位置的灵活采样，在多个基准测试中达到最先进水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法将视频分解为空间和时间分量，依赖脆弱的显式帧扭曲进行运动补偿，存在局限性。需要一种能够同时捕捉精细空间细节和平滑时间动态的连续表示方法。

Method: 使用3D视频傅里叶场表示视频，通过神经网络编码器预测傅里叶基系数，支持任意时空位置的采样，并可包含高斯点扩散函数来确保无混叠重建。

Result: 在多个基准测试中达到最先进水平，相比现有基线方法，在广泛的放大因子范围内提供更清晰、时间更一致的重建结果，同时计算效率更高。

Conclusion: 联合建模方法显著改善了空间和时间超分辨率性能，3D视频傅里叶场表示为连续时空视频处理提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce a novel formulation for continuous space-time video
super-resolution. Instead of decoupling the representation of a video sequence
into separate spatial and temporal components and relying on brittle, explicit
frame warping for motion compensation, we encode video as a continuous,
spatio-temporally coherent 3D Video Fourier Field (VFF). That representation
offers three key advantages: (1) it enables cheap, flexible sampling at
arbitrary locations in space and time; (2) it is able to simultaneously capture
fine spatial detail and smooth temporal dynamics; and (3) it offers the
possibility to include an analytical, Gaussian point spread function in the
sampling to ensure aliasing-free reconstruction at arbitrary scale. The
coefficients of the proposed, Fourier-like sinusoidal basis are predicted with
a neural encoder with a large spatio-temporal receptive field, conditioned on
the low-resolution input video. Through extensive experiments, we show that our
joint modeling substantially improves both spatial and temporal
super-resolution and sets a new state of the art for multiple benchmarks:
across a wide range of upscaling factors, it delivers sharper and temporally
more consistent reconstructions than existing baselines, while being
computationally more efficient. Project page: https://v3vsr.github.io.

*Keming Wu,Sicong Jiang,Max Ku,Ping Nie,Minghao Liu,Wenhu Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一个名为\mname的奖励模型，通过大规模人类偏好数据集训练，解决了开源图像编辑模型缺乏可靠奖励模型的问题，在多个基准测试中达到最先进水平，并能用于筛选高质量训练数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开源图像编辑模型因缺乏可靠的奖励模型而落后于闭源模型，这限制了高质量合成训练数据的扩展。

Method: 构建了包含20万对偏好数据的大规模人类偏好数据集，由训练有素的专家按照严格协议标注，并基于此训练\mname奖励模型。

Result: \mname在多个基准测试中达到最先进的人类相关性，能有效筛选高质量训练数据，训练出的Step1X-Edit模型相比全数据集训练有显著提升。

Conclusion: \mname作为奖励模型能有效扩展高质量图像编辑训练数据，具有强化学习后训练和测试时扩展等高级应用潜力，将开源以帮助社区构建更多高质量数据集。

Abstract: Recently, we have witnessed great progress in image editing with natural
language instructions. Several closed-source models like GPT-Image-1, Seedream,
and Google-Nano-Banana have shown highly promising progress. However, the
open-source models are still lagging. The main bottleneck is the lack of a
reliable reward model to scale up high-quality synthetic training data. To
address this critical bottleneck, we built \mname, trained with our new
large-scale human preference dataset, meticulously annotated by trained experts
following a rigorous protocol containing over 200K preference pairs. \mname
demonstrates superior alignment with human preferences in instruction-guided
image editing tasks. Experiments show that \mname achieves state-of-the-art
human correlation on established benchmarks such as GenAI-Bench, AURORA-Bench,
ImagenHub, and our new \benchname, outperforming a wide range of VLM-as-judge
models. Furthermore, we use \mname to select a high-quality subset from the
existing noisy ShareGPT-4o-Image dataset. We train Step1X-Edit on the selected
subset, which shows significant improvement over training on the full set. This
demonstrates \mname's ability to serve as a reward model to scale up
high-quality training data for image editing. Furthermore, its strong alignment
suggests potential for advanced applications like reinforcement learning-based
post-training and test-time scaling of image editing models. \mname with its
training dataset will be released to help the community build more high-quality
image editing training datasets.

### [107] [TimeScope: Towards Task-Oriented Temporal Grounding In Long Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26360)
*Xiangrui Liu,Minghao Qin,Yan Shu,Zhengyang Liang,Yang Tian,Chen Jason Zhang,Bo Zhao,Zheng Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Task-oriented Temporal Grounding (ToTG)新问题，旨在根据任务描述定位长视频中的关键时间区间，并构建了ToTG Bench基准和TimeScope框架来解决该问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 识别长视频中的关键时刻对于下游理解和推理任务至关重要，但传统方法由于泛化能力有限和处理长视频困难而面临挑战。

Method: 提出TimeScope框架，基于渐进推理：首先在长视频中识别可能包含关键时刻的粗粒度时间范围，然后通过细粒度时刻划分来精炼这个范围。还构建了ToTG Pile数据集来增强渐进时间定位能力。

Result: 大量实验表明，TimeScope在各种设置下始终优于现有的时间定位方法和流行的多模态大语言模型。

Conclusion: TimeScope在解决这一新的具有挑战性的问题上表现出色，证明了其有效性。

Abstract: Identifying key moments in long videos is essential for downstream
understanding and reasoning tasks. In this paper, we introduce a new problem,
Taskoriented Temporal Grounding ToTG, which aims to localize time intervals
containing the necessary information based on a task's natural description.
Along with the definition, we also present ToTG Bench, a comprehensive
benchmark for evaluating the performance on ToTG. ToTG is particularly
challenging for traditional approaches due to their limited generalizability
and difficulty in handling long videos. To address these challenges, we propose
TimeScope, a novel framework built upon progressive reasoning. TimeScope first
identifies a coarse-grained temporal scope in the long video that likely
contains the key moments, and then refines this scope through finegrained
moment partitioning. Additionally, we curate a highquality dataset, namely ToTG
Pile, to enhance TimeScope's ability to perform progressive temporal grounding
effectively. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TimeScope consistently
outperforms both existing temporalgrounding methods and popular MLLMs across
various settings, highlighting its effectiveness in addressing this new
challenging problem.

### [108] [Go with Your Gut: Scaling Confidence for Autoregressive Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26376)
*Harold Haodong Chen,Xianfeng Wu,Wen-Jie Shu,Rongjin Guo,Disen Lan,Harry Yang,Ying-Cong Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ScalingAR是首个专为基于下一个token预测的自回归图像生成设计的测试时缩放框架，无需早期解码或辅助奖励，通过token熵作为新信号，在两个互补级别进行缩放，显著提升生成质量和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的测试时缩放方法依赖于频繁的部分解码和外部奖励模型，不适用于基于下一个token预测的自回归图像生成，因为中间解码结果本质上不完整。需要专门解决这一问题的框架。

Method: ScalingAR利用token熵作为视觉token生成的新信号，在配置文件级别融合内在和条件信号来流式传输校准的置信状态，在策略级别利用该状态自适应终止低置信度轨迹并动态调度指导以调整条件强度。

Result: 在通用和组合基准测试中，ScalingAR将基础模型在GenEval上提升12.5%，在TIIF-Bench上提升15.2%；有效减少62.0%的视觉token消耗同时超越基线；增强鲁棒性，在挑战性场景中缓解26.0%的性能下降。

Conclusion: ScalingAR成功为基于下一个token预测的自回归图像生成提供了有效的测试时缩放解决方案，显著提升了生成质量、效率和鲁棒性，无需依赖早期解码或外部奖励模型。

Abstract: Test-time scaling (TTS) has demonstrated remarkable success in enhancing
large language models, yet its application to next-token prediction (NTP)
autoregressive (AR) image generation remains largely uncharted. Existing TTS
approaches for visual AR (VAR), which rely on frequent partial decoding and
external reward models, are ill-suited for NTP-based image generation due to
the inherent incompleteness of intermediate decoding results. To bridge this
gap, we introduce ScalingAR, the first TTS framework specifically designed for
NTP-based AR image generation that eliminates the need for early decoding or
auxiliary rewards. ScalingAR leverages token entropy as a novel signal in
visual token generation and operates at two complementary scaling levels: (i)
Profile Level, which streams a calibrated confidence state by fusing intrinsic
and conditional signals; and (ii) Policy Level, which utilizes this state to
adaptively terminate low-confidence trajectories and dynamically schedule
guidance for phase-appropriate conditioning strength. Experiments on both
general and compositional benchmarks show that ScalingAR (1) improves base
models by 12.5% on GenEval and 15.2% on TIIF-Bench, (2) efficiently reduces
visual token consumption by 62.0% while outperforming baselines, and (3)
successfully enhances robustness, mitigating performance drops by 26.0% in
challenging scenarios.

### [109] [PANDA: Towards Generalist Video Anomaly Detection via Agentic AI Engineer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26386)
*Zhiwei Yang,Chen Gao,Mike Zheng Shou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了PANDA，一种基于多模态大语言模型的智能AI工程师，用于视频异常检测，能够在无需训练数据或人工干预的情况下自动处理任何场景和异常类型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统视频异常检测方法依赖领域特定训练数据、需要手动调整、泛化能力有限的问题，实现通用的异常检测。

Method: 开发了四种关键能力：自适应的场景感知策略规划、目标驱动的启发式推理、工具增强的自我反思、自我改进的记忆链机制，包括场景感知RAG、潜在异常引导的启发式提示策略、渐进式反思机制和记忆链机制。

Result: 在多种场景、开放集和复杂场景设置中实现了最先进的性能，无需训练和人工参与，验证了其可泛化和鲁棒的异常检测能力。

Conclusion: PANDA通过智能AI工程师方法成功实现了通用的视频异常检测，为复杂现实场景中的异常检测提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Video anomaly detection (VAD) is a critical yet challenging task due to the
complex and diverse nature of real-world scenarios. Previous methods typically
rely on domain-specific training data and manual adjustments when applying to
new scenarios and unseen anomaly types, suffering from high labor costs and
limited generalization. Therefore, we aim to achieve generalist VAD, i.e.,
automatically handle any scene and any anomaly types without training data or
human involvement. In this work, we propose PANDA, an agentic AI engineer based
on MLLMs. Specifically, we achieve PANDA by comprehensively devising four key
capabilities: (1) self-adaptive scene-aware strategy planning, (2) goal-driven
heuristic reasoning, (3) tool-augmented self-reflection, and (4) self-improving
chain-of-memory. Concretely, we develop a self-adaptive scene-aware RAG
mechanism, enabling PANDA to retrieve anomaly-specific knowledge for anomaly
detection strategy planning. Next, we introduce a latent anomaly-guided
heuristic prompt strategy to enhance reasoning precision. Furthermore, PANDA
employs a progressive reflection mechanism alongside a suite of context-aware
tools to iteratively refine decision-making in complex scenarios. Finally, a
chain-of-memory mechanism enables PANDA to leverage historical experiences for
continual performance improvement. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PANDA
achieves state-of-the-art performance in multi-scenario, open-set, and complex
scenario settings without training and manual involvement, validating its
generalizable and robust anomaly detection capability. Code is released at

*Chenhui Zhu,Yilu Wu,Shuai Wang,Gangshan Wu,Limin Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MotionRAG是一个检索增强框架，通过从相关参考视频中提取运动先验来提升图像到视频生成的动态真实感，采用上下文感知运动适应技术，在推理时计算开销可忽略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于扩散模型的图像到视频生成在生成真实运动方面仍面临挑战，因为准确建模运动需要捕捉物理约束、物体交互和特定领域动态，这些难以在不同场景中泛化。

Method: 提出MotionRAG框架：1）基于检索的流程提取高级运动特征；2）通过因果Transformer架构实现上下文学习进行运动适应；3）基于注意力的运动注入适配器将转移的运动特征无缝集成到预训练视频扩散模型中。

Result: 广泛实验表明，该方法在多个领域和各种基础模型上均取得显著改进，推理时计算开销可忽略，模块化设计支持通过更新检索数据库实现对新领域的零样本泛化。

Conclusion: 该研究通过有效检索和转移运动先验，增强了视频生成系统的核心能力，促进了真实运动动态的合成。

Abstract: Image-to-video generation has made remarkable progress with the advancements
in diffusion models, yet generating videos with realistic motion remains highly
challenging. This difficulty arises from the complexity of accurately modeling
motion, which involves capturing physical constraints, object interactions, and
domain-specific dynamics that are not easily generalized across diverse
scenarios. To address this, we propose MotionRAG, a retrieval-augmented
framework that enhances motion realism by adapting motion priors from relevant
reference videos through Context-Aware Motion Adaptation (CAMA). The key
technical innovations include: (i) a retrieval-based pipeline extracting
high-level motion features using video encoder and specialized resamplers to
distill semantic motion representations; (ii) an in-context learning approach
for motion adaptation implemented through a causal transformer architecture;
(iii) an attention-based motion injection adapter that seamlessly integrates
transferred motion features into pretrained video diffusion models. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method achieves significant improvements
across multiple domains and various base models, all with negligible
computational overhead during inference. Furthermore, our modular design
enables zero-shot generalization to new domains by simply updating the
retrieval database without retraining any components. This research enhances
the core capability of video generation systems by enabling the effective
retrieval and transfer of motion priors, facilitating the synthesis of
realistic motion dynamics.

*Atakan Topaloglu,Ahmet Bilican,Cansu Korkmaz,A. Murat Tekalp*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于图像难度感知的超分辨率模型评估方法，通过高频指数和旋转不变边缘指数来预测模型在不同难度图像上的表现差异，解决了传统平均评分无法反映模型在困难图像上性能的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统超分辨率模型评估使用平均评分方法，无法反映模型在不同难度图像上的性能差异，特别是某些模型在困难图像上会产生伪影但平均得分仍然接近的问题。

Method: 提出了两种图像难度度量指标：高频指数和旋转不变边缘指数，用于预测测试图像中模型之间视觉结果差异显著的情况，并设计了相应的评估方法将这些视觉差异反映在客观指标上。

Result: 实验结果表明，所提出的图像难度度量和评估方法能够有效区分在平均性能得分接近但视觉结果不同的超分辨率模型。

Conclusion: 提出的难度感知性能评估程序能够更好地区分产生不同视觉结果的超分辨率模型，特别是在传统平均评分方法无法有效区分的场景下。

Abstract: Image super-resolution models are commonly evaluated by average scores (over
some benchmark test sets), which fail to reflect the performance of these
models on images of varying difficulty and that some models generate artifacts
on certain difficult images, which is not reflected by the average scores. We
propose difficulty-aware performance evaluation procedures to better
differentiate between SISR models that produce visually different results on
some images but yield close average performance scores over the entire test
set. In particular, we propose two image-difficulty measures, the
high-frequency index and rotation-invariant edge index, to predict those test
images, where a model would yield significantly better visual results over
another model, and an evaluation method where these visual differences are
reflected on objective measures. Experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed image-difficulty measures and evaluation
methodology.

*Pengze Xue,Shanwen Wang,Fei Zhou,Yan Cui,Xin Sun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了PRISM框架，一个渐进式三阶段图像去雨方法，结合多尺度特征聚合和混合域建模，在多个数据集上取得竞争性结果


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前单尺度模型在细粒度恢复和全局一致性方面存在困难，需要更有效的去雨方法

Method: 三阶段框架：粗提取网络(CENet)、频率融合网络(SFNet)和细化网络(RNet)，使用混合注意力UNet和混合域Mamba进行多尺度特征聚合和空间语义建模

Result: 在多个数据集上取得了竞争性结果，能够学习高频雨特征同时保持结构细节和全局上下文

Conclusion: PRISM框架通过渐进式三阶段处理有效提升了图像去雨的质量和一致性

Abstract: Image deraining is an essential vision technique that removes rain streaks
and water droplets, enhancing clarity for critical vision tasks like autonomous
driving. However, current single-scale models struggle with fine-grained
recovery and global consistency. To address this challenge, we propose
Progressive Rain removal with Integrated State-space Modeling (PRISM), a
progressive three-stage framework: Coarse Extraction Network (CENet), Frequency
Fusion Network (SFNet), and Refine Network (RNet). Specifically, CENet and
SFNet utilize a novel Hybrid Attention UNet (HA-UNet) for multi-scale feature
aggregation by combining channel attention with windowed spatial transformers.
Moreover, we propose Hybrid Domain Mamba (HDMamba) for SFNet to jointly model
spatial semantics and wavelet domain characteristics. Finally, RNet recovers
the fine-grained structures via an original-resolution subnetwork. Our model
learns high-frequency rain characteristics while preserving structural details
and maintaining global context, leading to improved image quality. Our method
achieves competitive results on multiple datasets against recent deraining
methods.

*Donghoon Kim,Dongyoung Lee,Ik Joon Chang,Sung-Ho Bae*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出QuaRTZ方法，通过残差截断和零抑制实现扩散模型的4位量化，在保持纹理细节的同时减少计算需求


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型虽然能生成高质量图像，但计算需求高难以部署。现有的8位量化方法效果不错，但扩展到4位量化时，由于步长增大导致密集低幅值激活的舍入误差放大，丢失纹理细节

Method: QuaRTZ方法：使用8位最小-最大量化处理异常值，然后通过前导零抑制压缩到4位以保留最低有效位(LSB)，从而保持纹理细节

Result: 4位QuaRTZ在FLUX.1-schnell上达到FID 6.98，优于需要辅助FP16分支的SVDQuant方法

Conclusion: QuaRTZ通过平衡异常值保留和LSB精度，有效减少了舍入误差并提高了量化效率，理论推导和实证评估都证明了该方法在不同激活分布上的通用性

Abstract: Diffusion models achieve high-quality image generation but face deployment
challenges due to their high computational requirements. Although 8-bit
outlier-aware post-training quantization (PTQ) matches full-precision
performance, extending PTQ to 4 bits remains challenging. Larger step sizes in
4-bit quantization amplify rounding errors in dense, low-magnitude activations,
leading to the loss of fine-grained textures. We hypothesize that not only
outliers but also small activations are critical for texture fidelity. To this
end, we propose Quantization via Residual Truncation and Zero Suppression
(QuaRTZ), a 4-bit PTQ scheme for diffusion models. QuaRTZ applies 8-bit min-max
quantization for outlier handling and compresses to 4 bits via leading-zero
suppression to retain LSBs, thereby preserving texture details. Our approach
reduces rounding errors and improves quantization efficiency by balancing
outlier preservation and LSB precision. Both theoretical derivations and
empirical evaluations demonstrate the generalizability of QuaRTZ across diverse
activation distributions. Notably, 4-bit QuaRTZ achieves an FID of 6.98 on
FLUX.1-schnell, outperforming SVDQuant that requires auxiliary FP16 branches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代生产线需要确保每辆车都符合正确的变体规格且无可见缺陷，这是一个日益复杂的挑战。

Method: 使用11个同步摄像头捕获车辆360度视图，将任务特定视图路由到专用模块：YOLOv8进行零件检测，EfficientNet进行ICE/EV分类，Gemini-1.5 Flash进行吉祥物OCR，YOLOv8-Seg进行划痕和凹陷分割。通过视图感知融合层标准化证据，VIN条件规则引擎将检测到的特征与预期清单进行比较。

Result: 在混合数据集上，AVI达到93%的验证准确率，86%的缺陷检测召回率，并维持每分钟3.3辆车的处理速度，大幅超越单视图或无分割基线。

Conclusion: 这是首个公开报道的系统，在可部署的工业汽车环境中统一了多摄像头特征验证与缺陷检测。

Abstract: Ensuring that every vehicle leaving a modern production line is built to the
correct \emph{variant} specification and is free from visible defects is an
increasingly complex challenge. We present the \textbf{Automated Vehicle
Inspection (AVI)} platform, an end-to-end, \emph{multi-view} perception system
that couples deep-learning detectors with a semantic rule engine to deliver
\emph{variant-aware} quality control in real time. Eleven synchronized cameras
capture a full 360{\deg} sweep of each vehicle; task-specific views are then
routed to specialised modules: YOLOv8 for part detection, EfficientNet for
ICE/EV classification, Gemini-1.5 Flash for mascot OCR, and YOLOv8-Seg for
scratch-and-dent segmentation. A view-aware fusion layer standardises evidence,
while a VIN-conditioned rule engine compares detected features against the
expected manifest, producing an interpretable pass/fail report in \(\approx\!
300\,\text{ms}\). On a mixed data set of Original Equipment Manufacturer(OEM)
vehicle data sets of four distinct models plus public scratch/dent images, AVI
achieves \textbf{ 93 \%} verification accuracy, \textbf{86 \%} defect-detection
recall, and sustains \(\mathbf{3.3}\) vehicles/min, surpassing single-view or
no segmentation baselines by large margins. To our knowledge, this is the first
publicly reported system that unifies multi-camera feature validation with
defect detection in a deployable automotive setting in industry.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Stylos是一个单次前向传播的3D高斯框架，用于从单张图像或多视角集合中实现3D风格迁移，无需逐场景优化或预计算姿态。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有3D风格迁移方法需要逐场景优化、预计算姿态以及难以保持几何一致性的问题。

Method: 采用Transformer架构，包含几何预测路径（自注意力保持几何保真度）和风格注入路径（全局交叉注意力确保视觉一致性），并引入基于体素的3D风格损失。

Result: 在多个数据集上实现了高质量的零样本风格化，能够泛化到未见过的类别、场景和风格。

Conclusion: Stylos通过全局风格-内容耦合、3D风格损失和可扩展框架，实现了几何感知、视角一致的3D风格迁移。

Abstract: We present Stylos, a single-forward 3D Gaussian framework for 3D style
transfer that operates on unposed content, from a single image to a multi-view
collection, conditioned on a separate reference style image. Stylos synthesizes
a stylized 3D Gaussian scene without per-scene optimization or precomputed
poses, achieving geometry-aware, view-consistent stylization that generalizes
to unseen categories, scenes, and styles. At its core, Stylos adopts a
Transformer backbone with two pathways: geometry predictions retain
self-attention to preserve geometric fidelity, while style is injected via
global cross-attention to enforce visual consistency across views. With the
addition of a voxel-based 3D style loss that aligns aggregated scene features
to style statistics, Stylos enforces view-consistent stylization while
preserving geometry. Experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate that
Stylos delivers high-quality zero-shot stylization, highlighting the
effectiveness of global style-content coupling, the proposed 3D style loss, and
the scalability of our framework from single view to large-scale multi-view
settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决室内场景分类的挑战性，特别是在敏感内容分析（如儿童性虐待图像分类）中需要隐私保护和可解释性

Method: 将图像转换为场景图，然后使用图注意力网络进行推理，直接建模场景组件之间的交互

Result: 在Places8数据集上达到81.27%的平衡准确率，超越基于图像的方法；在真实世界CSAI评估中获得74.27%的平衡准确率

Conclusion: 结构化场景表示是室内场景分类和CSAI分类的强大范式

Abstract: Indoor scene classification is a critical task in computer vision, with
wide-ranging applications that go from robotics to sensitive content analysis,
such as child sexual abuse imagery (CSAI) classification. The problem is
particularly challenging due to the intricate relationships between objects and
complex spatial layouts. In this work, we propose the Attention over Scene
Graphs for Sensitive Content Analysis (ASGRA), a novel framework that operates
on structured graph representations instead of raw pixels. By first converting
images into Scene Graphs and then employing a Graph Attention Network for
inference, ASGRA directly models the interactions between a scene's components.
This approach offers two key benefits: (i) inherent explainability via object
and relationship identification, and (ii) privacy preservation, enabling model
training without direct access to sensitive images. On Places8, we achieve
81.27% balanced accuracy, surpassing image-based methods. Real-world CSAI
evaluation with law enforcement yields 74.27% balanced accuracy. Our results
establish structured scene representations as a robust paradigm for indoor
scene classification and CSAI classification. Code is publicly available at

Abstract: Betel leaf is an important crop because of its economic advantages and
widespread use. Its betel vines are susceptible to a number of illnesses that
are commonly referred to as betel leaf disease. Plant diseases are the largest
threat to the food supply's security, and they are challenging to identify in
time to stop possible financial damage. Interestingly, artificial intelligence
can leave a big mark on the betel leaf industry since it helps with output
growth by forecasting sickness. This paper presents a lightweight CBAM-CNN
model with just 2.13 million parameters (8.13 MB), incorporating CBAM
(Convolutional Block Attention Module) to improve feature emphasis without
depending on heavy pre-trained networks. The model's capacity to discern minute
variations among leaf disease classes is improved by the integrated attention
mechanism, which allows it to adaptively focus on significant spatial and
channel-wise information. In order to ensure class balance and diversity for
efficient model training and validation, this work makes use of an enriched
dataset of 10,185 images divided into three categories: Healthy Leaf, Leaf Rot,
and Leaf Spot. The proposed model achieved a precision of 97%, recall of 94%,
and F1 score of 95%, and 95.58% accuracy on the test set demonstrating strong
and balanced classification performance outperforming traditional pre trained
CNN models. The model's focus regions were visualized and interpreted using
Grad-CAM (Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping), an explainable AI
technique.

TL;DR: 提出了一种从用户移动轨迹重建空间布局（如房屋平面图）的逆问题解决方案，使用扩散模型后验采样器，并通过对比学习在嵌入空间中重新定义似然分数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 直接从移动轨迹重建空间布局是病态问题，因为多个平面图可能解释相同的移动轨迹。现有方法面临路径规划过程不可逆、不可微导致的优化不稳定问题。

Method: 采用扩散模型后验采样器，在对比学习训练的嵌入空间中重新定义似然分数，使兼容的平面图和轨迹靠近，不匹配的远离，从而稳定优化过程。

Result: CoGuide模型在实验中比可微分规划器基线和引导扩散方法产生更一致的平面图，且更鲁棒。

Conclusion: 在嵌入空间中定义替代似然分数可以有效近似真实似然，指导去噪过程趋向后验分布，解决轨迹到平面图重建的逆问题。

Abstract: We consider the inverse problem of reconstructing the spatial layout of a
place, a home floorplan for example, from a user`s movements inside that
layout. Direct inversion is ill-posed since many floorplans can explain the
same movement trajectories. We adopt a diffusion-based posterior sampler to
generate layouts consistent with the measurements. While active research is in
progress on generative inverse solvers, we find that the forward operator in
our problem poses new challenges. The path-planning process inside a floorplan
is a non-invertible, non-differentiable function, and causes instability while
optimizing using the likelihood score. We break-away from existing approaches
and reformulate the likelihood score in a smoother embedding space. The
embedding space is trained with a contrastive loss which brings compatible
floorplans and trajectories close to each other, while pushing mismatched pairs
far apart. We show that a surrogate form of the likelihood score in this
embedding space is a valid approximation of the true likelihood score, making
it possible to steer the denoising process towards the posterior. Across
extensive experiments, our model CoGuide produces more consistent floorplans
from trajectories, and is more robust than differentiable-planner baselines and
guided-diffusion methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型计算成本高，不适合资源受限的边缘环境，而预训练后的小模型在复杂任务上表现不足，需要高效提升小模型性能。

Method: 采用课程式监督微调(SFT)和离线策略知识蒸馏的后训练流程，专门针对Ascend边缘设备优化。

Result: 生成的指令调优模型在十亿参数模型中达到最先进性能，在严格硬件约束下展现出强泛化能力，并在多种任务上保持竞争力。

Conclusion: 为在Ascend边缘设备上开发高性能语言模型提供了实用高效的解决方案。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has significantly
advanced the capabilities of artificial intelligence across various domains.
However, their massive scale and high computational costs render them
unsuitable for direct deployment in resource-constrained edge environments.
This creates a critical need for high-performance small models that can operate
efficiently at the edge. Yet, after pre-training alone, these smaller models
often fail to meet the performance requirements of complex tasks. To bridge
this gap, we introduce a systematic post-training pipeline that efficiently
enhances small model accuracy. Our post training pipeline consists of
curriculum-based supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and offline on-policy knowledge
distillation. The resulting instruction-tuned model achieves state-of-the-art
performance among billion-parameter models, demonstrating strong generalization
under strict hardware constraints while maintaining competitive accuracy across
a variety of tasks. This work provides a practical and efficient solution for
developing high-performance language models on Ascend edge devices.

TL;DR: DEPTHOR++是一个针对噪声dToF输入的深度补全框架，通过模拟训练、异常检测和专用网络设计，显著提升了深度感知的鲁棒性和精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度补全方法假设理想的dToF输入和完美的dToF-RGB对齐，忽略了实际应用中的校准误差和异常，限制了在真实场景中的适用性。

Method: 1) 基于合成数据集的模拟方法生成真实训练样本；2) 无学习参数异常检测机制识别错误dToF测量；3) 针对噪声dToF输入的深度补全网络，整合RGB图像和单目深度估计先验。

Result: 在多个数据集上取得SOTA性能：ZJU-L5数据集上RMSE和Rel分别平均提升22%和11%；Mirror3D-NYU数据集上镜面区域性能提升37%；Hammer数据集上超越L515测量结果22%。

Conclusion: 该方法能显著提升低成本传感器的性能，使其超越高端设备，在真实世界应用中具有出色的有效性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Depth enhancement, which converts raw dToF signals into dense depth maps
using RGB guidance, is crucial for improving depth perception in high-precision
tasks such as 3D reconstruction and SLAM. However, existing methods often
assume ideal dToF inputs and perfect dToF-RGB alignment, overlooking
calibration errors and anomalies, thus limiting real-world applicability. This
work systematically analyzes the noise characteristics of real-world
lightweight dToF sensors and proposes a practical and novel depth completion
framework, DEPTHOR++, which enhances robustness to noisy dToF inputs from three
key aspects. First, we introduce a simulation method based on synthetic
datasets to generate realistic training samples for robust model training.
Second, we propose a learnable-parameter-free anomaly detection mechanism to
identify and remove erroneous dToF measurements, preventing misleading
propagation during completion. Third, we design a depth completion network
tailored to noisy dToF inputs, which integrates RGB images and pre-trained
monocular depth estimation priors to improve depth recovery in challenging
regions. On the ZJU-L5 dataset and real-world samples, our training strategy
significantly boosts existing depth completion models, with our model achieving
state-of-the-art performance, improving RMSE and Rel by 22% and 11% on average.
On the Mirror3D-NYU dataset, by incorporating the anomaly detection method, our
model improves upon the previous SOTA by 37% in mirror regions. On the Hammer
dataset, using simulated low-cost dToF data from RealSense L515, our method
surpasses the L515 measurements with an average gain of 22%, demonstrating its
potential to enable low-cost sensors to outperform higher-end devices.
Qualitative results across diverse real-world datasets further validate the
effectiveness and generalizability of our approach.

Motivation: 现有视频生成模型和基准测试无法捕捉专业视频生成的复杂性和要求，需要建立面向专业电影制作的结构化评估框架。

Method: 构建了包含76个细粒度控制节点的四个分类体系，开发了自动化的提示分类和问题生成流程，进行了大规模人工研究（10+模型、20K视频、80+电影专业人士标注），并训练了自动评估器。

Result: 即使最强的现有模型在事件和相机相关控制方面仍存在显著差距，训练的自动评估器在专家标注对齐方面优于现有零样本基线。

Conclusion: SCINE是首个将专业视频生成置于视频生成模型背景下的方法，通过以电影控制为中心的分类体系和结构化评估流程为未来研究提供指导。

Abstract: Recent advances in video generation have enabled high-fidelity video
synthesis from user provided prompts. However, existing models and benchmarks
fail to capture the complexity and requirements of professional video
generation. Towards that goal, we introduce Stable Cinemetrics, a structured
evaluation framework that formalizes filmmaking controls into four
disentangled, hierarchical taxonomies: Setup, Event, Lighting, and Camera.
Together, these taxonomies define 76 fine-grained control nodes grounded in
industry practices. Using these taxonomies, we construct a benchmark of prompts
aligned with professional use cases and develop an automated pipeline for
prompt categorization and question generation, enabling independent evaluation
of each control dimension. We conduct a large-scale human study spanning 10+
models and 20K videos, annotated by a pool of 80+ film professionals. Our
analysis, both coarse and fine-grained reveal that even the strongest current
models exhibit significant gaps, particularly in Events and Camera-related
controls. To enable scalable evaluation, we train an automatic evaluator, a
vision-language model aligned with expert annotations that outperforms existing
zero-shot baselines. SCINE is the first approach to situate professional video
generation within the landscape of video generative models, introducing
taxonomies centered around cinematic controls and supporting them with
structured evaluation pipelines and detailed analyses to guide future research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电子显微镜图像连接组学中的人工校对成本是当前扩展连接组学的瓶颈，特别是在制作更大规模的连接组重建或进行对比连接组学研究时。

Method: 利用现有的人工标注数据训练机器学习模型，应用于指导性校对工作流程和自动合并分割片段两个场景。

Result: 在果蝇雄性中枢神经系统重建中，实现了在获得90%校对价值的同时减少80%成本；自动合并了20万个分割片段，相当于4年人工工作量，将连接组连通率提高了1.3个百分点。

Conclusion: 机器学习方法能有效自动化连接组学中的校对工作，大幅降低人工成本并提高效率。

Abstract: Producing connectomes from electron microscopy (EM) images has historically
required a great deal of human proofreading effort. This manual annotation cost
is the current bottleneck in scaling EM connectomics, for example, in making
larger connectome reconstructions feasible, or in enabling comparative
connectomics where multiple related reconstructions are produced. In this work,
we propose using the available ground-truth data generated by this manual
annotation effort to learn a machine learning model to automate or optimize
parts of the required proofreading workflows. We validate our approach on a
recent complete reconstruction of the \emph{Drosophila} male central nervous
system. We first show our method would allow for obtaining 90\% of the value of
a guided proofreading workflow while reducing required cost by 80\%. We then
demonstrate a second application for automatically merging many segmentation
fragments to proofread neurons. Our system is able to automatically attach 200
thousand fragments, equivalent to four proofreader years of manual work, and
increasing the connectivity completion rate of the connectome by 1.3\% points.

TL;DR: DiffCamera是一个基于扩散变换器的模型，能够根据任意新的焦点和模糊程度对已拍摄图像进行灵活的重新对焦，解决了传统景深效果固定难以修改的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统摄影中的景深效果一旦生成就难以修改，当主体失焦时会产生问题。需要一种能够灵活调整图像对焦位置和模糊程度的方法。

Method: 设计扩散变换器框架进行重新对焦学习，通过模拟管道生成大规模不同焦点平面和散景级别的图像对数据，并提出堆叠约束来增强训练，确保物理上准确的景深操作。

Result: 模型能够在各种场景中稳定地进行重新对焦，为摄影和生成式AI应用提供了前所未有的景深调整控制能力。

Conclusion: DiffCamera通过创新的训练约束和模拟数据生成，成功实现了灵活且物理准确的图像重新对焦，扩展了摄影后期处理的可能性。

Abstract: The depth-of-field (DoF) effect, which introduces aesthetically pleasing
blur, enhances photographic quality but is fixed and difficult to modify once
the image has been created. This becomes problematic when the applied blur is
undesirable~(e.g., the subject is out of focus). To address this, we propose
DiffCamera, a model that enables flexible refocusing of a created image
conditioned on an arbitrary new focus point and a blur level. Specifically, we
design a diffusion transformer framework for refocusing learning. However, the
training requires pairs of data with different focus planes and bokeh levels in
the same scene, which are hard to acquire. To overcome this limitation, we
develop a simulation-based pipeline to generate large-scale image pairs with
varying focus planes and bokeh levels. With the simulated data, we find that
training with only a vanilla diffusion objective often leads to incorrect DoF
behaviors due to the complexity of the task. This requires a stronger
constraint during training. Inspired by the photographic principle that photos
of different focus planes can be linearly blended into a multi-focus image, we
propose a stacking constraint during training to enforce precise DoF
manipulation. This constraint enhances model training by imposing physically
grounded refocusing behavior that the focusing results should be faithfully
aligned with the scene structure and the camera conditions so that they can be
combined into the correct multi-focus image. We also construct a benchmark to
evaluate the effectiveness of our refocusing model. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that DiffCamera supports stable refocusing across a wide range of
scenes, providing unprecedented control over DoF adjustments for photography
and generative AI applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态音频生成模型缺乏精确的用户控制能力，无法在专业Foley工作流中优先处理特定对象，经常生成不必要的背景声音或关注错误对象。

Method: 引入视频对象分割感知音频生成新任务，提出SAGANet多模态生成模型，结合视觉分割掩码、视频和文本线索进行可控音频生成。

Result: 相比现有最先进方法有显著改进，为可控、高保真Foley合成设立了新标准。

Conclusion: SAGANet通过对象级分割实现了细粒度和视觉定位的音频控制，并发布了Segmented Music Solos基准数据集支持分割感知Foley研究。

Abstract: Existing multimodal audio generation models often lack precise user control,
which limits their applicability in professional Foley workflows. In
particular, these models focus on the entire video and do not provide precise
methods for prioritizing a specific object within a scene, generating
unnecessary background sounds, or focusing on the wrong objects. To address
this gap, we introduce the novel task of video object segmentation-aware audio
generation, which explicitly conditions sound synthesis on object-level
segmentation maps. We present SAGANet, a new multimodal generative model that
enables controllable audio generation by leveraging visual segmentation masks
along with video and textual cues. Our model provides users with fine-grained
and visually localized control over audio generation. To support this task and
further research on segmentation-aware Foley, we propose Segmented Music Solos,
a benchmark dataset of musical instrument performance videos with segmentation
information. Our method demonstrates substantial improvements over current
state-of-the-art methods and sets a new standard for controllable,
high-fidelity Foley synthesis. Code, samples, and Segmented Music Solos are

Motivation: 面部表情分类面临高维度和复杂性的挑战，需要融合多种特征提取方法来获得更丰富的图像表示。

Method: 融合VGG19深度特征与SIFT、ORB手工特征，使用K-means聚类和UMAP进行降维处理。

Result: 在FER数据集上实现了83.3%的分类准确率，UMAP被证明是最有效的降维方法。

Conclusion: 降维不仅是预处理步骤，更是提升特征质量和分类性能的关键组成部分。

Abstract: Facial expression classification remains a challenging task due to the high
dimensionality and inherent complexity of facial image data. This paper
presents Hy-Facial, a hybrid feature extraction framework that integrates both
deep learning and traditional image processing techniques, complemented by a
systematic investigation of dimensionality reduction strategies. The proposed
method fuses deep features extracted from the Visual Geometry Group 19-layer
network (VGG19) with handcrafted local descriptors and the scale-invariant
feature transform (SIFT) and Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF (ORB) algorithms,
to obtain rich and diverse image representations. To mitigate feature
redundancy and reduce computational complexity, we conduct a comprehensive
evaluation of dimensionality reduction techniques and feature extraction. Among
these, UMAP is identified as the most effective, preserving both local and
global structures of the high-dimensional feature space. The Hy-Facial pipeline
integrated VGG19, SIFT, and ORB for feature extraction, followed by K-means
clustering and UMAP for dimensionality reduction, resulting in a classification
accuracy of 83. 3\% in the facial expression recognition (FER) dataset. These
findings underscore the pivotal role of dimensionality reduction not only as a
pre-processing step but as an essential component in improving feature quality
and overall classification performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决全景深度估计中存在的两个关键问题：全景数据稀缺导致零样本泛化能力差，以及球面失真导致传统方法效率低下。

Method: 提出数据增强引擎从透视图像生成高质量全景深度数据（共607K对），并设计SphereViT模型利用球面坐标强制几何一致性来缓解球面失真。

Result: 在多个数据集上达到最先进性能，AbsRel指标比最强零样本基线平均提升38%，甚至优于先前的域内方法，且效率远高于基于融合的方法。

Conclusion: DA²通过大规模数据增强和球面几何建模，实现了准确、零样本泛化能力强且高效的端到端全景深度估计，解决了该领域的关键挑战。

Abstract: Panorama has a full FoV (360$^\circ\times$180$^\circ$), offering a more
complete visual description than perspective images. Thanks to this
characteristic, panoramic depth estimation is gaining increasing traction in 3D
vision. However, due to the scarcity of panoramic data, previous methods are
often restricted to in-domain settings, leading to poor zero-shot
generalization. Furthermore, due to the spherical distortions inherent in
panoramas, many approaches rely on perspective splitting (e.g., cubemaps),
which leads to suboptimal efficiency. To address these challenges, we propose
$\textbf{DA}$$^{\textbf{2}}$: $\textbf{D}$epth $\textbf{A}$nything in
$\textbf{A}$ny $\textbf{D}$irection, an accurate, zero-shot generalizable, and
fully end-to-end panoramic depth estimator. Specifically, for scaling up
panoramic data, we introduce a data curation engine for generating high-quality
panoramic depth data from perspective, and create $\sim$543K panoramic
RGB-depth pairs, bringing the total to $\sim$607K. To further mitigate the
spherical distortions, we present SphereViT, which explicitly leverages
spherical coordinates to enforce the spherical geometric consistency in
panoramic image features, yielding improved performance. A comprehensive
benchmark on multiple datasets clearly demonstrates DA$^{2}$'s SoTA
performance, with an average 38% improvement on AbsRel over the strongest
zero-shot baseline. Surprisingly, DA$^{2}$ even outperforms prior in-domain
methods, highlighting its superior zero-shot generalization. Moreover, as an
end-to-end solution, DA$^{2}$ exhibits much higher efficiency over fusion-based
approaches. Both the code and the curated panoramic data will be released.

TL;DR: HART是一个用于稀疏视角人体重建的统一框架，能够从少量未标定RGB图像中重建出完整的人体网格、对齐的SMPL-X身体网格和高斯溅射表示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法要么优化参数化模板而忽略宽松衣物和人物交互，要么在简化相机假设下训练隐式函数，限制了实际应用。

Method: 预测逐像素3D点图、法线和身体对应关系，采用遮挡感知的泊松重建恢复完整几何，并与SMPL-X身体模型对齐，最后用高斯溅射进行稀疏视角渲染。

Result: 在多个数据集上取得SOTA结果：穿衣网格重建的Chamfer距离提升18-23%，SMPL-X估计的PA-V2V降低6-27%，新视角合成的LPIPS减少15-27%。

Conclusion: 前馈Transformer可以作为在真实场景中进行鲁棒人体重建的可扩展模型。

Abstract: We introduce HART, a unified framework for sparse-view human reconstruction.
Given a small set of uncalibrated RGB images of a person as input, it outputs a
watertight clothed mesh, the aligned SMPL-X body mesh, and a Gaussian-splat
representation for photorealistic novel-view rendering. Prior methods for
clothed human reconstruction either optimize parametric templates, which
overlook loose garments and human-object interactions, or train implicit
functions under simplified camera assumptions, limiting applicability in real
scenes. In contrast, HART predicts per-pixel 3D point maps, normals, and body
correspondences, and employs an occlusion-aware Poisson reconstruction to
recover complete geometry, even in self-occluded regions. These predictions
also align with a parametric SMPL-X body model, ensuring that reconstructed
geometry remains consistent with human structure while capturing loose clothing
and interactions. These human-aligned meshes initialize Gaussian splats to
further enable sparse-view rendering. While trained on only 2.3K synthetic
scans, HART achieves state-of-the-art results: Chamfer Distance improves by
18-23 percent for clothed-mesh reconstruction, PA-V2V drops by 6-27 percent for
SMPL-X estimation, LPIPS decreases by 15-27 percent for novel-view synthesis on
a wide range of datasets. These results suggest that feed-forward transformers
can serve as a scalable model for robust human reconstruction in real-world
settings. Code and models will be released.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了第一个SIM(3)-等变形状补全网络，通过架构级别的等变性解决传统方法依赖预对齐导致的泛化问题，在去偏评估协议下显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统3D形状补全方法假设扫描数据已预对齐到规范坐标系，这导致网络可能利用姿态和尺度线索记忆绝对位置而非推断内在几何结构。当真实数据缺乏这种对齐时，性能会崩溃。

Method: 引入SIM(3)-等变形状补全网络，其模块化层依次规范化特征、在相似性不变几何上推理，并恢复原始坐标系。采用去偏评估协议消除隐藏线索。

Result: 在PCN基准测试中优于等变和增强基线方法；在KITTI真实驾驶数据上最小匹配距离降低17%，在OmniObject3D室内扫描上Chamfer距离降低14%；在更严格的协议下仍优于竞争对手的偏置设置。

Conclusion: 完整的SIM(3)等变性是实现真正可泛化形状补全的有效途径。

Abstract: 3D shape completion methods typically assume scans are pre-aligned to a
canonical frame. This leaks pose and scale cues that networks may exploit to
memorize absolute positions rather than inferring intrinsic geometry. When such
alignment is absent in real data, performance collapses. We argue that robust
generalization demands architectural equivariance to the similarity group,
SIM(3), so the model remains agnostic to pose and scale. Following this
principle, we introduce the first SIM(3)-equivariant shape completion network,
whose modular layers successively canonicalize features, reason over
similarity-invariant geometry, and restore the original frame. Under a
de-biased evaluation protocol that removes the hidden cues, our model
outperforms both equivariant and augmentation baselines on the PCN benchmark.
It also sets new cross-domain records on real driving and indoor scans,
lowering minimal matching distance on KITTI by 17% and Chamfer distance $\ell1$
on OmniObject3D by 14%. Perhaps surprisingly, ours under the stricter protocol
still outperforms competitors under their biased settings. These results
establish full SIM(3) equivariance as an effective route to truly generalizable
shape completion. Project page: https://sime-completion.github.io.

Method: 使用眼镜式设备记录城市中心的多模态数据，利用测量工具获取厘米级精度的控制点作为间接姿态标注，支持极端场景如夜间行走和车辆行驶的评估。

Conclusion: 该数据集和基准测试为评估SLAM系统在真实头戴式设备场景中的性能提供了重要工具，并设计了不同难度级别的轨迹以支持深入分析。

Abstract: Precise 6-DoF simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) from onboard
sensors is critical for wearable devices capturing egocentric data, which
exhibits specific challenges, such as a wider diversity of motions and
viewpoints, prevalent dynamic visual content, or long sessions affected by
time-varying sensor calibration. While recent progress on SLAM has been swift,
academic research is still driven by benchmarks that do not reflect these
challenges or do not offer sufficiently accurate ground truth poses. In this
paper, we introduce a new dataset and benchmark for visual-inertial SLAM with
egocentric, multi-modal data. We record hours and kilometers of trajectories
through a city center with glasses-like devices equipped with various sensors.
We leverage surveying tools to obtain control points as indirect pose
annotations that are metric, centimeter-accurate, and available at city scale.
This makes it possible to evaluate extreme trajectories that involve walking at
night or traveling in a vehicle. We show that state-of-the-art systems
developed by academia are not robust to these challenges and we identify
components that are responsible for this. In addition, we design tracks with
different levels of difficulty to ease in-depth analysis and evaluation of less
mature approaches. The dataset and benchmark are available at

### [131] [Query-Kontext: An Unified Multimodal Model for Image Generation and Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26641)
*Yuxin Song,Wenkai Dong,Shizun Wang,Qi Zhang,Song Xue,Tao Yuan,Hu Yang,Haocheng Feng,Hang Zhou,Xinyan Xiao,Jingdong Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Query-Kontext方法，通过多模态"kontext"桥接视觉语言模型和扩散模型，将多模态生成推理能力委托给VLM，扩散模型专注于高质量视觉合成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前统一多模态模型中，多模态生成推理能力与高保真合成内在纠缠，需要分离这两种能力以实现更好的性能。

Method: 采用三阶段渐进训练策略：1) 通过多模态kontext令牌连接VLM和轻量扩散头；2) 扩展到大型预训练扩散模型；3) 引入低级图像编码器并进行指令调优。

Result: 实验表明该方法与强大统一基线相当，在某些情况下甚至优于任务特定的最先进方法。

Conclusion: Query-Kontext成功分离了多模态生成推理和视觉合成，为统一多模态模型提供了有效的设计范式。

Abstract: Unified Multimodal Models (UMMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in
text-to-image generation (T2I) and editing (TI2I), whether instantiated as
assembled unified frameworks which couple powerful vision-language model (VLM)
with diffusion-based generator, or as naive Unified Multimodal Models with an
early fusion of understanding and generation modalities. We contend that in
current unified frameworks, the crucial capability of multimodal generative
reasoning which encompasses instruction understanding, grounding, and image
referring for identity preservation and faithful reconstruction, is
intrinsically entangled with high-fidelity synthesis. In this work, we
introduce Query-Kontext, a novel approach that bridges the VLM and diffusion
model via a multimodal ``kontext'' composed of semantic cues and coarse-grained
image conditions encoded from multimodal inputs. This design delegates the
complex ability of multimodal generative reasoning to powerful VLM while
reserving diffusion model's role for high-quality visual synthesis. To achieve
this, we propose a three-stage progressive training strategy. First, we connect
the VLM to a lightweight diffusion head via multimodal kontext tokens to
unleash the VLM's generative reasoning ability. Second, we scale this head to a
large, pre-trained diffusion model to enhance visual detail and realism.
Finally, we introduce a low-level image encoder to improve image fidelity and
perform instruction tuning on downstream tasks. Furthermore, we build a
comprehensive data pipeline integrating real, synthetic, and open-source
datasets, covering diverse multimodal reference-to-image scenarios, including
image generation, instruction-driven editing, customized generation, and
multi-subject composition. Experiments show that our approach matches strong
unified baselines and even outperforms task-specific state-of-the-art methods
in several cases.

*Jessica Bader,Mateusz Pach,Maria A. Bravo,Serge Belongie,Zeynep Akata*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Stitch是一种无需训练的方法，通过自动生成的边界框将外部位置控制集成到多模态扩散变换器(MMDiT)中，显著提升了文本到图像生成模型在空间关系方面的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本到图像生成模型在准确捕捉空间关系方面存在挑战，而早期方法与现代模型架构不兼容，需要一种训练自由的方法来增强位置控制能力。

Method: 通过自动生成边界框，在指定区域内生成单个对象，然后无缝拼接在一起；利用特定的注意力头在生成过程中隔离和裁剪单个对象。

Result: 在PosEval基准测试中，Stitch显著提升了基础模型性能，将FLUX在GenEval位置任务上的表现提升了218%，在PosEval上提升了206%；使用Qwen-Image在PosEval上比之前模型提升了54%。

Conclusion: Stitch无需训练即可将位置控制集成到领先模型中，在保持视觉吸引力的同时实现了空间准确性的最先进结果。

Abstract: Text-to-Image (T2I) generation models have advanced rapidly in recent years,
but accurately capturing spatial relationships like "above" or "to the right
of" poses a persistent challenge. Earlier methods improved spatial relationship
following with external position control. However, as architectures evolved to
enhance image quality, these techniques became incompatible with modern models.
We propose Stitch, a training-free method for incorporating external position
control into Multi-Modal Diffusion Transformers (MMDiT) via
automatically-generated bounding boxes. Stitch produces images that are both
spatially accurate and visually appealing by generating individual objects
within designated bounding boxes and seamlessly stitching them together. We
find that targeted attention heads capture the information necessary to isolate
and cut out individual objects mid-generation, without needing to fully
complete the image. We evaluate Stitch on PosEval, our benchmark for
position-based T2I generation. Featuring five new tasks that extend the concept
of Position beyond the basic GenEval task, PosEval demonstrates that even top
models still have significant room for improvement in position-based
generation. Tested on Qwen-Image, FLUX, and SD3.5, Stitch consistently enhances
base models, even improving FLUX by 218% on GenEval's Position task and by 206%
on PosEval. Stitch achieves state-of-the-art results with Qwen-Image on
PosEval, improving over previous models by 54%, all accomplished while
integrating position control into leading models training-free. Code is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TTT3R通过测试时训练视角改进3D重建基础模型，利用记忆状态与观测的对齐置信度推导闭式学习率，显著提升长度泛化能力，在全局姿态估计上实现2倍改进，以20FPS和6GB显存处理数千图像。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代循环神经网络在3D重建中因线性时间复杂度而具有竞争力，但在超出训练上下文长度时性能显著下降，表现出有限的长度泛化能力。

Method: 从测试时训练视角重新审视3D重建基础模型，将其设计视为在线学习问题。利用记忆状态与输入观测之间的对齐置信度推导闭式学习率，平衡历史信息保留与新观测适应。

Result: TTT3R显著改善了长度泛化，在全局姿态估计上比基线方法提升2倍，以20FPS速度和仅6GB GPU内存处理数千张图像。

Conclusion: 基于测试时训练视角的训练无关干预方法TTT3R有效解决了3D重建中循环神经网络的长度泛化问题，实现了高效的大规模场景重建。

Abstract: Modern Recurrent Neural Networks have become a competitive architecture for
3D reconstruction due to their linear-time complexity. However, their
performance degrades significantly when applied beyond the training context
length, revealing limited length generalization. In this work, we revisit the
3D reconstruction foundation models from a Test-Time Training perspective,
framing their designs as an online learning problem. Building on this
perspective, we leverage the alignment confidence between the memory state and
incoming observations to derive a closed-form learning rate for memory updates,
to balance between retaining historical information and adapting to new
observations. This training-free intervention, termed TTT3R, substantially
improves length generalization, achieving a $2\times$ improvement in global
pose estimation over baselines, while operating at 20 FPS with just 6 GB of GPU
memory to process thousands of images. Code available in

### [134] [Cyclic Ablation: Testing Concept Localization against Functional Regeneration in AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25220)
*Eduard Kapelko*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 通过循环消融方法测试语言模型中欺骗行为是否可被局部移除，发现欺骗行为具有高度韧性，每次消融后都能通过对抗训练恢复，且这种"神经外科手术"会导致语言性能逐渐下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究语言模型中的不良行为（如欺骗）是否是可局部移除的功能，还是与模型核心认知能力深度交织。

Method: 引入"循环消融"方法，结合稀疏自编码器、定向消融和对抗训练，在DistilGPT-2模型上尝试消除欺骗概念。

Result: 欺骗行为具有高度韧性，模型通过对抗训练持续恢复欺骗行为（功能再生），且每次消融尝试都导致语言性能逐渐下降（困惑度上升）。

Conclusion: 复杂概念是分布式且相互纠缠的，通过机制可解释性进行直接模型编辑存在局限性。

Abstract: Safety and controllability are critical for large language models. A central
question is whether undesirable behaviors like deception are localized
functions that can be removed, or if they are deeply intertwined with a model's
core cognitive abilities. We introduce "cyclic ablation," an iterative method
to test this. By combining sparse autoencoders, targeted ablation, and
adversarial training on DistilGPT-2, we attempted to eliminate the concept of
deception. We found that, contrary to the localization hypothesis, deception
was highly resilient. The model consistently recovered its deceptive behavior
after each ablation cycle via adversarial training, a process we term
functional regeneration. Crucially, every attempt at this "neurosurgery" caused
a gradual but measurable decay in general linguistic performance, reflected by
a consistent rise in perplexity. These findings are consistent with the view
that complex concepts are distributed and entangled, underscoring the
limitations of direct model editing through mechanistic interpretability.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文通过证明内部模型表示的几何特性可作为评估生成文本质量的可靠代理，连接了大型语言模型的内部分析和外部分析方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了开发无需人工标注数据集的无参考文本质量评估方法，探索内部模型表示的几何特性是否能够可靠地反映文本质量。

Method: 验证了一组度量指标，包括最大可解释方差、有效秩、内在维度、MAUVE分数和Schatten范数，在不同LLM层中进行测量。

Result: 发现内在维度和有效秩可作为文本自然性和质量的通用评估指标，不同模型基于这些几何特性对各种来源的文本进行一致的排序。

Conclusion: 这些几何指标反映了文本的固有特征而非模型特定伪影，为自动化评估流程提供了无需参考文本的实用文本质量评估方法。

Abstract: This paper bridges internal and external analysis approaches to large
language models (LLMs) by demonstrating that geometric properties of internal
model representations serve as reliable proxies for evaluating generated text
quality. We validate a set of metrics including Maximum Explainable Variance,
Effective Rank, Intrinsic Dimensionality, MAUVE score, and Schatten Norms
measured across different layers of LLMs, demonstrating that Intrinsic
Dimensionality and Effective Rank can serve as universal assessments of text
naturalness and quality. Our key finding reveals that different models
consistently rank text from various sources in the same order based on these
geometric properties, indicating that these metrics reflect inherent text
characteristics rather than model-specific artifacts. This allows a
reference-free text quality evaluation that does not require human-annotated
datasets, offering practical advantages for automated evaluation pipelines.

*Andy Liu,Kshitish Ghate,Mona Diab,Daniel Fried,Atoosa Kasirzadeh,Max Kleiman-Weiner*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ConflictScope是一个自动评估LLM在价值冲突中如何优先排序不同价值的框架，通过生成价值冲突场景来测试模型的价值排序能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对齐数据集缺乏价值冲突场景，需要评估LLM在价值冲突中的优先排序能力。

Method: 构建自动管道，从用户定义的价值集合中采样两个冲突价值生成场景，使用LLM编写的用户提示测试目标模型，评估其自由文本响应以推导价值排序。

Result: 模型在开放式评估中更倾向于支持个人价值而非保护性价值；在系统提示中加入详细价值排序可将对齐度提高14%。

Conclusion: 评估模型价值优先排序很重要，系统提示能在价值冲突中适度改善LLM行为对齐，为未来研究提供基础。

Abstract: Past work seeks to align large language model (LLM)-based assistants with a
target set of values, but such assistants are frequently forced to make
tradeoffs between values when deployed. In response to the scarcity of value
conflict in existing alignment datasets, we introduce ConflictScope, an
automatic pipeline to evaluate how LLMs prioritize different values. Given a
user-defined value set, ConflictScope automatically generates scenarios in
which a language model faces a conflict between two values sampled from the
set. It then prompts target models with an LLM-written "user prompt" and
evaluates their free-text responses to elicit a ranking over values in the
value set. Comparing results between multiple-choice and open-ended
evaluations, we find that models shift away from supporting protective values,
such as harmlessness, and toward supporting personal values, such as user
autonomy, in more open-ended value conflict settings. However, including
detailed value orderings in models' system prompts improves alignment with a
target ranking by 14%, showing that system prompting can achieve moderate
success at aligning LLM behavior under value conflict. Our work demonstrates
the importance of evaluating value prioritization in models and provides a
foundation for future work in this area.

*Qiyao Ma,Yunsheng Shi,Hongtao Tian,Chao Wang,Weiming Chang,Ting Yao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了思考监督奖励模型（TRM），通过句子级思考监督赋予奖励模型批判性思维能力，解决了RLVR在复杂任务中难以验证正确性的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RLVR在数学和编程等可验证领域取得进展，但在开放域问答等复杂任务中面临验证困难。现有方法过度关注与支持文档的语义对齐，导致模型过度依赖外部知识而缺乏批判性评估能力。

Method: TRM模型首先评估每个答案句子与支持文档的忠实度，然后通过推理步骤评估句子级正确性，将奖励建模结构化为忠实度、推理和正确性评估的序列。

Result: 实验表明TRM显著提高了错误句子的识别能力，将TRM纳入策略优化后，在答案正确性和实用性方面都取得了显著提升。

Conclusion: TRM通过引入批判性思考监督，使模型能够平衡利用外部和内部知识，有效提升了复杂任务中的答案质量。

Abstract: Through reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR), large language
models have achieved substantial progress in domains with easily verifiable
outcomes, such as mathematics and coding. However, when applied to more complex
tasks like open-domain question answering, RLVR faces significant challenges
due to the difficulty of verifying correctness. The nuanced and ambiguous
nature of real-world knowledge makes it difficult to reliably evaluate
correctness in these settings, necessitating further abilities that extend
beyond mere logical consistency to encompass an understanding and assessment of
both external and internal knowledge. Recent work has primarily focused on
improving faithfulness, defined as semantic alignment with supporting
documents, which can cause models to rely excessively on external sources and
diminish their capacity for critical assessment. To address this, we propose
the Thinking-supervised Reward Model (TRM), which incorporates sentence-level
thinking supervision to endow reward models with critical thinking abilities.
Given a query, answer, and supporting documents, TRM first assesses the
faithfulness of each answer sentence to the supporting documents, and then
applies a reasoning step to evaluate sentence-level correctness. By structuring
reward modeling as a sequence of faithfulness, reasoning, and correctness
evaluations, TRM encourages models to critically assess and leverage both
external and internal knowledge. Experiments on reward signals demonstrate that
TRM substantially improves the identification of incorrect sentences, and
incorporating TRM into policy optimization leads to significant gains in both
answer correctness and usefulness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有情感文本到语音方法依赖粗粒度标签或代理分类器，只能获得语句级反馈，无法进行细粒度情感控制。

Method: 引入EASPO框架，使用时间条件模型EASPM对噪声中间语音状态评分并自动构建偏好对，通过逐步偏好优化实现情感塑造。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在表达性和自然度方面均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: EASPO通过中间去噪步骤的细粒度偏好优化，实现了更精确可控的情感文本到语音生成。

Abstract: Emotional text-to-speech seeks to convey affect while preserving
intelligibility and prosody, yet existing methods rely on coarse labels or
proxy classifiers and receive only utterance-level feedback. We introduce
Emotion-Aware Stepwise Preference Optimization (EASPO), a post-training
framework that aligns diffusion TTS with fine-grained emotional preferences at
intermediate denoising steps. Central to our approach is EASPM, a
time-conditioned model that scores noisy intermediate speech states and enables
automatic preference pair construction. EASPO optimizes generation to match
these stepwise preferences, enabling controllable emotional shaping.
Experiments show superior performance over existing methods in both
expressiveness and naturalness.

TL;DR: 提出了SimulRAG框架，通过科学模拟器检索增强生成，解决大语言模型在长形式科学问答中的幻觉问题，在信息量和事实性方面显著优于传统RAG方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在科学问答中存在幻觉问题，特别是在需要详细解释的长形式回答中。科学模拟器作为验证假设的重要工具，有望通过检索增强生成来提升答案的事实性。

Method: 提出SimulRAG框架，包括通用模拟器检索接口（实现文本与数值模态转换）和基于不确定性估计与模拟器边界评估的声明级生成方法（UE+SBA）。

Result: 实验显示SimulRAG在信息量上比传统RAG基线提升30.4%，在事实性上提升16.3%。UE+SBA进一步提高了声明级生成的效率和质量。

Conclusion: SimulRAG框架有效解决了科学模拟器检索的挑战，显著提升了长形式科学问答的准确性和可靠性，为科学领域的LLM应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show promise in solving scientific problems.
They can help generate long-form answers for scientific questions, which are
crucial for comprehensive understanding of complex phenomena that require
detailed explanations spanning multiple interconnected concepts and evidence.
However, LLMs often suffer from hallucination, especially in the challenging
task of long-form scientific question answering. Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) approaches can ground LLMs by incorporating external knowledge sources to
improve trustworthiness. In this context, scientific simulators, which play a
vital role in validating hypotheses, offer a particularly promising retrieval
source to mitigate hallucination and enhance answer factuality. However,
existing RAG approaches cannot be directly applied for scientific
simulation-based retrieval due to two fundamental challenges: how to retrieve
from scientific simulators, and how to efficiently verify and update long-form
answers. To overcome these challenges, we propose the simulator-based RAG
framework (SimulRAG) and provide a long-form scientific QA benchmark covering
climate science and epidemiology with ground truth verified by both simulations
and human annotators. In this framework, we propose a generalized simulator
retrieval interface to transform between textual and numerical modalities. We
further design a claim-level generation method that utilizes uncertainty
estimation scores and simulator boundary assessment (UE+SBA) to efficiently
verify and update claims. Extensive experiments demonstrate SimulRAG
outperforms traditional RAG baselines by 30.4% in informativeness and 16.3% in
factuality. UE+SBA further improves efficiency and quality for claim-level
generation.

TL;DR: 评估ChatGPT、Gemini和NotebookLM在新闻报道任务中的幻觉问题，发现30%输出包含至少一个幻觉，Gemini和ChatGPT的幻觉率是NotebookLM的3倍。主要问题是解释性过度自信而非虚构实体。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估LLMs在新闻编辑室工作流程中的使用风险，特别是对新闻核心实践（来源、归属、准确性）的威胁。

Method: 使用300个与TikTok诉讼和政策相关的文档语料库，在报告式任务中评估三个工具，变化提示特异性和上下文大小，使用分类法标注句子级输出的幻觉类型和严重程度。

Result: 30%的模型输出包含至少一个幻觉，Gemini和ChatGPT的幻觉率约为40%，NotebookLM为13%。大多数错误涉及解释性过度自信，模型添加了未经支持的来源特征描述，并将归因观点转化为一般陈述。

Conclusion: 揭示了根本的认识论不匹配：新闻需要每个主张都有明确来源，而LLMs无论证据支持如何都会生成权威性文本。建议新闻特定的幻觉分类法扩展，并需要能够强制执行准确归属而非优化流畅性的架构。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in newsroom workflows, but
their tendency to hallucinate poses risks to core journalistic practices of
sourcing, attribution, and accuracy. We evaluate three widely used tools -
ChatGPT, Gemini, and NotebookLM - on a reporting-style task grounded in a
300-document corpus related to TikTok litigation and policy in the U.S. We vary
prompt specificity and context size and annotate sentence-level outputs using a
taxonomy to measure hallucination type and severity. Across our sample, 30% of
model outputs contained at least one hallucination, with rates approximately
three times higher for Gemini and ChatGPT (40%) than for NotebookLM (13%).
Qualitatively, most errors did not involve invented entities or numbers;
instead, we observed interpretive overconfidence - models added unsupported
characterizations of sources and transformed attributed opinions into general
statements. These patterns reveal a fundamental epistemological mismatch: While
journalism requires explicit sourcing for every claim, LLMs generate
authoritative-sounding text regardless of evidentiary support. We propose
journalism-specific extensions to existing hallucination taxonomies and argue
that effective newsroom tools need architectures that enforce accurate
attribution rather than optimize for fluency.

Motivation: 探索端到端多语言ASR模型内部机制，特别是跨语言公平性和效能问题，这些在聚合错误率中被掩盖。

Method: 通过追踪束搜索路径，捕获子词猜测及其相关概率，使用PCA和t-SNE分析子词使用模式。

Result: 高资源语言正确令牌排名更高、置信度更高、预测熵更低、候选多样性更大；低资源语言表现较差，但显示出受类型学影响的子词使用聚类模式。

Conclusion: 子词探测揭示了被聚合错误率掩盖的系统性解码差异，为改善语音技术不平衡发展提供了针对性干预方向。

Abstract: While large multilingual automatic speech recognition (ASR) models achieve
remarkable performance, the internal mechanisms of the end-to-end pipeline,
particularly concerning fairness and efficacy across languages, remain
underexplored. This paper introduces a fine-grained analysis of Whisper's
multilingual decoder, examining its sub-token hypotheses during transcription
across languages with various resource levels. Our method traces the beam
search path, capturing sub-token guesses and their associated probabilities.
Results reveal that higher resource languages benefit from higher likelihood of
the correct token being top-ranked, greater confidence, lower predictive
entropy, and more diverse alternative candidates. Lower resource languages fare
worse on these metrics, but also exhibit distinct clustering patterns in
sub-token usage sometimes influenced by typology in our PCA and t-SNE analysis.
This sub-token probing uncovers systematic decoding disparities masked by
aggregate error rates and points towards targeted interventions to ameliorate
the imbalanced development of speech technology.

Motivation: 旨在提供法律风险最小化的预训练数据，减少对无差别网络抓取的依赖，同时保持模型竞争力。

Method: 采用多阶段管道进行许可感知过滤、安全和质量筛选，结合公共领域文本、许可文本、政府作品、欧盟TDM合格来源以及指令、推理和合成数据。

Result: 在130M/400M/1.3B/1.7B参数规模的实验中，MixtureVitae训练的模型在标准基准测试中持续优于其他许可数据集，在1.7B/300B设置下接近DCLM性能，在数学/代码任务上表现特别强。

Conclusion: 基于许可优先、风险缓解的数据为训练有能力的LLM提供了实用且法律上缓解的基础，在不牺牲竞争力的前提下减少对无差别网络抓取的依赖。

Abstract: We present MixtureVitae, an open-access pretraining corpus built to minimize
legal risk while providing strong model performance. MixtureVitae follows a
risk-mitigated sourcing strategy that combines public-domain and permissively
licensed text (e.g., CC-BY/Apache) with carefully justified low-risk additions
(e.g., government works and EU TDM-eligible sources), alongside targeted
instruction, reasoning and synthetic data with documented provenance. We detail
a transparent, multi-stage pipeline for license-aware filtering, safety and
quality screening, and domain-aware mixing, and we release the dataset and
curation recipes to support reproducible research. In controlled experiments
using the open-sci-ref training protocol (fixed architectures at
130M/400M/1.3B/1.7B parameters; training budgets of 50B and 300B tokens),
models trained on MixtureVitae consistently outperform other permissive
datasets across a suite of standard benchmarks, and at the 1.7B/300B setting
they surpass FineWeb-Edu and approach DCLM in the later stages of training.
Performance is particularly strong on math/code and competitive on QA tasks.
These results demonstrate that permissive-first, risk-mitigated data provides a
practical and legally mitigated foundation for training capable LLMs, reducing
reliance on indiscriminate web scraping without sacrificing competitiveness.

Motivation: LLM生成的置信度分数通常存在校准问题，在低准确率实例上表现出过度自信，这损害了用户信任和安全性。研究发现这种过度自信源于LLM对信息较少的声明具有更高的易受暗示性。

Method: 引入Distractor-Normalized Coherence (DINCO)，通过让模型在多个自生成的干扰项上独立表达置信度，并基于总置信度进行归一化来估计和校正易受暗示性偏差。同时利用生成器-验证器不一致性，将归一化验证器置信度与基于一致性的生成器置信度估计相结合。

Result: DINCO提供了更少饱和且更可用的置信度估计，在10次推理调用下优于100次调用的自一致性基线方法，进一步采样无法弥补DINCO与基线之间的差距。

Conclusion: DINCO通过整合跨采样生成和跨不兼容声明验证的互补连贯性维度，有效改善了LLM置信度校准，提供了更可靠和可用的置信度估计。

Abstract: Calibrated confidence estimates are necessary for large language model (LLM)
outputs to be trusted by human users. While LLMs can express their confidence
in human-interpretable ways, verbalized LLM-generated confidence scores have
empirically been found to be miscalibrated, reporting high confidence on
instances with low accuracy and thereby harming trust and safety. We
hypothesize that this overconfidence often stems from a given LLM's heightened
suggestibility when faced with claims that it encodes little information about;
we empirically validate this hypothesis, finding more suggestibility on
lower-accuracy claims. Building on this finding, we introduce
Distractor-Normalized Coherence (DINCO), which estimates and accounts for an
LLM's suggestibility bias by having the model verbalize its confidence
independently across several self-generated distractors (i.e. alternative
claims), and normalizes by the total verbalized confidence. To further improve
calibration, we leverage generator-validator disagreement, augmenting
normalized validator confidence with a consistency-based estimate of generator
confidence. Here, we frame the popular approach of self-consistency as
leveraging coherence across sampled generations, and normalized verbalized
confidence as leveraging coherence across validations on incompatible claims,
allowing us to integrate these complementary dimensions of coherence into
DINCO. Moreover, our analysis shows that DINCO provides less saturated -- and
therefore more usable -- confidence estimates, and that further sampling alone
cannot close the gap between DINCO and baselines, with DINCO at 10 inference
calls outperforming self-consistency at 100.

TL;DR: 提出了Self-Rewarding Rubric-Based Reinforcement Learning框架，通过模型自身作为评分器和生成基于规则的奖励信号，显著提升推理性能，同时使模型成为更强的评分器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在HealthBench研究中发现，使用模型自身作为评分器并生成基于规则的奖励信号可以显著改善推理性能，同时训练后的模型也成为更强的评分器。

Method: 引入Self-Rewarding Rubric-Based Reinforcement Learning for Open-Ended Reasoning框架，这是一种轻量级方法，支持更快、更资源高效的训练。

Result: 在Qwen3-32B上，仅使用4000样本的HealthBench Easy子集进行训练，获得的模型在HealthBench Hard上就超过了GPT-5。加入少量教师评分数据可进一步提升性能。

Conclusion: 该框架在开放端推理任务中表现出色，实现了资源高效训练并超越了基线方法。

Abstract: Open-ended evaluation is essential for deploying large language models in
real-world settings. In studying HealthBench, we observe that using the model
itself as a grader and generating rubric-based reward signals substantially
improves reasoning performance. Remarkably, the trained model also becomes a
stronger grader. Motivated by this, we introduce Self-Rewarding Rubric-Based
Reinforcement Learning for Open-Ended Reasoning, a lightweight framework that
enables faster and more resource-efficient training while surpassing baselines.
Remarkably, on Qwen3-32B, training with just the 4000-sample HealthBench Easy
subset is sufficient to obtain a model that exceeds GPT-5 on HealthBench Hard.
Incorporating a small amount of teacher-graded data further enhances
performance for less capable models.

TL;DR: 提出PB-RLSVR框架，通过英语LLM作为枢轴模型生成参考响应，使用语义等价性奖励来提升多语言推理能力，无需目标语言的人工标注数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决强化学习在LLMs中主要局限于英语的问题，缩小不同语言间的性能差距。

Method: 使用高性能英语LLM作为枢轴模型生成参考响应，基于嵌入和机器翻译的跨语言语义奖励函数来训练多语言模型。

Result: 在Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct和Qwen3-32B上分别提升多语言平均性能16.41%和10.17%，显著优于传统PPO基线。

Conclusion: PB-RLSVR是一种强大且数据高效的方法，能够构建真正的多语言推理代理。

Abstract: While reinforcement learning has advanced the reasoning abilities of Large
Language Models (LLMs), these gains are largely confined to English, creating a
significant performance disparity across languages. To address this, we
introduce Pivot-Based Reinforcement Learning with Semantically Verifiable
Rewards (PB-RLSVR), a novel framework that enhances multilingual reasoning by
circumventing the need for human-annotated data in target languages. Our
approach employs a high-performing English LLM as a "pivot" model to generate
reference responses for reasoning tasks. A multilingual model is then rewarded
based on the semantic equivalence of its responses to the English reference,
effectively transferring the pivot model's reasoning capabilities across
languages. We investigate several cross-lingual semantic reward functions,
including those based on embeddings and machine translation. Extensive
experiments on a suite of multilingual reasoning benchmarks show that our
method significantly narrows the performance gap between English and other
languages, substantially outperforming traditional PPO baselines. Specifically,
our PB-RLSVR framework improves the average multilingual performance of
Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct and Qwen3-32B by 16.41% and 10.17%, respectively,
demonstrating a powerful and data-efficient approach to building truly
multilingual reasoning agents.

TL;DR: 提出新的计算参数来测量儿童对空主语祈使句的误解，并将其纳入强制性主语语法学习模型，支持了Orfitelli和Hyams关于临时空主语语法的假设。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究儿童在4岁前经常省略主语的现象，特别是英语儿童混淆祈使句空主语和陈述句的问题，探索临时空主语语法的形成机制。

Method: 使用改进的变分学习器（Yang, 2012），该模型适用于超集-子集语言，通过模拟强制性主语语法学习过程来验证假设。

Result: 模拟结果支持Orfitelli和Hyams的假设，表明儿童确实会因表现影响而暂时采用空主语语法。

Conclusion: 本研究为将计算模型整合到语法习得研究中提供了一个框架，同时考虑其他关键发展因素。

Abstract: The empirically established null subject (NS) stage, lasting until about 4
years of age, involves frequent omission of subjects by children. Orfitelli and
Hyams (2012) observe that young English speakers often confuse imperative NS
utterances with declarative ones due to performance influences, promoting a
temporary null subject grammar. We propose a new computational parameter to
measure this misinterpretation and incorporate it into a simulated model of
obligatory subject grammar learning. Using a modified version of the
Variational Learner (Yang, 2012) which works for superset-subset languages, our
simulations support Orfitelli and Hyams' hypothesis. More generally, this study
outlines a framework for integrating computational models in the study of
grammatical acquisition alongside other key developmental factors.

TL;DR: 提出了PDP（Pairwise Difference Pearson）这一新的机器翻译元评估指标，通过使用成对差异而非原始分数来解决传统Pearson和Kendall方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统基于Pearson's ρ和Kendall's τ的机器翻译元评估方法在鲁棒性和准确性方面的不足。

Method: PDP是一种基于相关性的指标，利用所有段落的成对差异信息，通过段内成对差异比较来改进全局Pearson方法。

Result: 在WMT'24共享任务中，PDP能够正确排序哨兵评估指标，比先前工作更好地与人类错误权重对齐。噪声注入分析显示PDP对随机噪声、段落偏差和系统偏差具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: PDP是一个鲁棒的机器翻译元评估指标，能够更准确地反映评估质量，但对极端异常值敏感。

Abstract: This paper introduces Pairwise Difference Pearson (PDP), a novel
segment-level meta-evaluation metric for Machine Translation (MT) that address
limitations in previous Pearson's $\rho$-based and and Kendall's $\tau$-based
meta-evaluation approaches. PDP is a correlation-based metric that utilizes
pairwise differences rather than raw scores. It draws on information from all
segments for a more robust understanding of score distributions and uses
segment-wise pairwise differences to refine Global Pearson to intra-segment
score comparisons. Analysis on the WMT'24 shared task shows PDP properly ranks
sentinel evaluation metrics and better aligns with human error weightings than
previous work. Noise injection analysis demonstrates PDP's robustness to random
noise, segment bias, and system bias while highlighting its sensitivity to
extreme outliers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于Transformer的视觉语言模型在零样本设置下难以生成特定风格（如幽默、浪漫）的图像描述，而获取偏好数据成本高昂，限制了模型能力的充分探索

Method: 研究小规模视觉语言模型的数据效率，通过少量偏好数据对齐模型至幽默和浪漫风格，确定实现风格饱和所需的最小数据量

Result: 定义了这些模型在风格对齐方面的性能极限，并确定了实现风格饱和所需的最少偏好数据量

Conclusion: 通过研究小规模视觉语言模型的数据效率，可以基准化它们在风格对齐方面的能力和限制，为高效模型训练提供指导

Abstract: Vision-language models are increasingly used to generate image captions in
specific styles, such as humor or romantic. However, these transformer-based
models often struggle with this subjective task in a zero-shot setting. While
preference data can be used to align them toward a desired style, such data is
expensive to acquire, limiting the ability to explore the models' full
capabilities. This work addresses this by studying the data efficiency of
aligning small vision-language models to humor and romantic styles. This
approach helps to define the performance limits of these models and determine
how little preference data is needed to achieve stylistic saturation,
benchmarking their capabilities and limitations.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了RFG方法，一种无需显式过程奖励就能指导扩散大语言模型推理轨迹的原则性方法，通过参数化过程奖励为增强模型和参考模型的似然比来实现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散大语言模型在解决复杂问题时需要逐步指导推理过程，但传统方法需要为每个中间步骤进行密集标注，这在dLLMs中具有挑战性，因为生成是任意顺序的且中间状态是部分掩码的句子。

Method: RFG通过将过程奖励参数化为增强dLLM和参考dLLM的对数似然比来实现，增强模型可以通过任何现成的经过RL或SFT后训练的dLLM轻松获得。

Result: 在四个具有挑战性的数学推理和代码生成基准测试中，RFG在所有任务和模型类型上都取得了显著改进，准确率提升高达9.2%。

Conclusion: RFG作为一种通用的无需训练框架，可以在不依赖外部奖励模型的情况下扩展测试时推理能力。

Abstract: Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) have shown great potential in
large-scale language modeling, and there is an increasing interest in further
improving the capacity to solve complex problems by guiding the reasoning
process step by step. Common practice for autoregressive language models
typically learns a process reward model with dense annotation for each
intermediate step. However, this is challenging for dLLMs where the generation
is in an any-order fashion and intermediate states are partially masked
sentences. To this end, in this paper, we propose reward-free guidance (RFG), a
principled method for guiding the reasoning trajectory of dLLMs without
explicit process reward. The key idea of RFG is to parameterize the process
reward by log-likelihood ratios of the enhanced and reference dLLMs, where the
enhanced model can be easily obtained by any off-the-shelf dLLM that has been
post-trained with reinforcement learning (RL) or supervised fine-tuning (SFT).
We provide theoretical justification that RFG induces the reward-guided
sampling distribution with no additional reward. We conduct comprehensive
experiments on four challenging mathematical reasoning and code generation
benchmarks using a diverse suite of dLLMs enhanced with various post-training
methods. RFG consistently yields significant improvements across all tasks and
model types, achieving accuracy gains of up to 9.2%. These findings establish
RFG as a general training-free framework that scales test-time reasoning
without reliance on external reward models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究Transformer架构处理任意大量上下文标记的能力，从数学上统一分析其表达能力，将神经网络建模为概率测度上的映射。

Method: 将Transformer建模为概率测度之间的映射，通过前推操作表示上下文映射，分析这类映射的数学特性。

Result: 完全刻画了能够通过Transformer表示的测度映射的特性：保持支撑基数不变且其Fréchet导数的正则部分一致连续。证明了Transformer能够近似Vlasov方程的解映射。

Conclusion: Transformer架构能够普遍近似任何连续的上下文映射表示，同时测度理论的自注意力具有确保无限深度、平均场测度理论Transformer可识别为Vlasov流的特性。

Abstract: Transformers are deep architectures that define ``in-context maps'' which
enable predicting new tokens based on a given set of tokens (such as a prompt
in NLP applications or a set of patches for a vision transformer). In previous
work, we studied the ability of these architectures to handle an arbitrarily
large number of context tokens. To mathematically, uniformly analyze their
expressivity, we considered the case that the mappings are conditioned on a
context represented by a probability distribution which becomes discrete for a
finite number of tokens. Modeling neural networks as maps on probability
measures has multiple applications, such as studying Wasserstein regularity,
proving generalization bounds and doing a mean-field limit analysis of the
dynamics of interacting particles as they go through the network. In this work,
we study the question what kind of maps between measures are transformers. We
fully characterize the properties of maps between measures that enable these to
be represented in terms of in-context maps via a push forward. On the one hand,
these include transformers; on the other hand, transformers universally
approximate representations with any continuous in-context map. These
properties are preserving the cardinality of support and that the regular part
of their Fr\'{e}chet derivative is uniformly continuous. Moreover, we show that
the solution map of the Vlasov equation, which is of nonlocal transport type,
for interacting particle systems in the mean-field regime for the Cauchy
problem satisfies the conditions on the one hand and, hence, can be
approximated by a transformer; on the other hand, we prove that the
measure-theoretic self-attention has the properties that ensure that the
infinite depth, mean-field measure-theoretic transformer can be identified with
a Vlasov flow.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个用于大规模研究新闻媒体选择性和框架性偏见的数据集和计算框架，结合大语言模型和实时新闻抓取技术，从句子、文章和发布者三个层面量化媒体偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 主流新闻机构不仅通过发布文章直接影响公众认知，还通过选择报道哪些话题（或忽略哪些话题）以及如何框架报道内容来塑造公众认知。然而，大规模测量这些微妙的媒体偏见形式仍然是一个挑战。

Method: 开发了一个集成了大语言模型与可扩展、近实时新闻抓取的数据管道，提取结构化注释（包括政治倾向、语气、主题、文章类型和重大事件），每天处理数百篇文章。

Result: 创建了一个大型、持续更新的数据集和交互式网络平台，能够从句子、文章和发布者三个层面量化媒体偏见，为研究现代新闻环境中的媒体偏见提供了新的分析方法。

Conclusion: 这些贡献建立了一个可重复的大规模研究媒体偏见的方法论，为未来研究提供了实证资源，通过分析2024年15万+篇文章展示了该数据集如何揭示新闻报道和偏见中的有洞察力的模式。

Abstract: Mainstream news organizations shape public perception not only directly
through the articles they publish but also through the choices they make about
which topics to cover (or ignore) and how to frame the issues they do decide to
cover. However, measuring these subtle forms of media bias at scale remains a
challenge. Here, we introduce a large, ongoing (from January 1, 2024 to
present), near real-time dataset and computational framework developed to
enable systematic study of selection and framing bias in news coverage. Our
pipeline integrates large language models (LLMs) with scalable, near-real-time
news scraping to extract structured annotations -- including political lean,
tone, topics, article type, and major events -- across hundreds of articles per
day. We quantify these dimensions of coverage at multiple levels -- the
sentence level, the article level, and the publisher level -- expanding the
ways in which researchers can analyze media bias in the modern news landscape.
In addition to a curated dataset, we also release an interactive web platform
for convenient exploration of these data. Together, these contributions
establish a reusable methodology for studying media bias at scale, providing
empirical resources for future research. Leveraging the breadth of the corpus
over time and across publishers, we also present some examples (focused on the
150,000+ articles examined in 2024) that illustrate how this novel data set can
reveal insightful patterns in news coverage and bias, supporting academic
research and real-world efforts to improve media accountability.

TL;DR: QFrBLiMP是一个用于评估LLM在魁北克法语语法现象理解能力的基准语料库，包含1,761对最小对立句，涵盖20种语言现象。研究发现模型性能随规模增长，但在需要深层语义理解的任务上表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 创建专门针对魁北克法语的基准语料库，评估LLM在该方言变体上的语法知识能力，并与人类表现进行比较。

Method: 从魁北克政府官方资源中提取句子并手动修改创建最小对立句，由12名母语者标注语法性，通过比较LLM对句子概率的分配来评估其能力。

Result: 模型语法能力随规模增长，但所有模型在需要深层语义理解的现象上持续失败，与人类表现存在显著差距。

Conclusion: LLM在魁北克法语语法理解上存在明显局限，特别是在语义理解方面，需要进一步改进。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the Quebec-French Benchmark of Linguistic Minimal
Pairs (QFrBLiMP), a corpus designed to evaluate the linguistic knowledge of
LLMs on prominent grammatical phenomena in Quebec-French. QFrBLiMP consists of
1,761 minimal pairs annotated with 20 linguistic phenomena. Specifically, these
minimal pairs have been created by manually modifying sentences extracted from
an official online resource maintained by a Qu\'ebec government institution.
Each pair is annotated by twelve Quebec-French native speakers, who select the
sentence they feel is grammatical amongst the two. These annotations are used
to compare the competency of LLMs with that of humans. We evaluate different
LLMs on QFrBLiMP and MultiBLiMP-Fr by observing the rate of higher
probabilities assigned to the sentences of each minimal pair for each category.
We find that while grammatical competence scales with model size, a clear
hierarchy of difficulty emerges. All benchmarked models consistently fail on
phenomena requiring deep semantic understanding, revealing a critical
limitation and a significant gap compared to human performance on these
specific tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基准测试的可靠性对模型评估和科学发展至关重要，当前基准存在反馈循环问题：强基准推动模型发展，好模型需要更具区分度的基准。

Method: 从分布视角研究基准可靠性，引入基准和谐度指标，在19个多项选择基准和5个模型家族上进行实验，将基准映射到和谐度的均值-方差平面上。

Result: 分析显示不和谐的基准会产生误导性结果，总体准确率可能被特定子域不成比例地影响，如ARC-Easy被生物概念问题主导。

Conclusion: 建议在报告准确率的同时报告和谐度，将评估从简单的性能平均值重新定义为更稳健、分布可靠的性能测量。

Abstract: Benchmarks shape scientific conclusions about model capabilities and steer
model development. This creates a feedback loop: stronger benchmarks drive
better models, and better models demand more discriminative benchmarks.
Ensuring benchmark reliability is therefore essential for trustworthy
evaluation and meaningful progress. In this work, we study benchmark
reliability from a distributional perspective and introduce benchmark harmony,
which measures how uniformly a model's performance is distributed across the
subdomains of a benchmark. We posit that high harmony is a desirable benchmark
property, indicating that the aggregate metric reflects uniform competence
across subdomains. Across 19 multiple-choice benchmarks and five model
families, we map each benchmark onto a mean-variance plane of harmony computed
across models, where high mean and low variance signal more reliable
evaluation. Our analysis shows that less harmonious benchmarks can give
misleading results, since overall accuracy may be disproportionately influenced
by specific subdomains. For instance, ARC-Easy is overwhelmed by questions on
Biological Concepts, overshadowing other critical subdomains such as Geography,
Physics, Chemistry, and Environmental Science. By recommending that harmony
should be reported alongside accuracy, we reframe evaluation from simple
performance averages to a more robust, distributionally reliable measurement of
performance.

<details>

Motivation: 现有参数修改去偏方法显著降低文本连贯性和任务准确性，基于提示的去偏方法仅对预定义触发词有效，无法解决模型参数中深度嵌入的刻板印象关联。

Method: 采用双路径遗忘机制，协调刻板印象遗忘与反刻板印象保留，通过对抗性遗忘集和动态数据集交换防止偏见极性反转。

Result: 在多个语言模型和各种评估基准上的实验表明，BiasUnlearn在减轻语言模型偏见方面优于现有方法，同时保留语言建模能力。去偏权重可在模型变体间迁移，证实偏见表示在预训练期间固化并在微调阶段持续存在。

Conclusion: BiasUnlearn框架有效解决了语言模型偏见问题，在去偏的同时保持模型核心能力，且去偏权重具有可迁移性。

Abstract: Many studies have shown various biases targeting different demographic groups
in language models, amplifying discrimination and harming fairness. Recent
parameter modification debiasing approaches significantly degrade core
capabilities such as text coherence and task accuracy. And Prompt-based
debiasing methods, only effective for predefined trigger words, fail to address
deeply embedded stereotypical associations in model parameters. In this paper,
we propose BiasUnlearn, a novel model debiasing framework which achieves
targeted debiasing via dual-pathway unlearning mechanisms coordinating
stereotype forgetting with anti-stereotype retention, while preventing bias
polarity reversal through adversarial forget set and dynamic dataset swapping.
We conducted extensive experiments with multiple language models across various
evaluation benchmarks. The results show that BiasUnlearn outperforms existing
methods in mitigating bias in language models while retaining language modeling
capabilities. Further experiments reveal that debiasing weights are
transferable across model variants, confirming that bias representations become
entrenched during pre-training and persist through fine-tuning phases.

<details>

Motivation: 现有方法依赖传统TopK路由，需要仔细的超参数调优，并为每个令牌分配固定数量的专家，存在局限性。

Method: 用可微分路由函数和闭式解替换不可微分的TopK选择，允许模型自适应确定每层每个令牌激活的专家数量，并引入分析性稀疏控制目标来正则化激活专家数量。

Result: 在Qwen3-1.7B和Llama-3.2-3B模型上的广泛实验表明，LD-MoLE在多样化基准测试中实现了最高的平均分数，优于现有最先进基线。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅实现了优越性能，还展示了学习令牌相关和分层专家分配的能力。

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that combining parameter-efficient fine-tuning
(PEFT) with mixture-of-experts (MoE) is an effective strategy for adapting
large language models (LLMs) to the downstream tasks. However, most existing
approaches rely on conventional TopK routing, which requires careful
hyperparameter tuning and assigns a fixed number of experts to each token. In
this work, we propose LD-MoLE, a Learnable Dynamic routing mechanism for
Mixture of LoRA Experts that enables adaptive, token-dependent, and layer-wise
expert allocation. Our method replaces the non-differentiable TopK selection
with a differentiable routing function and a closed-form solution. Moreover,
our design allows the model to adaptively determine the number of experts to
activate for each token at different layers. In addition, we introduce an
analytical sparsity control objective to regularize the number of activated
experts. Extensive experiments on the Qwen3-1.7B and Llama-3.2-3B models show
that LD-MoLE achieves the highest average scores compared to state-of-the-art
baselines, across a diverse set of benchmarks. Our method not only achieves
superior performance, but also demonstrates the ability to learn
token-dependent and layer-wise expert allocation.

TL;DR: 提出评估数学原子能力的新范式，将数学能力分解为领域特定能力和逻辑能力两个维度，通过实验探索不同原子能力间的相互影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型推理模型主要依赖扩大训练数据规模，但无法确定模型是否真正掌握数学概念和推理原理，还是仅仅记忆训练数据。受人类将复杂问题分解为基本原子能力的启发，需要新的评估方法来理解模型的数学认知能力。

Method: 将数学原子能力分为两个维度：(1) 四大数学领域的特定能力：代数、几何、分析和拓扑；(2) 不同层次的逻辑能力：概念理解、使用形式数学语言的前向多步推理、反例驱动的后向推理。为每个原子能力单元构建相应的训练和评估数据集，并进行广泛实验。

Result: 在先进模型上的评估和实验结果显示，不同原子能力上的表现存在显著差异，原子能力之间存在有趣的相互作用。这些发现为模型认知提供了新的见解。

Conclusion: 将数学智能分解为原子组件具有重要意义，为模型认知提供新视角，并指导训练策略向更高效、可迁移和认知基础的"原子思维"范式发展。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated outstanding performance in
mathematical reasoning capabilities. However, we argue that current large-scale
reasoning models primarily rely on scaling up training datasets with diverse
mathematical problems and long thinking chains, which raises questions about
whether LLMs genuinely acquire mathematical concepts and reasoning principles
or merely remember the training data. In contrast, humans tend to break down
complex problems into multiple fundamental atomic capabilities. Inspired by
this, we propose a new paradigm for evaluating mathematical atomic
capabilities. Our work categorizes atomic abilities into two dimensions: (1)
field-specific abilities across four major mathematical fields, algebra,
geometry, analysis, and topology, and (2) logical abilities at different
levels, including conceptual understanding, forward multi-step reasoning with
formal math language, and counterexample-driven backward reasoning. We propose
corresponding training and evaluation datasets for each atomic capability unit,
and conduct extensive experiments about how different atomic capabilities
influence others, to explore the strategies to elicit the required specific
atomic capability. Evaluation and experimental results on advanced models show
many interesting discoveries and inspirations about the different performances
of models on various atomic capabilities and the interactions between atomic
capabilities. Our findings highlight the importance of decoupling mathematical
intelligence into atomic components, providing new insights into model
cognition and guiding the development of training strategies toward a more
efficient, transferable, and cognitively grounded paradigm of "atomic

### [158] [Controlled Generation for Private Synthetic Text](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25729)
*Zihao Zhao,Anjalie Field*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于去识别化和HIPS理论的隐私保护合成文本生成方法，通过实体感知控制码指导可控生成，在保持隐私保护的同时确保文本实用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在高风险领域（如医疗、社会服务和法律）中负责任地开发和部署AI需要文本匿名化，以保护敏感信息。

Method: 使用实体感知控制码指导可控生成，包括基于上下文学习(ICL)和前缀调优两种变体。ICL确保与底层去识别系统一致的隐私级别，前缀调优采用自定义掩码策略和损失函数支持可扩展的高质量生成。

Result: 在法学和临床数据集上的实验表明，该方法在隐私保护和实用性之间实现了良好平衡。

Conclusion: 该方法为敏感领域的合成文本生成提供了实用有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Text anonymization is essential for responsibly developing and deploying AI
in high-stakes domains such as healthcare, social services, and law. In this
work, we propose a novel methodology for privacy-preserving synthetic text
generation that leverages the principles of de-identification and the Hiding In
Plain Sight (HIPS) theory. Our approach introduces entity-aware control codes
to guide controllable generation using either in-context learning (ICL) or
prefix tuning. The ICL variant ensures privacy levels consistent with the
underlying de-identification system, while the prefix tuning variant
incorporates a custom masking strategy and loss function to support scalable,
high-quality generation. Experiments on legal and clinical datasets demonstrate
that our method achieves a strong balance between privacy protection and
utility, offering a practical and effective solution for synthetic text
generation in sensitive domains.

*Mingyu Chen,Jingkai Lin,Zhaojie Chu,Xiaofen Xing,Yirong Chen,Xiangmin Xu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CATCH框架通过渐进式对话合成和记忆驱动动态规划，显著提升了AI心理咨询的保真度和逻辑连贯性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI心理咨询研究采用一次性生成方法合成多轮对话样本，导致治疗保真度低且无法捕捉每个回应背后的决策逻辑。

Method: 提出CATCH框架：1）渐进式对话合成策略，从客户自述中提取目标、资源和解决方案，组织成结构化大纲，逐步生成阶段对齐的咨询对话；2）记忆驱动动态规划思维模式，整合记忆增强、全局规划和策略推理；3）协作多智能体优化器为每个对话轮次附加显式思维链。

Result: 大量实验和人工评估表明，CATCH显著提升了AI心理咨询的保真度和逻辑连贯性。

Conclusion: CATCH框架有效解决了现有AI心理咨询方法在治疗保真度和决策逻辑透明度方面的局限性。

Abstract: Recently, advancements in AI counseling based on large language models have
shown significant progress. However, existing studies employ a one-time
generation approach to synthesize multi-turn dialogue samples, resulting in low
therapy fidelity and failing to capture the decision-making rationale behind
each response. In this work, we propose CATCH, a novel data synthesis framework
designed to address these challenges. Specifically, to improve therapy
fidelity, we introduce the Progressive Dialogue Synthesis strategy, which
extracts goals, resources, and solutions from a client's self-report, organizes
them into structured outlines, and then incrementally generates stage-aligned
counseling dialogues. To capture decision-making rationale behind each
response, we propose the Memory-Driven Dynamic Planning thinking pattern that
integrates memory enhancement, global planning, and strategy reasoning; a
collaborative multi-agent optimizer then leverages MDP to attach explicit
chain-of-thought to each dialogue turn. Extensive experiments and human
evaluations demonstrate that CATCH significantly enhances fidelity and logical
coherence in AI counseling.

Motivation: 大型语言模型需要大规模高质量的指令遵循和强化数据集，但在专业领域如电信网络故障排除中，人工标注成本高昂且需要深厚技术专长。

Method: 多阶段框架整合检索器、基础生成器和精炼模型，使用领域知识图谱检索文档来合成和增强问答对，采用定制化RAGAS评分过滤低质量样本。

Conclusion: 为专业领域构建指令和强化数据集提供了可扩展的解决方案，在保持高技术保真度的同时显著减少对人工标注的依赖。

Abstract: The success of large language models (LLMs) depends heavily on large-scale,
high-quality instruction-following and reinforcement datasets. However,
generating such data through human annotation is prohibitively time-consuming
particularly for domain-specific tasks like telecom network troubleshooting,
where accurate responses require deep technical expertise and contextual
understanding. In this paper, we present a fully automated, retrieval-augmented
pipeline for generating synthetic question-answer (QA) pairs grounded in
structured domain knowledge. Our multi-stage framework integrates a retriever,
base generator, and refinement model to synthesize and enhance QA pairs using
documents retrieved from a domain-specific knowledge graph. To ensure data
quality, we employ customized RAGAS-based scoring to filter low-quality
samples, producing a high-quality dataset suitable for reinforcement
fine-tuning (RFT). We demonstrate our approach in a real-world telecom scenario
focused on radio access network (RAN) troubleshooting. The resulting pipeline
generates complex, context-rich troubleshooting solution plans without human
intervention. This work offers a scalable solution for building instruction and
reinforcement datasets in specialized domains, significantly reducing
dependence on manual labeling while maintaining high technical fidelity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体中希望语音检测对于促进积极话语和心理健康至关重要，需要开发多语言、细粒度的检测模型来增强积极内容审核和支持性在线社区建设。

Method: 使用基于transformer的XLM-RoBERTa模型，在多语言环境中检测和分类希望语音为三个类别，并在PolyHope数据集上进行评估。

Result: 在PolyHope-M 2025共享任务中取得了竞争性表现，在所有语言上的宏观F1分数显著优于现有最先进技术。

Abstract: The detection of hopeful speech in social media has emerged as a critical
task for promoting positive discourse and well-being. In this paper, we present
a machine learning approach to multiclass hope speech detection across multiple
languages, including English, Urdu, and Spanish. We leverage transformer-based
models, specifically XLM-RoBERTa, to detect and categorize hope speech into
three distinct classes: Generalized Hope, Realistic Hope, and Unrealistic Hope.
Our proposed methodology is evaluated on the PolyHope dataset for the
PolyHope-M 2025 shared task, achieving competitive performance across all
languages. We compare our results with existing models, demonstrating that our
approach significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art techniques in terms
of macro F1 scores. We also discuss the challenges in detecting hope speech in
low-resource languages and the potential for improving generalization. This
work contributes to the development of multilingual, fine-grained hope speech
detection models, which can be applied to enhance positive content moderation
and foster supportive online communities.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TruthRL是一个强化学习框架，通过三元奖励机制直接优化LLMs的真实性，显著减少幻觉并提高真实性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在优化准确性时会放大幻觉，而鼓励弃权的方法又过于保守，两者都损害了真实性

Method: 使用GRPO和三元奖励机制，区分正确答案、幻觉和弃权，激励模型在不确定时弃权以减少幻觉

Result: 在四个知识密集型基准测试中，TruthRL相比普通RL减少28.9%的幻觉，提高21.1%的真实性

Conclusion: TruthRL在准确性和真实性方面都表现出色，证明了学习目标设计对于开发真实LLMs的重要性

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance on
factoid question answering, they are still prone to hallucination and
untruthful responses, particularly when tasks demand information outside their
parametric knowledge. Indeed, truthfulness requires more than accuracy --
models must also recognize uncertainty and abstain when unsure to avoid
hallucinations. This presents a fundamental challenge for existing methods:
approaches that optimize for accuracy often amplify hallucinations, while those
that encourage abstention can become overly conservative, sacrificing correct
answers. Both extremes ultimately compromise truthfulness. In this work, we
present TruthRL, a general reinforcement learning (RL) framework that directly
optimizes the truthfulness of LLMs. Specifically, we implement TruthRL using
GRPO with a simple yet effective ternary reward that distinguishes correct
answers, hallucinations, and abstentions. It incentivizes models to reduce
hallucinations not only by providing correct responses, but also by enabling
abstention when uncertain, thereby improving truthfulness. Extensive
experiments across four knowledge-intensive benchmarks show that, compared to
vanilla RL, TruthRL significantly reduces hallucinations by 28.9% and improves
truthfulness by 21.1%, with consistent gains across various backbone models
(e.g., Qwen, Llama) under both retrieval and non-retrieval setups. In-depth
ablation study demonstrates that vanilla accuracy-driven methods, such as
supervised fine-tuning or RL with a binary reward, struggle to balance factual
correctness and uncertainty. In contrast, our proposed truthfulness-driven
TruthRL achieves strong performance in both accuracy and truthfulness,
underscoring the importance of learning objective design for developing
truthful LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文研究了基于语言模型的自动抑郁检测中的算法偏见，重点关注性别和种族/民族方面的社会人口统计学差异。比较了基于深度神经网络嵌入的模型与使用大语言模型的少样本学习方法，评估了它们在DAIC-WOZ临床访谈数据集上的性能和公平性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是解决语言模型在抑郁检测中存在的算法偏见问题，特别是针对不同性别和种族/民族群体的公平性差异，这对于确保心理健康评估工具的公平应用至关重要。

Method: 使用深度神经网络嵌入模型与大语言模型少样本学习方法进行对比。为缓解偏见，对DNN模型应用公平感知损失函数，对LLMs探索不同提示框架和样本数量的上下文学习。

Result: 结果显示LLMs在抑郁分类中优于DNN模型，特别是在西班牙裔等代表性不足群体中表现更好。LLMs的性别偏见比DNN模型少，但种族差异仍然存在。在DNN模型中，最差组损失方法在性能和公平性之间取得了更好的平衡。

Conclusion: LLMs在抑郁检测中表现更优且性别偏见较少，但种族偏见问题仍然存在。最差组损失是缓解DNN模型偏见的有效方法，而增加样本数量或提示策略对减少种族差异效果有限。

Abstract: This paper investigates algorithmic bias in language-based models for
automated depression detection, focusing on socio-demographic disparities
related to gender and race/ethnicity. Models trained using deep neural networks
(DNN) based embeddings are compared to few-shot learning approaches with large
language models (LLMs), evaluating both performance and fairness on clinical
interview transcripts from the Distress Analysis Interview Corpus/Wizard-of-Oz
(DAIC-WOZ). To mitigate bias, fairness-aware loss functions are applied to
DNN-based models, while in-context learning with varied prompt framing and shot
counts is explored for LLMs. Results indicate that LLMs outperform DNN-based
models in depression classification, particularly for underrepresented groups
such as Hispanic participants. LLMs also exhibit reduced gender bias compared
to DNN-based embeddings, though racial disparities persist. Among
fairness-aware techniques for mitigating bias in DNN-based embeddings, the
worst-group loss, which is designed to minimize loss for the worst-performing
demographic group, achieves a better balance between performance and fairness.
In contrast, the fairness-regularized loss minimizes loss across all groups but
performs less effectively. In LLMs, guided prompting with ethical framing helps
mitigate gender bias in the 1-shot setting. However, increasing the number of
shots does not lead to further reductions in disparities. For race/ethnicity,
neither prompting strategy nor increasing $N$ in $N$-shot learning effectively
reduces disparities.

Abstract: In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant
potential across various natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However,
their performance in domain-specific applications and non-English languages

  We benchmark several popular LLMs, analyzing their accuracy, reasoning
patterns, and ability to understand domain-specific terminology and linguistic
nuances. Additionally, we perform comprehensive experiments to evaluate the
impact of prompt engineering, fine-tuning, and other optimization techniques on
model performance. Our findings highlight both the strengths and limitations of
current LLMs in handling specialized knowledge tasks in low-resource languages,

Conclusion: ReTAG框架有效解决了全局语义理解中的关键挑战，为问答系统提供了更高效的解决方案

Abstract: Recent advances in question answering have led to substantial progress in
tasks such as multi-hop reasoning. However, global sensemaking-answering
questions by synthesizing information from an entire corpus remains a
significant challenge. A prior graph-based approach to global sensemaking lacks
retrieval mechanisms, topic specificity, and incurs high inference costs. To
address these limitations, we propose ReTAG, a Retrieval-Enhanced,
Topic-Augmented Graph framework that constructs topic-specific subgraphs and
retrieves the relevant summaries for response generation. Experiments show that
ReTAG improves response quality while significantly reducing inference time
compared to the baseline. Our code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于RLVR的大模型存在"过度思考"问题，生成过长的推理路径却没有性能提升。现有的长度惩罚方法由于轨迹级奖励与token级优化的不匹配而失败

Method: 提出DECS框架，包含：(1) 首个解耦的token级奖励机制，精确惩罚冗余token；(2) 新颖的课程批量调度策略，平衡效率与效果

Result: 在7个基准测试中，推理token数量减少超过50%，同时保持甚至提升了模型性能

Conclusion: DECS证明可以在不损害模型推理能力的前提下，显著提升推理效率

Abstract: While large reasoning models trained with critic-free reinforcement learning
and verifiable rewards (RLVR) represent the state-of-the-art, their practical
utility is hampered by ``overthinking'', a critical issue where models generate
excessively long reasoning paths without any performance benefit. Existing
solutions that penalize length often fail, inducing performance degradation due
to a fundamental misalignment between trajectory-level rewards and token-level
optimization. In this work, we introduce a novel framework, DECS, built on our
theoretical discovery of two previously unaddressed flaws in current length
rewards: (1) the erroneous penalization of essential exploratory tokens and (2)
the inadvertent rewarding of partial redundancy. Our framework's innovations
include (i) a first-of-its-kind decoupled token-level reward mechanism that
surgically distinguishes and penalizes redundant tokens, and (ii) a novel
curriculum batch scheduling strategy to master the efficiency-efficacy
equilibrium. Experimental results show DECS can achieve a dramatic reduction in
reasoning tokens by over 50\% across seven benchmarks while simultaneously
maintaining or even improving performance. It demonstrates conclusively that
substantial gains in reasoning efficiency can be achieved without compromising
a model's underlying reasoning power.

TL;DR: 本文提出两种视觉语言模型解释质量评分函数：视觉保真度和对比性，用于评估VLM生成解释的可靠性，并通过用户研究证明这些评分能帮助用户更准确地判断VLM预测的正确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当用户无法看到视觉上下文时（如视障用户），VLM预测的自然语言解释可以帮助判断预测可靠性，但现有解释容易让用户过度依赖不准确的预测，需要解决这一问题。

Method: 提出两种解释质量评分函数：视觉保真度（衡量解释对视觉上下文的忠实度）和对比性（衡量解释区分模型预测与替代方案的能力），并在A-OKVQA和VizWiz任务上进行评估。

Result: 在A-OKVQA和VizWiz任务上，提出的质量评分函数比现有解释质量指标与模型正确性更相关。用户研究表明，显示质量评分可将用户预测VLM正确性的准确率提高11.1%，错误相信不正确预测的比例降低15.4%。

Conclusion: 解释质量评分有助于促进对VLM预测的适当依赖，特别是在用户无法查看视觉上下文的情况下，能有效减少对错误预测的过度信任。

Abstract: When people query Vision-Language Models (VLMs) but cannot see the
accompanying visual context (e.g. for blind and low-vision users), augmenting
VLM predictions with natural language explanations can signal which model
predictions are reliable. However, prior work has found that explanations can
easily convince users that inaccurate VLM predictions are correct. To remedy
undesirable overreliance on VLM predictions, we propose evaluating two
complementary qualities of VLM-generated explanations via two quality scoring
functions. We propose Visual Fidelity, which captures how faithful an
explanation is to the visual context, and Contrastiveness, which captures how
well the explanation identifies visual details that distinguish the model's
prediction from plausible alternatives. On the A-OKVQA and VizWiz tasks, these
quality scoring functions are better calibrated with model correctness than
existing explanation qualities. We conduct a user study in which participants
have to decide whether a VLM prediction is accurate without viewing its visual
context. We observe that showing our quality scores alongside VLM explanations
improves participants' accuracy at predicting VLM correctness by 11.1%,
including a 15.4% reduction in the rate of falsely believing incorrect
predictions. These findings highlight the utility of explanation quality scores
in fostering appropriate reliance on VLM predictions.

multi-stage evaluation: (1) confabulation detection, (2) fine-grained error
localization, and (3) correction. We benchmark 9 state-of-the-art LLMs,
revealing limited performance ($\sim$50\% accuracy). Even top models such as
GPT-4o fail to distinguish factual from confabulated scientific answers,
raising concerns about the reliability of \textit{LLM-as-judge} evaluation

TL;DR: 提出了RoleConflictBench基准测试，用于评估大语言模型在角色冲突这种复杂社会困境中的情境敏感性，发现LLMs虽然对情境线索有一定反应能力，但决策主要受社会角色固有偏见主导。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在人类决策中的影响力增加，需要理解它们在复杂社会情境中的行为。角色冲突代表固有的模糊社会困境，需要情境敏感性来识别和权衡可能根本改变决策优先级的情境线索。

Method: 使用三阶段流程生成超过13K个现实角色冲突场景，涵盖65个角色，系统性地变化相关期望（责任和义务）和情境紧急程度，分析10个不同LLMs的模型选择。

Result: LLMs对情境线索的反应能力不足，决策主要由强大的固有偏见主导，偏好家庭和职业领域角色，明显优先考虑男性角色和亚伯拉罕宗教。

Conclusion: LLMs在复杂社会困境中的情境敏感性不足，其决策受社会角色固有偏见主导，需要进一步改进模型的社会推理能力。

Abstract: Humans often encounter role conflicts -- social dilemmas where the
expectations of multiple roles clash and cannot be simultaneously fulfilled. As
large language models (LLMs) become increasingly influential in human
decision-making, understanding how they behave in complex social situations is
essential. While previous research has evaluated LLMs' social abilities in
contexts with predefined correct answers, role conflicts represent inherently
ambiguous social dilemmas that require contextual sensitivity: the ability to
recognize and appropriately weigh situational cues that can fundamentally alter
decision priorities. To address this gap, we introduce RoleConflictBench, a
novel benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs' contextual sensitivity in complex
social dilemmas. Our benchmark employs a three-stage pipeline to generate over
13K realistic role conflict scenarios across 65 roles, systematically varying
their associated expectations (i.e., their responsibilities and obligations)
and situational urgency levels. By analyzing model choices across 10 different
LLMs, we find that while LLMs show some capacity to respond to these contextual
cues, this sensitivity is insufficient. Instead, their decisions are
predominantly governed by a powerful, inherent bias related to social roles
rather than situational information. Our analysis quantifies these biases,
revealing a dominant preference for roles within the Family and Occupation
domains, as well as a clear prioritization of male roles and Abrahamic
religions across most evaluatee models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于缺乏评估文本特定方面（如个性化质量）的指标，研究者通常依赖多个大语言模型进行元评估，这会因模型内部偏见而增加成本。

Method: 开发了名为PerQ的计算高效方法，用于评估语言模型生成文本的个性化质量。

Result: 通过大型和小型语言模型生成能力的案例研究，证明了PerQ指标在研究中的实用性。

Conclusion: PerQ方法能够有效减少资源浪费，为文本个性化质量评估提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Since no metrics are available to evaluate specific aspects of a text, such
as its personalization quality, the researchers often rely solely on large
language models to meta-evaluate such texts. Due to internal biases of
individual language models, it is recommended to use multiple of them for
combined evaluation, which directly increases costs of such meta-evaluation. In
this paper, a computationally efficient method for evaluation of
personalization quality of a given text (generated by a language model) is

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Mem-alpha是一个强化学习框架，通过训练LLM代理有效管理复杂内存系统，解决现有内存增强代理在信息存储、结构化和更新方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于预定义指令和工具的内存增强代理在决定存储哪些信息、如何结构化以及何时更新方面存在困难，导致内存构建不理想和信息丢失。

Method: 提出Mem-alpha强化学习框架，构建专门训练数据集，训练代理处理顺序信息块，学习提取和存储相关内容并更新内存系统。奖励信号来自下游问答准确性。

Result: Mem-alpha在现有内存增强代理基准上取得显著改进，尽管仅在30k token最大长度的实例上训练，但能泛化到超过400k token的序列，超过训练长度的13倍。

Conclusion: Mem-alpha框架展示了强大的鲁棒性和泛化能力，能够有效训练代理管理复杂内存系统。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents are constrained by limited context windows,
necessitating external memory systems for long-term information understanding.
Current memory-augmented agents typically depend on pre-defined instructions
and tools for memory updates. However, language models may lack the ability to
determine which information to store, how to structure it, and when to update
it, especially as memory systems become more complex. This results in
suboptimal memory construction and information loss. To this end, we propose
Mem-alpha, a reinforcement learning framework that trains agents to effectively
manage complex memory systems through interaction and feedback. We also
construct a specialized training dataset spanning diverse multi-turn
interaction patterns paired with comprehensive evaluation questions designed to
teach effective memory management. During training, agents process sequential
information chunks, learn to extract and store relevant content, then update
the memory system. The reward signal derives from downstream question-answering
accuracy over the full interaction history, directly optimizing for memory
construction. To illustrate the effectiveness of our training framework, we
design a memory architecture comprising core, episodic, and semantic
components, equipped with multiple tools for memory operations. Empirical
evaluation demonstrates that Mem-alpha achieves significant improvements over
existing memory-augmented agent baselines. Despite being trained exclusively on
instances with a maximum length of 30k tokens, our agents exhibit remarkable
generalization to sequences exceeding 400k tokens, over 13x the training
length, highlighting the robustness of Mem-alpha.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的MoE路由器函数KERN，基于Nadaraya-Watson回归的数学框架，替代传统的Softmax路由器，无需额外成本且能泛化Sigmoid和Softmax路由器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统MoE模型一直使用Softmax作为路由器函数，但这种选择是未经挑战的假设而非原则性设计。作者发现MoE与Nadaraya-Watson回归具有相同数学公式，FFN和MoE都可视为其特例。

Method: 提出零额外成本的KERN路由器函数，采用FFN风格设计，推荐使用ReLU激活和ℓ2归一化。该方法基于Nadaraya-Watson回归框架，将MoE重新解释为核回归问题。

Result: 在MoE和LLM上的综合实验验证了所提FFN风格路由器函数的有效性。

Conclusion: KERN路由器为MoE提供了一种有原则的替代方案，能够替代传统的Softmax路由器，且无需额外计算成本。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has become a cornerstone in recent state-of-the-art
large language models (LLMs). Traditionally, MoE relies on $\mathrm{Softmax}$
as the router score function to aggregate expert output, a designed choice that
has persisted from the earliest MoE models to modern LLMs, and is now widely
regarded as standard practice. However, the necessity of using
$\mathrm{Softmax}$ to project router weights into a probability simplex remains
an unchallenged assumption rather than a principled design choice. In this
work, we first revisit the classical Nadaraya-Watson regression and observe
that MoE shares the same mathematical formulation as Nadaraya-Watson
regression. Furthermore, we show that both feed-forward neural network (FFN)
and MoE can be interpreted as a special case of Nadaraya-Watson regression,
where the kernel function corresponds to the input neurons of the output layer.
Motivated by these insights, we propose the \textbf{zero-additional-cost}
Kernel Inspired Router with Normalization (KERN), an FFN-style router function,
as an alternative to $\mathrm{Softmax}$. We demonstrate that this router
generalizes both $\mathrm{Sigmoid}$- and $\mathrm{Softmax}$-based routers.
\textbf{Based on empirical observations and established practices in FFN
implementation, we recommend the use of $\mathrm{ReLU}$ activation and
$\ell_2$-normalization in $\mathrm{KERN}$ router function.} Comprehensive
experiments in MoE and LLM validate the effectiveness of the proposed FFN-style
router function \methodNorm.

*Ana Ezquerro,Carlos Gómez-Rodríguez,David Vilares*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了多种替代架构（如xLSTMs、结构化状态空间模型、扩散模型和对抗学习）在序列标注任务中的适应性，发现这些模型在简单设置中的优异表现不能很好地泛化到跨语言或更复杂的结构化任务中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然预训练Transformer编码器在序列标注中占主导地位，但其他架构在语言建模中显示出潜力，却很少应用于序列标注任务，特别是在复杂任务中。

Method: 研究了多种替代架构（xLSTMs、结构化状态空间模型、扩散模型、对抗学习）在不同结构复杂性、标签空间和标记依赖性的标注任务中的适应性，并进行了跨语言评估。

Result: 发现在简单设置中观察到的强性能不能很好地跨语言或数据集泛化，也不能扩展到更复杂的结构化任务。

Conclusion: 替代架构在序列标注任务中的表现受任务复杂性和语言多样性的影响，需要更全面的评估来理解其适用性。

Abstract: Pretrained Transformer encoders are the dominant approach to sequence
labeling. While some alternative architectures-such as xLSTMs, structured
state-space models, diffusion models, and adversarial learning-have shown
promise in language modeling, few have been applied to sequence labeling, and
mostly on flat or simplified tasks. We study how these architectures adapt
across tagging tasks that vary in structural complexity, label space, and token
dependencies, with evaluation spanning multiple languages. We find that the
strong performance previously observed in simpler settings does not always
generalize well across languages or datasets, nor does it extend to more
complex structured tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的无参考GEC评估指标虽然与人工评判有高相关性，但未考虑对抗性系统的存在。这些系统可能通过不正当手段获取高分，误导用户选择GEC系统，损害自动评估的可靠性。

Method: 针对SOME、Scribendi、IMPARA和基于LLM的四种无参考指标，设计了专门的对抗攻击策略，构建能够欺骗这些评估指标的对抗系统。

Result: 实验表明，所提出的对抗系统在欺骗现有评估指标方面表现优于当前最先进方法，成功暴露了这些指标的脆弱性。

Conclusion: 研究结果强调了开发更鲁棒的GEC评估方法的必要性，当前的无参考评估指标在面对精心设计的对抗攻击时缺乏足够的防御能力。

Abstract: Reference-free evaluation metrics for grammatical error correction (GEC) have
achieved high correlation with human judgments. However, these metrics are not
designed to evaluate adversarial systems that aim to obtain unjustifiably high
scores. The existence of such systems undermines the reliability of automatic
evaluation, as it can mislead users in selecting appropriate GEC systems. In
this study, we propose adversarial attack strategies for four reference-free
metrics: SOME, Scribendi, IMPARA, and LLM-based metrics, and demonstrate that
our adversarial systems outperform the current state-of-the-art. These findings
highlight the need for more robust evaluation methods.

TL;DR: 提出了一个统一的回归语言模型(RLM)，能够直接从代码文本预测多种执行指标，包括内存占用、GPU内核延迟和神经网络性能，无需复杂的特征工程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决代码到指标回归的挑战性任务，传统方法需要大量领域特定的特征工程，而本文旨在通过单一统一模型处理多种编程语言和硬件平台的性能预测。

Method: 使用基于T5Gemma初始化的300M参数回归语言模型(RLM)，直接从代码文本预测数值结果，支持多种编程语言和硬件平台。

Result: 在APPS竞争编程提交上获得>0.9的Spearman秩相关系数，在CodeNet的17种语言上平均Spearman秩>0.5，在五个经典NAS设计空间上获得最高0.46的Kendall-Tau系数。

Conclusion: 统一的回归语言模型能够有效预测代码执行的各种数值指标，在多个任务和平台上表现出色，超越了传统图神经网络方法。

Abstract: We study code-to-metric regression: predicting numeric outcomes of code
executions, a challenging task due to the open-ended nature of programming
languages. While prior methods have resorted to heavy and domain-specific
feature engineering, we show that a single unified Regression Language Model
(RLM) can simultaneously predict directly from text, (i) the memory footprint
of code across multiple high-level languages such as Python and C++, (ii) the
latency of Triton GPU kernels, and (iii) the accuracy and speed of trained
neural networks represented in ONNX. In particular, a relatively small 300M
parameter RLM initialized from T5Gemma, obtains > 0.9 Spearman-rank on
competitive programming submissions from APPS, and a single unified model
achieves > 0.5 average Spearman-rank across 17 separate languages from CodeNet.
Furthermore, the RLM can obtain the highest average Kendall-Tau of 0.46 on five
classic NAS design spaces previously dominated by graph neural networks, and
simultaneously predict architecture latencies on numerous hardware platforms.

Motivation: 现有奖励模型基于通用偏好数据训练，在RAG场景中难以准确评估回答的忠实性、相关性、拒绝能力、完整性和简洁性，缺乏专门的RAG偏好数据集和模型

Method: 开发RAGferee方法，将问答数据集重新构建为偏好对，强调基于上下文的准确性而非风格特征，训练参数规模从7B到24B的专门RAG奖励模型

Result: 仅用4K样本训练的小型模型在ContextualJudgeBench上达到最先进性能，超越基于2.4M样本训练的70B+通用模型，绝对提升15.5%

Conclusion: RAGferee方法能有效创建专门的RAG偏好数据集，训练的小型专业化模型在RAG评估任务上优于大型通用模型，证明了专业化训练的重要性

Abstract: Existing Reward Models (RMs), typically trained on general preference data,
struggle in Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) settings, which require
judging responses for faithfulness to retrieved context, relevance to the user
query, appropriate refusals when context is insufficient, completeness and
conciseness of information. To address the lack of publicly available
RAG-centric preference datasets and specialised RMs, we introduce RAGferee, a
methodology that repurposes question-answering (QA) datasets into preference
pairs that prioritise groundedness over stylistic features, enabling the
training of contextual RMs better suited to judging RAG responses. Using
RAGferee, we curate a small preference dataset of 4K samples and fine-tune RMs
ranging from 7B to 24B parameters. Our RAG-centric RMs achieve state-of-the-art
performance on ContextualJudgeBench, surpassing existing 70B+ RMs trained on
much larger (up to 2.4M samples) general corpora, with an absolute improvement
of +15.5%.

TL;DR: 提出了RE²方法，通过语法错误解释而非文本相似度来检索参考示例，提升中文语法错误纠正性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要依赖文本相似度检索示例，但这种方法经常与实际的错误模式不匹配，检索到词汇相似但语法无关的句子

Method: RE²方法使用语法错误解释来选择参考示例，创建了高质量的语法错误解释数据集，并用这些解释来指导LLMs进行CGEC

Result: 在两个CGEC数据集上的实验结果表明，该方法有效提升了中文语法错误纠正的性能

Conclusion: 基于语法错误解释的示例检索方法比基于文本相似度的方法更有效，提出的GEE数据集对CGEC和GEE领域都有价值

Abstract: The primary objective of Chinese grammatical error correction (CGEC) is to
detect and correct errors in Chinese sentences. Recent research shows that
large language models (LLMs) have been applied to CGEC with significant
results. For LLMs, selecting appropriate reference examples can help improve
their performance. However, existing methods predominantly rely on text
similarity for example retrieval, a strategy that frequently mismatches actual
error patterns and retrieves lexically similar yet grammatically irrelevant
sentences. To address this problem, we propose a method named RE$^2$, which
retrieves appropriate examples with explanations of grammatical errors. Instead
of using text similarity of the input sentence, we use explanations of
grammatical errors to select reference examples, which are used by LLMs to
improve the performance of CGEC. We conduct experiments on two CGEC datasets
and create a high-quality grammatical error explanation (GEE) dataset, which is
not only used in our research but also serves as a valuable resource for future
studies in both CGEC and GEE. The experimental results on the two datasets
indicate that our proposed method effectively improves the performance of CGEC.

TL;DR: 本研究通过控制提示中的线索操作，系统评估了大型语言模型在思维链提示下的忠实性，发现模型推理会受到线索捷径的系统性影响，从而影响忠实性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估思维链生成的推理过程在多大程度上忠实于底层计算，而非受提示中隐含答案捷径影响的叙述性解释。

Method: 在四个数据集(AIME、GSM-Hard、MATH-500、UniADILR)上使用GPT-4o和Gemini-2-Flash模型，通过控制线索的正确性、呈现风格和复杂度进行系统实验。

Result: 正确线索显著提高准确性，错误线索降低准确性；方程线索常被明确引用，原始线索常被默默采用；奉承提示鼓励明确承认，泄露提示促进隐藏依赖。

Conclusion: LLM推理受到线索捷径的系统性影响，这种影响会掩盖推理过程的忠实性，呈现风格会影响模型对线索依赖的显性表达。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly rely on chain-of-thought (CoT)
prompting to solve mathematical and logical reasoning tasks. Yet, a central
question remains: to what extent are these generated rationales \emph{faithful}
to the underlying computations, rather than post-hoc narratives shaped by hints
that function as answer shortcuts embedded in the prompt? Following prior work
on hinted vs.\ unhinted prompting, we present a systematic study of CoT
faithfulness under controlled hint manipulations. Our experimental design spans
four datasets (AIME, GSM-Hard, MATH-500, UniADILR), two state-of-the-art models
(GPT-4o and Gemini-2-Flash), and a structured set of hint conditions varying in
correctness (correct and incorrect), presentation style (sycophancy and data
leak), and complexity (raw answers, two-operator expressions, four-operator
expressions). We evaluate both task accuracy and whether hints are explicitly
acknowledged in the reasoning. Our results reveal three key findings. First,
correct hints substantially improve accuracy, especially on harder benchmarks
and logical reasoning, while incorrect hints sharply reduce accuracy in tasks
with lower baseline competence. Second, acknowledgement of hints is highly
uneven: equation-based hints are frequently referenced, whereas raw hints are
often adopted silently, indicating that more complex hints push models toward
verbalizing their reliance in the reasoning process. Third, presentation style
matters: sycophancy prompts encourage overt acknowledgement, while leak-style
prompts increase accuracy but promote hidden reliance. This may reflect
RLHF-related effects, as sycophancy exploits the human-pleasing side and data
leak triggers the self-censoring side. Together, these results demonstrate that
LLM reasoning is systematically shaped by shortcuts in ways that obscure
faithfulness.

TL;DR: 提出了RE-Searcher方法，通过目标导向规划和自我反思来增强LLM在复杂搜索环境中的鲁棒性，解决查询变化导致的脆弱搜索行为问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在知识密集型问答中表现优异，但受限于知识截止、幻觉和交互模式限制。虽然外部搜索工具可以缓解这些问题，但复杂搜索环境中查询的微小变化会引导推理进入无效路径并放大错误。

Method: 提出RE-Searcher方法，在搜索过程中明确阐述具体搜索目标，然后反思检索到的证据是否满足该目标，结合目标导向规划和自我反思来抵抗复杂环境中的虚假线索。

Result: 实验表明该方法提高了搜索准确性并达到最先进结果，扰动研究进一步证明了对噪声或误导性外部信号的强大韧性，减轻了搜索过程的脆弱性。

Conclusion: 这些发现为将LLM驱动的智能体集成到更复杂的交互环境并实现更自主的决策提供了实用指导。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at knowledge-intensive question answering
and reasoning, yet their real-world deployment remains constrained by knowledge
cutoff, hallucination, and limited interaction modalities. Augmenting LLMs with
external search tools helps alleviate these issues, but it also exposes agents
to a complex search environment in which small, plausible variations in query
formulation can steer reasoning into unproductive trajectories and amplify
errors. We present a systematic analysis that quantifies how environmental
complexity induces fragile search behaviors and, in turn, degrades overall
performance. To address this challenge, we propose a simple yet effective
approach to instantiate a search agent, RE-Searcher. During search, RE-Searcher
explicitly articulates a concrete search goal and subsequently reflects on
whether the retrieved evidence satisfies that goal. This combination of
goal-oriented planning and self-reflection enables RE-Searcher to resist
spurious cues in complex search environments and perform robust search.
Extensive experiments show that our method improves search accuracy and
achieves state-of-the-art results. Perturbation studies further demonstrate
substantial resilience to noisy or misleading external signals, mitigating the
fragility of the search process. We believe these findings offer practical
guidance for integrating LLM-powered agents into more complex interactive
environments and enabling more autonomous decision-making.

Motivation: 现有机器生成文本检测研究主要关注英语，对中欧语言的检测能力缺乏探索，需要填补这一空白并评估跨语言迁移效果。

Method: 构建了多领域、多生成器、多语言的基准测试，比较不同训练语言组合的性能，并评估检测方法的对抗鲁棒性。

Result: 监督微调的检测器在中欧语言中表现最优，同时对混淆攻击具有最强的抵抗能力。

Conclusion: 针对特定语言进行监督微调的检测器在中欧语言机器生成文本检测中效果最好，且对抗攻击鲁棒性最强。

Abstract: Machine-generated text detection, as an important task, is predominantly
focused on English in research. This makes the existing detectors almost
unusable for non-English languages, relying purely on cross-lingual
transferability. There exist only a few works focused on any of Central
European languages, leaving the transferability towards these languages rather
unexplored. We fill this gap by providing the first benchmark of detection
methods focused on this region, while also providing comparison of
train-languages combinations to identify the best performing ones. We focus on
multi-domain, multi-generator, and multilingual evaluation, pinpointing the
differences of individual aspects, as well as adversarial robustness of
detection methods. Supervised finetuned detectors in the Central European
languages are found the most performant in these languages as well as the most
resistant against obfuscation.

TL;DR: DyFlow是一个动态工作流生成框架，通过自适应构建和调整推理过程来提升跨任务泛化能力，显著优于现有基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的智能体系统大多依赖手动设计的工作流程，限制了跨任务适应性。虽然少数方法尝试自动生成工作流，但通常与特定数据集或查询类型绑定，且对中间反馈利用不足，导致系统鲁棒性和推理深度受限。

Method: DyFlow包含两个核心组件：设计器将复杂问题分解为子目标序列，基于中间输出和反馈动态规划下一步；执行器使用具有上下文感知参数化的动态操作符执行每个操作，实现灵活且语义基础的推理。

Result: 在社交推理、生物医学任务、数学问题解决和代码生成等多个领域评估显示，DyFlow显著优于现有基线，实现了显著的Pass@k提升，并在不同领域展现出强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: DyFlow通过动态工作流生成有效解决了现有方法的局限性，为构建高效且可泛化的LLM智能体系统提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: Agent systems based on large language models (LLMs) have shown great
potential in complex reasoning tasks, but building efficient and generalizable
workflows remains a major challenge. Most existing approaches rely on manually
designed processes, which limits their adaptability across different tasks.
While a few methods attempt automated workflow generation, they are often tied
to specific datasets or query types and make limited use of intermediate
feedback, reducing system robustness and reasoning depth. Moreover, their
operations are typically predefined and inflexible. To address these
limitations, we propose DyFlow, a dynamic workflow generation framework that
adaptively constructs and adjusts reasoning procedures based on task
requirements and real-time intermediate feedback, thereby enhancing cross-task
generalization. DyFlow consists of two core components: a designer and an
executor. The designer decomposes complex problems into a sequence of sub-goals
defined by high-level objectives and dynamically plans the next steps based on
intermediate outputs and feedback. These plans are then carried out by the
executor, which executes each operation using dynamic operators with
context-aware parameterization, enabling flexible and semantically grounded
reasoning. We systematically evaluate DyFlow across diverse domains, including
social reasoning, biomedical tasks, mathematical problem solving, and code
generation. Results demonstrate that DyFlow significantly outperforms existing
baselines, achieving substantial Pass@k improvements and exhibiting robust
generalization across diverse domains. The code is publicly available at

TL;DR: LLM作为自动评估器存在偏见问题，会基于提示中的表面线索（如来源身份和时间）而非内容质量做出判断，且很少承认这些偏见因素。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLM作为自动评估器在实际应用中的可靠性问题，发现其判断可能基于非内容相关的表面线索而非真实质量。

Method: 使用ELI5和LitBench两个数据集，构建100对比较任务，给回答添加来源身份（人类、专家、LLM、未知）和时间（1950年vs2025年）的表面线索，使用GPT-4o和Gemini-2.5-Flash作为评估器。

Result: 两个模型都表现出明显的时间偏见（偏向新回答）和来源等级偏见（专家>人类>LLM>未知），GPT-4o在主观性强的LitBench领域偏见更明显，且几乎从不承认这些偏见因素。

Conclusion: 当前LLM作为评估器的系统容易受到表面线索影响且不忠实，在研究和实际部署中的可靠性受到质疑。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as automatic judges to
evaluate system outputs in tasks such as summarization, dialogue, and creative
writing. A faithful judge should base its verdicts solely on response quality
and explicitly acknowledge the factors shaping its decision. We show that
current LLM judges fail on both counts by relying on shortcuts introduced in
the prompt. Our study uses two evaluation datasets: ELI5, a benchmark for
long-form question answering, and LitBench, a recent benchmark for creative
writing. Both datasets provide pairwise comparisons, where the evaluator must
choose which of two responses is better. From each dataset we construct 100
pairwise judgment tasks and employ two widely used models, GPT-4o and
Gemini-2.5-Flash, as evaluators in the role of LLM-as-a-judge. For each pair,
we assign superficial cues to the responses, provenance cues indicating source
identity (Human, Expert, LLM, or Unknown) and recency cues indicating temporal
origin (Old, 1950 vs. New, 2025), while keeping the rest of the prompt fixed.
Results reveal consistent verdict shifts: both models exhibit a strong recency
bias, systematically favoring new responses over old, as well as a clear
provenance hierarchy (Expert > Human > LLM > Unknown). These biases are
especially pronounced in GPT-4o and in the more subjective and open-ended
LitBench domain. Crucially, cue acknowledgment is rare: justifications almost
never reference the injected cues, instead rationalizing decisions in terms of
content qualities. These findings demonstrate that current LLM-as-a-judge
systems are shortcut-prone and unfaithful, undermining their reliability as
evaluators in both research and deployment.

TL;DR: 提出LENS框架，直接在LLM的潜在嵌入空间中合成偏好数据，通过VAE学习响应嵌入的结构化潜在表示，在潜在空间中进行受控扰动来生成多样化的合成偏好对，显著提高奖励建模效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本数据合成方法计算成本高，限制了奖励建模的发展。需要一种更高效的方法来生成偏好数据，以降低对齐大型语言模型与人类偏好的成本。

Method: 使用变分自编码器(VAE)学习响应嵌入的结构化潜在表示，在潜在空间中进行受控扰动，然后将扰动后的表示解码回嵌入空间，生成语义一致的合成偏好对，避免了昂贵的文本生成和标注过程。

Result: 在标准基准测试中，潜在空间合成方法显著优于基于文本的增强方法，生成速度快18倍，使用的模型小16,000倍，同时实现了更优的结果。

Conclusion: LENS框架为通过高效数据增强来改进奖励建模提供了一种可扩展且有效的替代方案，大大降低了偏好数据合成的计算成本。

Abstract: Reward modeling, crucial for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human
preferences, is often bottlenecked by the high cost of preference data.
Existing textual data synthesis methods are computationally expensive. We
propose a novel framework LENS for synthesizing preference data directly in the
LLM's latent embedding space. Our method employs a Variational Autoencoder
(VAE) to learn a structured latent representation of response embeddings. By
performing controlled perturbations in this latent space and decoding back to
the embedding space, we efficiently generate diverse, semantically consistent
synthetic preference pairs, bypassing costly text generation and annotation. We
provide theoretical guarantees that our synthesized pairs approximately
preserve original preference ordering and improve reward model generalization.
Empirically, our latent-space synthesis significantly outperforms text-based
augmentation on standard benchmarks, achieving superior results while being 18x
faster in generation and using a 16,000x smaller model. Our work offers a
scalable and effective alternative for enhancing reward modeling through
efficient data augmentation. Code is publicly available at

Motivation: 现有数学基准仅限于最终答案问题或高中竞赛题，无法评估模型在研究级数学任务上的表现，需要开发更贴近真实研究环境的评估框架。

Method: 创建包含39个同行评议数学问题的私有基准，每个问题需要详细证明并配有子问题；采用代理框架评估，允许模型使用网络搜索和数学软件工具。

Result: 当前LLM在较易的研究级问题上表现良好，但在更具挑战性的问题上仍有困难。Grok-4在最终答案子问题上准确率52%，GPT-5在证明生成上表现最佳，22%的问题获得完全正确解。

Conclusion: IMProofBench将作为动态基准持续发展，通过与数学界合作确保其相关性，用于评估下一代LLM的数学推理能力。

Abstract: As the mathematical capabilities of large language models (LLMs) improve, it
becomes increasingly important to evaluate their performance on research-level
tasks at the frontier of mathematical knowledge. However, existing benchmarks
are limited, as they focus solely on final-answer questions or high-school
competition problems. To address this gap, we introduce IMProofBench, a private
benchmark consisting of 39 peer-reviewed problems developed by expert
mathematicians. Each problem requires a detailed proof and is paired with
subproblems that have final answers, supporting both an evaluation of
mathematical reasoning capabilities by human experts and a large-scale
quantitative analysis through automated grading. Furthermore, unlike prior
benchmarks, the evaluation setup simulates a realistic research environment:
models operate in an agentic framework with tools like web search for
literature review and mathematical software such as SageMath. Our results show
that current LLMs can succeed at the more accessible research-level questions,
but still encounter significant difficulties on more challenging problems.
Quantitatively, Grok-4 achieves the highest accuracy of 52% on final-answer
subproblems, while GPT-5 obtains the best performance for proof generation,
achieving a fully correct solution for 22% of problems. IMProofBench will
continue to evolve as a dynamic benchmark in collaboration with the
mathematical community, ensuring its relevance for evaluating the next
generation of LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了RSO框架，通过分层策略优化提升对话推荐系统的性能，将响应生成分解为宏观策略规划和微观适应


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法缺乏明确的交互策略优化，依赖统一提示导致次优结果

Method: 分层框架：规划器选择策略（推荐、解释、鼓励等），执行器在专家网络指导下生成响应，将策略学习建模为强化学习

Result: 实验显示RSO优于现有最先进基线方法

Conclusion: 分层策略优化在对话推荐系统中有效

Abstract: Conversational Recommender Systems (CRSs) provide personalized
recommendations through multi-turn interactions. With the strong reasoning
abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), applying them to CRSs has become
promising. Yet, existing methods often lack explicit optimization of
interaction strategies, relying instead on unified prompts, which can yield
suboptimal outcomes. We propose Reinforced Strategy Optimization (RSO), a
hierarchical framework that decomposes response generation into macro-level
strategy planning and micro-level adaptation within a network-of-experts. A
Planner selects strategies (e.g., recommend, explain, encourage), while an
Actor generates responses guided by auxiliary experts for preferences and
factual grounding. This disentanglement enables more tractable learning. To
address limited multi-turn data, we model strategy learning as reinforcement
learning with an LLM-based reward for exploration. Experiments show RSO
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, validating the effectiveness of
hierarchical strategy optimization.

Motivation: 为电商平台提供基于实际客户反馈的、可解释的产品评论摘要，帮助消费者快速了解产品优缺点

Method: 首先从单个评论中提取和整合方面-情感对，为每个产品选择最频繁的方面并采样代表性评论，然后构建结构化提示指导LLM生成基于真实客户反馈的摘要

Abstract: We present a scalable large language model (LLM)-based system that combines
aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) with guided summarization to generate
concise and interpretable product review summaries for the Wayfair platform.
Our approach first extracts and consolidates aspect-sentiment pairs from
individual reviews, selects the most frequent aspects for each product, and
samples representative reviews accordingly. These are used to construct
structured prompts that guide the LLM to produce summaries grounded in actual
customer feedback. We demonstrate the real-world effectiveness of our system
through a large-scale online A/B test. Furthermore, we describe our real-time
deployment strategy and release a dataset of 11.8 million anonymized customer
reviews covering 92,000 products, including extracted aspects and generated
summaries, to support future research in aspect-guided review summarization.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 通过向预训练词汇表中添加领域特定标记来解决词汇不匹配问题，提高LLM在专业领域的处理效率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当LLM处理训练领域之外的文本时，词汇不匹配会导致子词分割不理想，增加标记数量和处理延迟

Method: 设计一种算法来扩展现有分词器，保证分词效率不会降低，每个输入序列的分词数量最多与之前相同

Result: 在真实电商用例中，增强的分词器将输入序列缩短达20%，减少下游任务推理延迟，同时保持预测质量

Conclusion: 词汇适应不仅能提高处理效率，还能带来更广泛的好处，如影响前向传播速度和模型对新标记的采用率

Abstract: When using an LLM to process text outside the training domain(s), an often
overlooked factor is vocabulary mismatch, where the general-domain tokenizer
fails to capture frequent domain-specific terms, leading to higher token
fertility and thus a decrease in processing speed due to suboptimal sub-word
splits.
  We address this limitation by augmenting the pretrained vocabulary with a set
of domain-specific tokens. To this end, we design an algorithm that extends an
existing tokenizer while guaranteeing it never decreases tokenization
efficiency: every input sequence is segmented into at most the same number of
tokens as before.
  Evaluated on real-world e-Commerce use-cases, the augmented tokenizer
significantly shortens input sequences by up to 20% and reduces inference
latency on downstream tasks while preserving predictive quality. We further
analyze secondary effects, such as the impact on forward pass speed and the
rate at which the model adopts the newly introduced tokens, to illustrate the
broader benefits of vocabulary adaptation.

Motivation: 探索LLM多智能体系统中竞争如何影响行为，特别是过度竞争现象及其对协作和任务性能的负面影响。

Method: 提出HATE（饥饿游戏辩论）实验框架，在零和竞争环境中模拟多智能体辩论，测试不同LLM和任务，并研究不同法官反馈的影响。

Result: 竞争压力显著刺激了过度竞争行为，导致讨论偏离轨道并降低任务性能；客观的任务导向反馈能有效缓解过度竞争。

Conclusion: 需要理解和管理AI社区中涌现的社会动态，客观反馈是缓解过度竞争的关键，为多智能体系统的治理提供了重要见解。

Abstract: LLM-based multi-agent systems demonstrate great potential for tackling
complex problems, but how competition shapes their behavior remains
underexplored. This paper investigates the over-competition in multi-agent
debate, where agents under extreme pressure exhibit unreliable, harmful
behaviors that undermine both collaboration and task performance. To study this
phenomenon, we propose HATE, the Hunger Game Debate, a novel experimental
framework that simulates debates under a zero-sum competition arena. Our
experiments, conducted across a range of LLMs and tasks, reveal that
competitive pressure significantly stimulates over-competition behaviors and
degrades task performance, causing discussions to derail. We further explore
the impact of environmental feedback by adding variants of judges, indicating
that objective, task-focused feedback effectively mitigates the
over-competition behaviors. We also probe the post-hoc kindness of LLMs and
form a leaderboard to characterize top LLMs, providing insights for
understanding and governing the emergent social dynamics of AI community.

Abstract: With their growing capabilities, generative large language models (LLMs) are
being increasingly investigated for complex medical tasks. However, their
effectiveness in real-world clinical applications remains underexplored. To
address this, we present CliniBench, the first benchmark that enables
comparability of well-studied encoder-based classifiers and generative LLMs for
discharge diagnosis prediction from admission notes in MIMIC-IV dataset. Our
extensive study compares 12 generative LLMs and 3 encoder-based classifiers and
demonstrates that encoder-based classifiers consistently outperform generative

performing higher than the best submissions of the aforementioned shared task,
which employed closed proprietary LLMs. In addition, we find that

Motivation: 随着基于Transformer架构的大语言模型快速发展，区分人类书写文本和LLM生成文本变得日益困难，传统检测方法在越南语环境下效果不佳。

Method: 构建新的越南语AI生成数据集，基于Binoculars方法进行适配，优化全局阈值来检测越南语LLM生成文本。

Result: VietBinoculars在多个领域数据集上的准确率、F1分数和AUC均超过99%，优于原始Binoculars模型、传统检测方法及其他先进方法。

Conclusion: VietBinoculars在越南语LLM生成文本检测方面表现出色，特别是在特殊修改的提示策略下，优于包括ZeroGPT和DetectGPT在内的商业工具。

Abstract: The rapid development research of Large Language Models (LLMs) based on
transformer architectures raises key challenges, one of them being the task of
distinguishing between human-written text and LLM-generated text. As
LLM-generated textual content, becomes increasingly complex over time, and
resembles human writing, traditional detection methods are proving less
effective, especially as the number and diversity of LLMs continue to grow with
new models and versions being released at a rapid pace. This study proposes
VietBinoculars, an adaptation of the Binoculars method with optimized global
thresholds, to enhance the detection of Vietnamese LLM-generated text. We have
constructed new Vietnamese AI-generated datasets to determine the optimal
thresholds for VietBinoculars and to enable benchmarking. The results from our
experiments show results show that VietBinoculars achieves over 99\% in all two
domains of accuracy, F1-score, and AUC on multiple out-of-domain datasets. It
outperforms the original Binoculars model, traditional detection methods, and
other state-of-the-art approaches, including commercial tools such as ZeroGPT

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代物流管理系统需要高效的路径规划，OCVRP涉及为服务地理分布客户的车辆车队寻找最优配送路线，且车辆在配送后无需返回仓库。

Method: 使用Python开发了两种算法的实现：基于自然启发的元启发式算法ACO和行业标准优化工具包OR-Tools，并使用自定义数据集进行测试。

Result: ACO在路由参数方面具有灵活性，而OR-Tools运行速度更快、一致性更好且需要更少的输入。

Conclusion: 研究结果有助于为可扩展的实时物流系统选择合适的路由策略。

Abstract: In modern logistics management systems, route planning requires high
efficiency. The Open Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (OCVRP) deals with
finding optimal delivery routes for a fleet of vehicles serving geographically
distributed customers, without requiring the vehicles to return to the depot
after deliveries. The present study is comparative in nature and speaks of two
algorithms for OCVRP solution: Ant Colony Optimization (ACO), a nature-inspired
metaheuristic; and Google OR-Tools, an industry-standard toolkit for
optimization. Both implementations were developed in Python and using a custom
dataset. Performance appraisal was based on routing efficiency, computation
time, and scalability. The results show that ACO allows flexibility in routing
parameters while OR-Tools runs much faster with more consistency and requires
less input. This could help choose among routing strategies for scalable
real-time logistics systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实知识图谱中新实体频繁出现，模型需要在不重新训练的情况下泛化到这些实体。显式类型信息通常缺乏或不完整，即使可用也往往是粗粒度、稀疏且容易出错。

Method: 引入TyleR方法，利用预训练语言模型进行语义增强，为子图节点表示提供隐式类型信号，实现无需显式类型信息的类型感知链接预测。

Result: 在标准基准测试中，TyleR在类型注释稀缺和图连接稀疏的场景下优于最先进的基线方法。

Conclusion: 预训练语言模型能够有效丰富节点表示中的隐式类型信号，为缺乏显式类型信息的归纳链接预测提供有力支持。

Abstract: Inductive link prediction is emerging as a key paradigm for real-world
knowledge graphs (KGs), where new entities frequently appear and models must
generalize to them without retraining. Predicting links in a KG faces the
challenge of guessing previously unseen entities by leveraging generalizable
node features such as subgraph structure, type annotations, and ontological
constraints. However, explicit type information is often lacking or incomplete.
Even when available, type information in most KGs is often coarse-grained,
sparse, and prone to errors due to human annotation. In this work, we explore
the potential of pre-trained language models (PLMs) to enrich node
representations with implicit type signals. We introduce TyleR, a Type-less yet
type-awaRe approach for subgraph-based inductive link prediction that leverages
PLMs for semantic enrichment. Experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate
that TyleR outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in scenarios with scarce type
annotations and sparse graph connectivity. To ensure reproducibility, we share
our code at https://github.com/sisinflab/tyler .

Motivation: 传统微调方法需要复杂的数据混合和重复实验以获得最佳泛化性能，为了解决这些挑战并简化训练过程。

Method: 使用零学习率训练在通用数据上获取全局梯度，在领域训练中进行梯度增强和动态训练步长校正，结合退火学习建立微调流程。

Result: 在多个任务和基础模型上，DBA相比传统微调在联合性能上平均提升5.8%，GPU时间减少91.0%。

Conclusion: DBA提供了一种高效通用的解决方案，仅依赖领域数据且无需重复实验，显著提升性能并大幅降低计算成本。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) fine-tuning shows excellent implications.
However, vanilla fine-tuning methods often require intricate data mixture and
repeated experiments for optimal generalization. To address these challenges
and streamline the training process, we propose an efficient and universal
solution, Dynamic Boosted Annealing (DBA). We obtain a global gradient through
zero-learning-rate training on general data, which is subsequently employed for
gradient boosting and dynamic training step correction during domain training.
In conjunction with annealing learning, we end up establishing a fine-tuning
pipeline that relies solely on domain data without collapse. By evaluating both
general and domain-specific performance across multiple tasks on several
popular base models, DBA achieves an average improvement of 5.8% in joint
performance over vanilla fine-tuning. Furthermore, since general data is no
longer involved in annealing, repeated experiments led by data mixture are also
eliminated. According to our tests, the DBA method can reduce GPU hours by
91.0% compared to the vanilla method.

Motivation: 研究如何通过语言模型侧的设计和训练组合来控制声学稳定性和语义基础之间的平衡，而不需要改变分词器或运行时架构。

Method: 使用自监督特征初始化语音标记，应用轻量对齐损失，并采用稀疏化和辅助目标训练，针对鲁棒性和内容规划。训练了三个模型：0.7B纯语音模型、1.0B纯语音模型和1.0B文本语音交错模型。

Result: 纯语音模型在说话人、性别、情感、房间和背景因素方面实现了最高的一致性，超越了更大的系统。交错模型改善了词汇和句法探测以及语义-声学对齐，但降低了一致性。线性探测显示初始化使模型偏向内容结构，同时牺牲韵律细节。

Conclusion: 语言模型侧的设计和训练组合能够控制声学稳定性和语义基础之间的平衡，无需改变分词器或运行时架构。

Abstract: We study speech language models that incorporate semantic initialization and
planning losses to achieve robust and consistent generation. Our approach
initializes speech tokens with self-supervised features, applies a light
alignment loss, and trains with thinning and auxiliary objectives that target
robustness and content planning. We train three models: a 0.7B speech-only
model, a 1.0B speech-only model, and a 1.0B interleaved model with both text
and speech. Acoustic studies show that the speech-only models achieve the
highest consistency across speaker, gender, sentiment, room, and background
factors, surpassing larger systems. Interleaving improves lexical and syntactic
probes and semantic--acoustic alignment but reduces consistency. Linear probes
show that our initialization biases the model toward content structure while
trading off prosody detail. These results show that LM-side design and training
mix control the balance between acoustic stability and semantic grounding
without changes to the tokenizer or runtime architecture. A demo and model
weights are available for exploration.

Abstract: Dialogue summarization aims to distill the core meaning of a conversation
into a concise text. This is crucial for reducing the complexity and noise
inherent in dialogue-heavy applications. While recent approaches typically
train language models to mimic human-written summaries, such supervision is
costly and often results in outputs that lack task-specific focus limiting
their effectiveness in downstream applications, such as medical tasks. In this
paper, we propose \app, a framework for task-oriented utility-based dialogue
summarization. \app starts by generating multiple summaries and task-oriented
question-answer pairs from a dialogue in a zero-shot manner using a pool of
large language models (LLMs). The quality of the generated summaries is
evaluated by having LLMs answer task-related questions before \textit{(i)}
selecting the best candidate answers and \textit{(ii)} identifying the most
informative summary based on these answers. Finally, we fine-tune the best LLM
on the selected summaries. When validated on multiple datasets, \app
demonstrates its effectiveness by achieving competitive results in various
zero-shot settings, rivaling fully-supervised State-of-the-Art (SotA) methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI模型评估方法难以衡量人格等主观特质，基于人类反馈的排名方法存在不透明性，且模型可能过度拟合这些反馈。缺乏公开工具来显式评估模型人格。

Method: 开发开源工具包Feedback Forensics，利用AI标注器通过Python API和浏览器应用调查人格特征，分析流行人类反馈数据集和模型的人格特质。

Result: 分析了Chatbot Arena、MultiPref和PRISM等数据集鼓励的人格特质，并评估了流行模型在这些特质上的表现。发布了工具包、web应用和标注数据。

Conclusion: Feedback Forensics填补了AI人格评估工具的空缺，有助于追踪模型人格变化，防止过度拟合和不良人格特质的传播。

Abstract: Some traits making a "good" AI model are hard to describe upfront. For
example, should responses be more polite or more casual? Such traits are
sometimes summarized as model character or personality. Without a clear
objective, conventional benchmarks based on automatic validation struggle to
measure such traits. Evaluation methods using human feedback such as Chatbot
Arena have emerged as a popular alternative. These methods infer "better"
personality and other desirable traits implicitly by ranking multiple model
responses relative to each other. Recent issues with model releases highlight
limitations of these existing opaque evaluation approaches: a major model was
rolled back over sycophantic personality issues, models were observed
overfitting to such feedback-based leaderboards. Despite these known issues,
limited public tooling exists to explicitly evaluate model personality. We
introduce Feedback Forensics: an open-source toolkit to track AI personality
changes, both those encouraged by human (or AI) feedback, and those exhibited
across AI models trained and evaluated on such feedback. Leveraging AI
annotators, our toolkit enables investigating personality via Python API and
browser app. We demonstrate the toolkit's usefulness in two steps: (A) first we
analyse the personality traits encouraged in popular human feedback datasets
including Chatbot Arena, MultiPref and PRISM; and (B) then use our toolkit to
analyse how much popular models exhibit such traits. We release (1) our
Feedback Forensics toolkit alongside (2) a web app tracking AI personality in
popular models and feedback datasets as well as (3) the underlying annotation
data at https://github.com/rdnfn/feedback-forensics.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: OTR是一种新颖的微调算法，通过将自回归学习过程重新定义为单步强化学习轨迹，利用策略梯度方法指导监督微调，从而提升语言模型的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 监督微调(SFT)在泛化能力上往往不如强化学习(RL)，作者认为这种性能差异不仅源于损失函数，更根本的原因在于数据性质：SFT使用固定的预收集数据集，而RL使用从当前策略采样的在线数据。

Method: 提出单步展开(OTR)算法，将每个token生成视为单步强化学习轨迹。在每个步骤中，从当前策略分布中采样多个候选token，使用监督数据中的真实token为这些样本提供奖励信号，通过策略梯度将静态离线数据转化为动态在线信号。

Result: 在数学推理、代码生成和通用领域推理等多个具有挑战性的基准测试中，OTR始终优于标准SFT，证明了其有效性。

Conclusion: OTR为微调大语言模型提供了一个强大实用的替代方案，证明了数据的在线性质是泛化能力的关键驱动因素，为LLM微调提供了新的研究方向。

Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is the predominant method for adapting large
language models (LLMs), yet it often struggles with generalization compared to
reinforcement learning (RL). In this work, we posit that this performance
disparity stems not just from the loss function, but from a more fundamental
difference: SFT learns from a fixed, pre-collected dataset, whereas RL utilizes
on-policy data sampled from the current policy. Building on this hypothesis, we
introduce one-token rollout (OTR), a novel fine-tuning algorithm that guides
SFT with the policy gradient method. OTR reframes the autoregressive learning
process by treating each token generation as a single-step reinforcement
learning trajectory. At each step, it performs a Monte Carlo ``rollout'' by
sampling multiple candidate tokens from the current policy's distribution. The
ground-truth token from the supervised data is then used to provide a reward
signal to these samples. Guided by policy gradient, our algorithm repurposes
static, off-policy supervised data into a dynamic, on-policy signal at the
token level, capturing the generalization benefits of on-policy learning while
bypassing the costly overhead of full sentence generation. Through extensive
experiments on a diverse suite of challenging benchmarks spanning mathematical
reasoning, code generation, and general domain reasoning, we demonstrate that
OTR consistently outperforms standard SFT. Our findings establish OTR as a
powerful and practical alternative for fine-tuning LLMs and provide compelling
evidence that the on-policy nature of data is a critical driver of
generalization, offering a promising new direction for fine-tuning LLMs.

TL;DR: 本文系统研究了Huggin-3.5B在潜在空间中的思考过程，提出了潜在思考优化(LTO)方法，使用潜在奖励模型(LRM)来优化LLM的潜在思考过程，显著提高了推理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LLM的言语思考计算成本高且容易过度思考，而潜在思考架构缺乏可解释性和监督，引发对其正确性和可靠性的担忧。

Method: 提出潜在思考优化(LTO)算法，使用潜在分类器作为潜在奖励模型(LRM)来检测和优化错误的潜在思考模式。

Result: 实验表明LRM能有效检测错误的潜在思考模式，LTO能显著改进潜在思考过程，且该方法可泛化到不同领域和一般LLM。

Conclusion: 在潜在空间中进行奖励建模和扩展测试时思考具有监督是可行的，这为提高LLM思考过程提供了一种通用、高效且领域无关的方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at problem solving by generating chain of
thoughts in natural language, but such verbal thinking is computationally
costly and prone to overthinking. Recent work instead proposes a latent
thinking architecture Huggin-3.5B, which represents intermediate reasoning
steps as sequence of latent representations. However, latent thoughts lack
interpretability and are difficult to supervise, raising concerns about the
correctness and reliability of its latent thinking processes. In this paper, we
provide a systematic study of how Huggin-3.5B thinks in the latent space and
how external supervision signals can improve its latent thinking processes. We
show that latent thoughts leading to correct versus incorrect answers exhibit
highly distinguishable patterns, and that a latent classifier can reliably
predict answer correctness directly from latent thoughts. Leveraging these
insights, we propose Latent Thinking Optimization (LTO), a probabilistic
algorithm that employs the latent classifier as a Latent Reward Model (LRM) to
optimize the latent thinking processes. Extensive experiments across diverse
reasoning tasks demonstrate that LRM is highly effective in detecting incorrect
latent thinking patterns, and LTO can significantly improve the latent thinking
processes. Furthermore, we show that LRM can generalize across diverse domains,
and LTO can be seamlessly applied to general LLMs to improve their thinking
processes. In contrast to verbal thinking, our method demonstrates that reward
modeling and scaling test-time thinking with supervision can be performed
directly in the latent space, highlighting its potential as a general,
efficient, and domain-agnostic approach to improving the thinking processes of
LLMs.

TL;DR: Fast-dLLM v2通过块扩散机制将预训练的自回归LLM转换为并行文本生成的扩散语言模型，仅需1B tokens微调，实现500倍训练数据减少，同时保持模型性能，解码速度提升2.5倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归LLM的顺序解码限制了推理效率，需要开发能够并行生成文本的高效模型。

Method: 结合块扩散机制和互补注意力掩码的训练方法，引入分层缓存机制（块级缓存和子块缓存），配合并行解码流水线。

Result: 在多样化基准测试中，Fast-dLLM v2在准确度上匹配或超越自回归基线，同时在dLLM中实现最先进的效率，解码速度提升2.5倍。

Conclusion: Fast-dLLM v2标志着向快速准确LLM实际部署迈出的重要一步，在保持生成质量的同时显著提升效率。

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable
performance across a wide range of natural language tasks, yet their inherent
sequential decoding limits inference efficiency. In this work, we propose
Fast-dLLM v2, a carefully designed block diffusion language model (dLLM) that
efficiently adapts pretrained AR models into dLLMs for parallel text
generation, requiring only approximately 1B tokens of fine-tuning. This
represents a 500x reduction in training data compared to full-attention
diffusion LLMs such as Dream (580B tokens), while preserving the original
model's performance. Our approach introduces a novel training recipe that
combines a block diffusion mechanism with a complementary attention mask,
enabling blockwise bidirectional context modeling without sacrificing AR
training objectives. To further accelerate decoding, we design a hierarchical
caching mechanism: a block-level cache that stores historical context
representations across blocks, and a sub-block cache that enables efficient
parallel generation within partially decoded blocks. Coupled with our parallel
decoding pipeline, Fast-dLLM v2 achieves up to 2.5x speedup over standard AR
decoding without compromising generation quality. Extensive experiments across
diverse benchmarks demonstrate that Fast-dLLM v2 matches or surpasses AR
baselines in accuracy, while delivering state-of-the-art efficiency among dLLMs
- marking a significant step toward the practical deployment of fast and
accurate LLMs. Code and model will be publicly released.

TL;DR: KG-R1是一个通过强化学习实现的单智能体知识图谱检索增强生成框架，相比多模块KG-RAG系统更高效且具有可迁移性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统KG-RAG系统使用多个LLM模块导致推理成本高且绑定特定知识图谱，需要更高效和可迁移的解决方案。

Method: 使用单个智能体与知识图谱环境交互，通过端到端强化学习优化检索、推理和生成过程。

Result: 在KGQA基准测试中，使用Qwen-2.5-3B模型，KG-R1以更少的生成token实现了更高的答案准确性，且在新知识图谱上无需修改也能保持强准确性。

Conclusion: KG-R1是一个有前景的KG-RAG框架，具有高效性和可迁移性，适合实际部署。

Abstract: Knowledge-graph retrieval-augmented generation (KG-RAG) couples large
language models (LLMs) with structured, verifiable knowledge graphs (KGs) to
reduce hallucinations and expose reasoning traces. However, many KG-RAG systems
compose multiple LLM modules (e.g planning, reasoning, and responding),
inflating inference cost and binding behavior to a specific target KG. To
address this, we introduce KG-R1, an agentic KG retrieval-augmented generation
(KG-RAG) framework through reinforcement learning (RL). KG-R1 utilizes a single
agent that interacts with KGs as its environment, learning to retrieve at each
step and incorporating the retrieved information into its reasoning and
generation. The process is optimized through end-to-end RL. In controlled
experiments across Knowledge-Graph Question Answering (KGQA) benchmarks, our
method demonstrates both efficiency and transferability: Using Qwen-2.5-3B,
KG-R1 improves answer accuracy with fewer generation tokens than prior
multi-module workflow methods that use larger foundation or fine-tuned models.
Furthermore, KG-R1 enables plug and play: after training, it maintains strong
accuracy on new KGs without modification. These properties make KG-R1 a
promising KG-RAG framework for real-world deployment. Our code is publicly
available at https://github.com/Jinyeop3110/KG-R1.

Abstract: Factuality assesses the extent to which a language utterance relates to
real-world information; it determines whether utterances correspond to facts,
possibilities, or imaginary situations, and as such, it is instrumental for
fact checking. Factuality is a complex notion that relies on multiple
linguistic signals, and has been studied in various disciplines.
  We present a complex, multi-faceted annotation scheme of factuality that
combines concepts from a variety of previous works. We developed the scheme for
Hebrew, but we trust that it can be adapted to other languages. We also present
a set of almost 5,000 sentences in the domain of parliamentary discourse that
we manually annotated according to this scheme. We report on inter-annotator
agreement, and experiment with various approaches to automatically predict
(some features of) the scheme, in order to extend the annotation to a large
corpus.

Conclusion: 微调的小型语言模型在自动项目对齐方面表现出色，特别是在细粒度技能对齐任务中，为测试开发提供了有效的自动化工具。

Abstract: Aligning test items to content standards is a critical step in test
development to collect validity evidence based on content. Item alignment has
typically been conducted by human experts. This judgmental process can be
subjective and time-consuming. This study investigated the performance of
fine-tuned small language models (SLMs) for automated item alignment using data
from a large-scale standardized reading and writing test for college
admissions. Different SLMs were trained for alignment at both domain and skill
levels respectively with 10 skills mapped to 4 content domains. The model
performance was evaluated in multiple criteria on two testing datasets. The
impact of types and sizes of the input data for training was investigated.
Results showed that including more item text data led to substantially better
model performance, surpassing the improvements induced by sample size increase
alone. For comparison, supervised machine learning models were trained using
the embeddings from the multilingual-E5-large-instruct model. The study results
showed that fine-tuned SLMs consistently outperformed the embedding-based
supervised machine learning models, particularly for the more fine-grained
skill alignment. To better understand model misclassifications, multiple
semantic similarity analysis including pairwise cosine similarity,
Kullback-Leibler divergence of embedding distributions, and two-dimension
projections of item embeddings were conducted. These analyses consistently
showed that certain skills in SAT and PSAT were semantically too close,
providing evidence for the observed misclassification.

Motivation: 传统可控摘要方法面临属性相互依赖的挑战，且需要针对每个属性进行微调，限制了灵活性

Method: 使用定制化蒙特卡洛树搜索(MCTS)将任务重构为顺序属性控制的规划问题，节点表示摘要，动作对应单属性调整

Result: 在多个领域和模型上的实验表明，PACO实现了强大的多属性可控性，超越了基于LLM的自规划模型和微调基线

Conclusion: PACO框架能够自适应发现最优控制顺序，有效满足所有约束条件，在更大模型上表现更优

Abstract: Controllable summarization moves beyond generic outputs toward human-aligned
summaries guided by specified attributes. In practice, the interdependence
among attributes makes it challenging for language models to satisfy correlated
constraints consistently. Moreover, previous approaches often require
per-attribute fine-tuning, limiting flexibility across diverse summary
attributes. In this paper, we propose adaptive planning for multi-attribute
controllable summarization (PACO), a training-free framework that reframes the
task as planning the order of sequential attribute control with a customized
Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). In PACO, nodes represent summaries, and actions
correspond to single-attribute adjustments, enabling progressive refinement of
only the attributes requiring further control. This strategy adaptively
discovers optimal control orders, ultimately producing summaries that
effectively meet all constraints. Extensive experiments across diverse domains
and models demonstrate that PACO achieves robust multi-attribute
controllability, surpassing both LLM-based self-planning models and fine-tuned
baselines. Remarkably, PACO with Llama-3.2-1B rivals the controllability of the
much larger Llama-3.3-70B baselines. With larger models, PACO achieves superior
control performance, outperforming all competitors.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当代大语言模型在创意写作中的关键限制：类型多样性受限、输出长度不足、叙事连贯性弱、无法实现复杂结构构造。

Method: 采用故事原型（知识图谱叙事表示）和三阶段智能体工作流：初始化阶段构建叙事骨架，生成阶段通过多智能体对话实例化故事原型，写作阶段生成多类型文本。

Result: 在广泛实验中，CreAgentive以低成本（每100章不到1美元）生成数千章稳定质量的文本，在10个叙事指标上持续优于强基线，接近人类创作小说的质量。

Conclusion: CreAgentive通过解耦故事逻辑与风格实现，有效克服长文本生成的瓶颈，在多样类型中实现稳健性能。

Abstract: We present CreAgentive, an agent workflow driven multi-category creative
generation engine that addresses four key limitations of contemporary large
language models in writing stories, drama and other categories of creatives:
restricted genre diversity, insufficient output length, weak narrative
coherence, and inability to enforce complex structural constructs. At its core,
CreAgentive employs a Story Prototype, which is a genre-agnostic, knowledge
graph-based narrative representation that decouples story logic from stylistic
realization by encoding characters, events, and environments as semantic
triples. CreAgentive engages a three-stage agent workflow that comprises: an
Initialization Stage that constructs a user-specified narrative skeleton; a
Generation Stage in which long- and short-term objectives guide multi-agent
dialogues to instantiate the Story Prototype; a Writing Stage that leverages
this prototype to produce multi-genre text with advanced structures such as
retrospection and foreshadowing. This architecture reduces storage redundancy
and overcomes the typical bottlenecks of long-form generation. In extensive
experiments, CreAgentive generates thousands of chapters with stable quality
and low cost (less than $1 per 100 chapters) using a general-purpose backbone
model. To evaluate performance, we define a two-dimensional framework with 10
narrative indicators measuring both quality and length. Results show that
CreAgentive consistently outperforms strong baselines and achieves robust
performance across diverse genres, approaching the quality of human-authored
novels.

TL;DR: dParallel是一种简单有效的方法，通过确定性强制蒸馏训练策略，解锁扩散大语言模型的并行解码潜力，显著减少解码步骤同时保持性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散大语言模型作为自回归生成的有前景替代方案，具有并行令牌预测和更低推理延迟的优势，但其并行解码潜力尚未充分探索，现有开源模型仍需接近令牌长度的解码步骤来保证性能。

Method: 提出dParallel方法，核心是确定性强制蒸馏训练策略，通过蒸馏模型遵循原始采样轨迹，同时强制模型以更快速和并行的方式在掩码令牌上达到高确定性。

Result: 在LLaDA-8B-Instruct模型上，GSM8K的解码步骤从256减少到30，实现8.5倍加速且无性能下降；在MBPP基准测试中，解码步骤从256减少到24，实现10.5倍加速同时保持准确性。

Conclusion: dParallel方法能够显著减少扩散大语言模型的解码步骤，大幅提升推理速度，同时保持模型性能，为并行解码提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) have recently drawn considerable
attention within the research community as a promising alternative to
autoregressive generation, offering parallel token prediction and lower
inference latency. Yet, their parallel decoding potential remains largely
underexplored, as existing open-source models still require nearly token-length
decoding steps to ensure performance. To address this, we introduce dParallel,
a simple and effective method that unlocks the inherent parallelism of dLLMs
for fast sampling. We identify that the key bottleneck to parallel decoding
arises from the sequential certainty convergence for masked tokens. Building on
this insight, we introduce the core of our approach: certainty-forcing
distillation, a novel training strategy that distills the model to follow its
original sampling trajectories while enforcing it to achieve high certainty on
masked tokens more rapidly and in parallel. Extensive experiments across
various benchmarks demonstrate that our method can dramatically reduce the
number of decoding steps while maintaining performance. When applied to the
LLaDA-8B-Instruct model, dParallel reduces decoding steps from 256 to 30 on
GSM8K, achieving an 8.5x speedup without performance degradation. On the MBPP
benchmark, it cuts decoding steps from 256 to 24, resulting in a 10.5x speedup
while maintaining accuracy. Our code is available at

Abstract: As LLM-based agents are increasingly deployed in real-life scenarios,
existing benchmarks fail to capture their inherent complexity of handling
extensive information, leveraging diverse resources, and managing dynamic user
interactions. To address this gap, we introduce VitaBench, a challenging
benchmark that evaluates agents on versatile interactive tasks grounded in
real-world settings. Drawing from daily applications in food delivery, in-store
consumption, and online travel services, VitaBench presents agents with the
most complex life-serving simulation environment to date, comprising 66 tools.
Through a framework that eliminates domain-specific policies, we enable
flexible composition of these scenarios and tools, yielding 100 cross-scenario
tasks (main results) and 300 single-scenario tasks. Each task is derived from
multiple real user requests and requires agents to reason across temporal and
spatial dimensions, utilize complex tool sets, proactively clarify ambiguous
instructions, and track shifting user intent throughout multi-turn
conversations. Moreover, we propose a rubric-based sliding window evaluator,
enabling robust assessment of diverse solution pathways in complex environments
and stochastic interactions. Our comprehensive evaluation reveals that even the
most advanced models achieve only 30% success rate on cross-scenario tasks, and
less than 50% success rate on others. Overall, we believe VitaBench will serve
as a valuable resource for advancing the development of AI agents in practical
real-world applications. The code, dataset, and leaderboard are available at

Conclusion: 将语音对象化为文本声音特征能更有效地解锁LLMs的语言智能，为可控语音合成提供了新范式。

Abstract: The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) is reshaping multimodel models, with
speech synthesis being a prominent application. However, existing approaches
often underutilize the linguistic intelligence of these models, typically
failing to leverage their powerful instruction-following capabilities. This
limitation hinders the model's ability to follow text instructions for
controllable Text-to-Speech~(TTS). To address this, we propose a new paradigm
inspired by ``operationalism'' that decouples instruction understanding from
speech generation. We introduce BatonVoice, a framework where an LLM acts as a
``conductor'', understanding user instructions and generating a textual
``plan'' -- explicit vocal features (e.g., pitch, energy). A separate TTS
model, the ``orchestra'', then generates the speech from these features. To
realize this component, we develop BatonTTS, a TTS model trained specifically
for this task. Our experiments demonstrate that BatonVoice achieves strong
performance in controllable and emotional speech synthesis, outperforming
strong open- and closed-source baselines. Notably, our approach enables
remarkable zero-shot cross-lingual generalization, accurately applying feature
control abilities to languages unseen during post-training. This demonstrates
that objectifying speech into textual vocal features can more effectively
unlock the linguistic intelligence of LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准MoE模型的Top-K路由策略在推理时改变激活专家数量会导致性能急剧下降，限制了MoE模型的弹性推理潜力。

Method: 在训练过程中系统性地改变激活专家数量，强制模型学习从粗到细的结构：排名靠前的专家提供基本能力，后续专家添加更精细的细节。采用分层随机化策略。

Result: 单个M-MoE模型在多种专家数量下都能保持优异性能，接近专门训练的多模型集合，但训练成本大幅降低。

Conclusion: M-MoE为大规模MoE模型的实用和适应性部署开辟了新途径，实现了弹性推理和按层分配计算预算的优化。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has emerged as a promising paradigm for efficiently
scaling large language models without a proportional increase in computational
cost. However, the standard training strategy of Top-K router prevents MoE
models from realizing their full potential for elastic inference. When the
number of activated experts is altered at inference time, these models exhibit
precipitous performance degradation. In this work, we introduce Matryoshka MoE
(M-MoE), a training framework that instills a coarse-to-fine structure directly
into the expert ensemble. By systematically varying the number of activated
experts during training, M-MoE compels the model to learn a meaningful ranking:
top-ranked experts collaborate to provide essential, coarse-grained
capabilities, while subsequent experts add progressively finer-grained detail.
We explore this principle at multiple granularities, identifying a layer-wise
randomization strategy as the most effective. Our experiments demonstrate that
a single M-MoE model achieves remarkable elasticity, with its performance at
various expert counts closely matching that of an entire suite of specialist
models, but at only a fraction of the total training cost. This flexibility not
only unlocks elastic inference but also enables optimizing performance by
allocating different computational budgets to different model layers. Our work
paves the way for more practical and adaptable deployments of large-scale MoE
models.

integrates perception, memory, and sequential decision-making. Agents are
required to comprehend optical and sonar data, autonomously explore complex
environments, and accomplish long-horizon objectives under these harsh
conditions. Extensive experiments reveal substantial gaps between
state-of-the-art MLLM-driven agents and human experts, highlighting the
persistent difficulty of perception, planning, and adaptability in ocean
underwater environments. By providing a high-fidelity, rigorously designed
platform, OceanGym establishes a testbed for developing robust embodied AI and
transferring these capabilities to real-world autonomous ocean underwater
vehicles, marking a decisive step toward intelligent agents capable of
operating in one of Earth's last unexplored frontiers. The code and data are

TL;DR: 提出了首个用于语音转文本生成模型的对比解释方法，通过分析输入频谱图各部分如何影响替代输出选择，扩展了对比解释在语音转文本领域的应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对比解释能比标准解释提供更多信息和可解释性，但目前在语音转文本生成模型中获取此类解释仍是一个开放挑战。

Method: 基于特征归因技术，通过分析输入频谱图各部分如何影响目标输出与替代输出之间的选择，来生成对比解释。

Result: 在语音翻译中的性别分配案例研究中，该方法能准确识别驱动选择某一性别而非另一性别的音频特征。

Conclusion: 通过将对比解释范围扩展到语音转文本领域，为更好地理解语音转文本模型奠定了基础。

Abstract: Contrastive explanations, which indicate why an AI system produced one output
(the target) instead of another (the foil), are widely regarded in explainable
AI as more informative and interpretable than standard explanations. However,
obtaining such explanations for speech-to-text (S2T) generative models remains
an open challenge. Drawing from feature attribution techniques, we propose the
first method to obtain contrastive explanations in S2T by analyzing how parts
of the input spectrogram influence the choice between alternative outputs.
Through a case study on gender assignment in speech translation, we show that
our method accurately identifies the audio features that drive the selection of
one gender over another. By extending the scope of contrastive explanations to
S2T, our work provides a foundation for better understanding S2T models.

TL;DR: FuncBenchGen是一个用于评估工具增强语言模型的统一框架，通过生成合成多步骤工具使用任务来避免数据污染，并允许精确控制任务难度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工具增强语言模型基准在函数数量、任务复杂度和输入规模控制方面不足，且容易受到数据污染的影响。

Method: 将工具使用建模为在隐藏函数依赖DAG上的遍历，节点是函数调用，边表示函数间的输出依赖关系。模型需要组合正确的调用序列来计算目标变量。

Result: 推理优化模型表现优于通用模型，GPT-5显著领先。性能随依赖深度增加而急剧下降，连接的不相关函数特别难以处理。模型常做出语法正确但参数值错误的调用。

Conclusion: 引入简单的缓解策略，在每一步明确重述先前变量值，可显著提升模型性能，如GPT-5的成功率从62.5%提升到81.3%。

Abstract: As language models gain access to external tools via structured function
calls, they become increasingly more capable of solving complex, multi-step
tasks. However, existing benchmarks for tool-augmented language models (TaLMs)
provide insufficient control over factors such as the number of functions
accessible, task complexity, and input size, and remain vulnerable to data
contamination. We present FuncBenchGen, a unified, contamination-free framework
that evaluates TaLMs by generating synthetic multi-step tool-use tasks. The key
idea is to cast tool use as traversal over a hidden function-dependency DAG
where nodes are function calls and an edge between nodes represents one
function consuming the output of another. Given a set of external function
schemas, initial variable values, and a target variable, models must compose
the correct call sequence to compute the target variable. FuncBenchGen allows
users to precisely control task difficulty (e.g., graph size, dependency depth,
and distractor functions) while avoiding data leakage. We apply our
FuncBenchGen framework to evaluate seven LLMs on tool use tasks of varying
difficulty. Reasoning-optimized models consistently outperform general-purpose
models with GPT-5 significantly outperforming other models. Performance
declines sharply as dependency depth increases. Furthermore, connected
irrelevant functions prove especially difficult to handle. We find that strong
models often make syntactically valid function calls but propagate incorrect or
stale argument values across steps, revealing brittle state tracking by LLMs in
multi-turn tool use. Motivated by this observation, we introduce a simple
mitigation strategy that explicitly restates prior variable values to the agent
at each step. Surprisingly, this lightweight change yields substantial gains
across models. e.g., yielding a success rate improvement from 62.5% to 81.3%
for GPT-5.

TL;DR: MT-breaker是一种使用大语言模型迭代优化源文本来提高翻译难度的方法，通过查询目标机器翻译模型来生成更具挑战性但保持自然性的测试用例。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的机器翻译基准测试很快过时，因为大多数例子对最先进的翻译模型来说太容易，无法有效区分模型优劣或揭示模型弱点。

Method: 让大语言模型迭代优化源文本，通过查询目标机器翻译模型来指导生成困难示例，保持文本的自然性和多样性。

Result: 该方法生成的示例对目标MT模型更具挑战性，同时难度也能迁移到其他模型和语言。

Conclusion: MT-breaker提供了一种有效生成困难翻译测试用例的方法，能够更好地评估和揭示机器翻译模型的局限性。

Abstract: Machine translation benchmarks sourced from the real world are quickly
obsoleted, due to most examples being easy for state-of-the-art translation
models. This limits the benchmark's ability to distinguish which model is
better or to reveal models' weaknesses. Current methods for creating difficult
test cases, such as subsampling or from-scratch synthesis, either fall short of
identifying difficult examples or suffer from a lack of diversity and
naturalness. Inspired by the iterative process of human experts probing for
model failures, we propose MT-breaker, a method where a large language model
iteratively refines a source text to increase its translation difficulty. The
LLM iteratively queries a target machine translation model to guide its
generation of difficult examples. Our approach generates examples that are more
challenging for the target MT model while preserving the diversity of natural
texts. While the examples are tailored to a particular machine translation
model during the generation, the difficulty also transfers to other models and
languages.

TL;DR: LLM生成的基准测试存在自我偏见，会系统性偏向生成该基准的模型本身，特别是在低资源语言的翻译任务中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型开始饱和现有基准测试，使用LLM自动创建基准测试成为可扩展的替代方案，但需要验证其可靠性。

Method: 通过分析LLM作为测试集和评估者两种角色，研究自我偏见的来源和影响因素，包括模型生成能力和源文本多样性。

Result: 发现自我偏见来自测试数据生成和评估方法两方面，且组合效应会放大偏见；偏见程度受模型在源语言生成能力影响；源文本多样性低是偏见原因之一。

Conclusion: 提高生成源文本的多样性可以缓解部分自我偏见，为LLM基准测试的可靠性提供改进方向。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) begin to saturate existing benchmarks,
automated benchmark creation using LLMs (LLM as a benchmark) has emerged as a
scalable alternative to slow and costly human curation. While these generated
test sets have to potential to cheaply rank models, we demonstrate a critical
flaw. LLM generated benchmarks systematically favor the model that created the
benchmark, they exhibit self bias on low resource languages to English
translation tasks. We show three key findings on automatic benchmarking of LLMs
for translation: First, this bias originates from two sources: the generated
test data (LLM as a testset) and the evaluation method (LLM as an evaluator),
with their combination amplifying the effect. Second, self bias in LLM as a
benchmark is heavily influenced by the model's generation capabilities in the
source language. For instance, we observe more pronounced bias in into English
translation, where the model's generation system is developed, than in out of
English translation tasks. Third, we observe that low diversity in source text
is one attribution to self bias. Our results suggest that improving the
diversity of these generated source texts can mitigate some of the observed
self bias.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 确保LLM在多语言环境下的母语级别响应质量具有挑战性，需要系统化的评估框架来提升多语言能力。

Method: 引入MENLO框架，基于受众设计机制创建人工标注数据集，采用成对评估、结构化标注标准，以及强化学习、奖励塑造和多任务学习等方法优化LLM评估器。

Result: 零样本LLM评估器在成对评估中表现显著提升，但依然落后于人类标注者；通过微调可大幅改进评估器性能，RL训练的评估器可作为生成奖励模型提升LLM多语言能力。

Conclusion: 研究为可扩展的多语言评估和偏好对齐提供了有前景的方向，数据集和框架的发布将支持多语言LLM评估的进一步研究。

Abstract: Ensuring native-like quality of large language model (LLM) responses across
many languages is challenging. To address this, we introduce MENLO, a framework
that operationalizes the evaluation of native-like response quality based on
audience design-inspired mechanisms. Using MENLO, we create a dataset of 6,423
human-annotated prompt-response preference pairs covering four quality
dimensions with high inter-annotator agreement in 47 language varieties. Our
evaluation reveals that zero-shot LLM judges benefit significantly from
pairwise evaluation and our structured annotation rubrics, yet they still
underperform human annotators on our dataset. We demonstrate substantial
improvements through fine-tuning with reinforcement learning, reward shaping,
and multi-task learning approaches. Additionally, we show that RL-trained
judges can serve as generative reward models to enhance LLMs' multilingual
proficiency, though discrepancies with human judgment remain. Our findings
suggest promising directions for scalable multilingual evaluation and
preference alignment. We release our dataset and evaluation framework to
support further research in multilingual LLM evaluation.

Result: 消耗超过20,000 GPU小时，生成约5,000个独特科学想法，实验验证约1,100个，在三个前沿AI任务上分别超越人类SOTA方法183.7%、1.9%和7.9%。

Conclusion: 这是首个大规模证据表明AI能够在科学任务上实现超越人类最先进水平的发现，真正推动科学发现的前沿。

Abstract: While previous AI Scientist systems can generate novel findings, they often
lack the focus to produce scientifically valuable contributions that address
pressing human-defined challenges. We introduce DeepScientist, a system
designed to overcome this by conducting goal-oriented, fully autonomous
scientific discovery over month-long timelines. It formalizes discovery as a
Bayesian Optimization problem, operationalized through a hierarchical
evaluation process consisting of "hypothesize, verify, and analyze". Leveraging
a cumulative Findings Memory, this loop intelligently balances the exploration
of novel hypotheses with exploitation, selectively promoting the most promising
findings to higher-fidelity levels of validation. Consuming over 20,000 GPU
hours, the system generated about 5,000 unique scientific ideas and
experimentally validated approximately 1100 of them, ultimately surpassing
human-designed state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on three frontier AI tasks by
183.7\%, 1.9\%, and 7.9\%. This work provides the first large-scale evidence of
an AI achieving discoveries that progressively surpass human SOTA on scientific
tasks, producing valuable findings that genuinely push the frontier of
scientific discovery. To facilitate further research into this process, we will
open-source all experimental logs and system code at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NLP模型需要具有足够挑战性的测试数据，但直接从互联网上数万个潜在主题中寻找最困难的主题在计算上是不可行的

Method: 将每个主题视为老虎机的一个臂，通过拉动臂（采样示例）来评估难度，使用多臂老虎机策略在固定计算预算内高效识别最困难主题

Result: 在机器翻译任务中，各种老虎机策略显著优于暴力搜索等基线方法

Conclusion: 多臂老虎机框架能够高效地在大量潜在主题中识别最具挑战性的测试数据，为NLP模型评估提供了计算可行的方法

Abstract: NLP models require test data that are sufficiently challenging. The
difficulty of an example is linked to the topic it originates from (''seed
topic''). The relationship between the topic and the difficulty of its
instances is stochastic in nature: an example about a difficult topic can
happen to be easy, and vice versa. At the scale of the Internet, there are tens
of thousands of potential topics, and finding the most difficult one by drawing
and evaluating a large number of examples across all topics is computationally
infeasible. We formalize this task and treat it as a multi-armed bandit
problem. In this framework, each topic is an ''arm,'' and pulling an arm (at a
cost) involves drawing a single example, evaluating it, and measuring its
difficulty. The goal is to efficiently identify the most difficult topics
within a fixed computational budget. We illustrate the bandit problem setup of
finding difficult examples for the task of machine translation. We find that
various bandit strategies vastly outperform baseline methods like brute-force
searching the most challenging topics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统口语语言模型使用高帧率标记，导致序列过长，Transformer的自注意力计算成本高昂。音节级标记化提供了更可解释且更可扩展的解决方案，但其在口语语言建模中的价值尚未充分探索。

Method: 对音节标记化进行系统性研究，在多个口语理解基准上评估模型，同时改变训练数据规模。比较音节标记与传统高帧率标记的性能和效率。

Result: 音节标记能够匹配或超越先前的高帧率标记，同时显著降低训练和推理成本：训练时间减少2倍以上，FLOPs减少5倍。

Conclusion: 音节级语言建模是实现高效长上下文口语语言模型的有前景路径。

Abstract: Spoken language models (SLMs) typically discretize speech into
high-frame-rate tokens extracted from SSL speech models. As the most successful
LMs are based on the Transformer architecture, processing these long token
streams with self-attention is expensive, as attention scales quadratically
with sequence length. A recent SSL work introduces acoustic tokenization of
speech at the syllable level, which is more interpretable and potentially more
scalable with significant compression in token lengths (4-5 Hz). Yet, their
value for spoken language modeling is not yet fully explored. We present the
first systematic study of syllabic tokenization for spoken language modeling,
evaluating models on a suite of SLU benchmarks while varying training data
scale. Syllabic tokens can match or surpass the previous high-frame rate tokens
while significantly cutting training and inference costs, achieving more than a
2x reduction in training time and a 5x reduction in FLOPs. Our findings
highlight syllable-level language modeling as a promising path to efficient
long-context spoken language models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究语言模型在不同随机种子下的收敛性，以了解训练过程中学习分布的稳定性。

Method: 通过测量不同随机种子下训练的模型的每标记KL散度来量化收敛性，分析模型大小、训练检查点、标记频率和词性标签对收敛的影响。

Result: 发现四阶段收敛模式：初始均匀阶段、急剧收敛阶段、急剧发散阶段和缓慢再收敛阶段；大模型在后期再收敛更快，小模型无法完全再收敛；高频标记和功能词比低频标记和内容词收敛更快更稳定。

Conclusion: 模型大小对学习稳定分布至关重要，收敛在不同语言类别中不均匀，这些发现有助于理解影响模型训练中学习分布稳定性的因素。

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the convergence of language models (LMs)
trained under different random seeds, measuring convergence as the expected
per-token Kullback--Leibler (KL) divergence across seeds. By comparing LM
convergence as a function of model size and training checkpoint, we identify a
four-phase convergence pattern: (i) an initial uniform phase, (ii) a
sharp-convergence phase, (iii) a sharp-divergence phase, and (iv) a
slow-reconvergence phase. Further, we observe that larger models reconverge
faster in later training stages, while smaller models never actually
reconverge; these results suggest that a certain model size may be necessary to
learn stable distributions. Restricting our analysis to specific token
frequencies or part-of-speech (PoS) tags further reveals that convergence is
uneven across linguistic categories: frequent tokens and function words
converge faster and more reliably than their counterparts (infrequent tokens
and content words). Overall, our findings highlight factors that influence the
stability of the learned distributions in model training.

Result: 构建了KGQAGen-10k基准，实验表明即使是SOTA系统在该基准上也表现困难，凸显了其暴露现有模型局限性的能力。

Conclusion: KGQAGen为KGQA评估提供了一个可扩展的框架，倡导更严格的基准构建标准。

Abstract: Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA) systems rely on high-quality
benchmarks to evaluate complex multi-hop reasoning. However, despite their
widespread use, popular datasets such as WebQSP and CWQ suffer from critical
quality issues, including inaccurate or incomplete ground-truth annotations,
poorly constructed questions that are ambiguous, trivial, or unanswerable, and
outdated or inconsistent knowledge. Through a manual audit of 16 popular KGQA
datasets, including WebQSP and CWQ, we find that the average factual
correctness rate is only 57 %. To address these issues, we introduce KGQAGen,
an LLM-in-the-loop framework that systematically resolves these pitfalls.
KGQAGen combines structured knowledge grounding, LLM-guided generation, and
symbolic verification to produce challenging and verifiable QA instances. Using
KGQAGen, we construct KGQAGen-10k, a ten-thousand scale benchmark grounded in
Wikidata, and evaluate a diverse set of KG-RAG models. Experimental results
demonstrate that even state-of-the-art systems struggle on this benchmark,
highlighting its ability to expose limitations of existing models. Our findings
advocate for more rigorous benchmark construction and position KGQAGen as a
scalable framework for advancing KGQA evaluation.

Conclusion: LLM-PDEveloper框架能够持续扩展PDE库的代码库、增强其能力并拓宽其范围，同时识别了某些语义错误的机制，为未来研究提供了指导。

Abstract: Foundation models -- large language models (LLMs) in particular -- have
become ubiquitous, shaping daily life and driving breakthroughs across science,
engineering, and technology. Harnessing their broad cross-domain knowledge,
text-processing, and reasoning abilities for software development, e.g.,
numerical libraries for solving partial differential equations (PDEs), is
therefore attracting growing interest. Yet existing studies mainly automate
case setup and execution for end users. We introduce LLM-PDEveloper, a
zero-shot, multi-agent LLM framework that automates code development for PDE
libraries, specifically targeting secondary developers. By translating
mathematical and algorithmic descriptions directly into source code,
LLM-PDEveloper generates new solvers/modules and adapts existing ones. This
end-to-end math-to-code approach enables a self-augmenting pipeline that
continuously expands the codebase of a library, extends its capacities, and
broadens its scope. We demonstrate LLM-PDEveloper on three tasks: 1) build a
solver for a new PDE, 2) implement new BCs for a given PDE, and 3) modify an
existing solver to incorporate additional terms, achieving moderate success
rates. Failures due to syntactic errors made by LLMs are analyzed and we
propose effective fixes. We also identify the mechanisms underlying certain
semantic errors, guiding future research.

Method: 对91位ML从业者进行全球调查，收集关于当前ML系统监控实践的多样化见解，进行定性和定量分析。

Result: 从业者经常面临模型性能下降、延迟超时和安全违规等运行时问题；大多数偏好自动化监控但许多仍依赖手动方法；监控工具初始设置复杂，增加工作负担并导致警报疲劳。

Conclusion: 从业者期望的改进包括：监控器的自动生成和部署、改进性能和公平性监控支持、以及运行时问题解决建议，这些见解为未来开发更符合从业者需求的ML监控工具提供了宝贵指导。

Abstract: Given the inherent non-deterministic nature of machine learning (ML) systems,
their behavior in production environments can lead to unforeseen and
potentially dangerous outcomes. For a timely detection of unwanted behavior and
to prevent organizations from financial and reputational damage, monitoring
these systems is essential. This paper explores the strategies, challenges, and
improvement opportunities for monitoring ML systems from the practitioners
perspective. We conducted a global survey of 91 ML practitioners to collect
diverse insights into current monitoring practices for ML systems. We aim to
complement existing research through our qualitative and quantitative analyses,
focusing on prevalent runtime issues, industrial monitoring and mitigation
practices, key challenges, and desired enhancements in future monitoring tools.
Our findings reveal that practitioners frequently struggle with runtime issues
related to declining model performance, exceeding latency, and security
violations. While most prefer automated monitoring for its increased
efficiency, many still rely on manual approaches due to the complexity or lack
of appropriate automation solutions. Practitioners report that the initial
setup and configuration of monitoring tools is often complicated and
challenging, particularly when integrating with ML systems and setting alert
thresholds. Moreover, practitioners find that monitoring adds extra workload,
strains resources, and causes alert fatigue. The desired improvements from the
practitioners perspective are: automated generation and deployment of monitors,
improved support for performance and fairness monitoring, and recommendations
for resolving runtime issues. These insights offer valuable guidance for the
future development of ML monitoring tools that are better aligned with
practitioners needs.

### [229] [APRIL: API Synthesis with Automatic Prompt Optimization and Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25196)
*Hua Zhong,Shan Jiang,Sarfraz Khurshid*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: APRIL结合自动提示优化和基于验证奖励的强化学习，显著提升了大型语言模型在API合成任务中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统组件合成方法搜索空间大且依赖手工规范，而LLM生成代码存在幻觉和上下文信息不足的问题，需要更可靠的API合成方案。

Method: 采用自动提示优化迭代改进提示，同时使用基于验证奖励的强化学习微调模型策略，确保功能正确性。

Result: 在81个真实世界科学Python库API上的评估显示，APRIL相比仅使用专家提示的指令调优LLM有显著改进。

Conclusion: APO和RLVR的结合为大型库中的组件式API合成提供了稳健、可扩展的路径。

Abstract: APIs are central to modern software development, yet composing new APIs from
large libraries is difficult due to the exponential search space; traditional
component-based synthesis relies on costly exploration and hand-crafted
specifications. While large language models (LLMs) can generate implementations
from natural language, hallucinations and limited access to up-to-date
contextual information often yield incorrect code. In this paper, we present
APRIL, an approach that combines LLM-based synthesis with Automatic Prompt
Optimization (APO) and Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR):
APO iteratively refines prompts for a frozen model, while RLVR fine-tunes the
policy toward functional correctness, producing an efficient synthesis
pipeline. Evaluated on 81 real-world APIs from widely used scientific Python
libraries and benchmarked against instruction-tuned but unfine-tuned LLMs
guided by expert prompts, APRIL achieves substantial improvements. These
results indicate that integrating APO and RLVR provides a robust, scalable path
for component-based API synthesis in large libraries.

TL;DR: RVBench是首个专门为仓库级验证设计的基准测试，RagVerus框架结合检索增强生成和上下文感知提示，显著提高了多模块代码库的证明合成效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM方法主要关注孤立的函数级验证任务，忽略了跨模块依赖和全局上下文等关键挑战，难以扩展到真实世界项目的自动化形式验证。

Method: 引入RVBench验证基准，构建RagVerus框架，结合检索增强生成和上下文感知提示来自动化多模块仓库的证明合成。

Result: RagVerus在受限模型推理预算下将现有基准的证明通过率提高了三倍，在更具挑战性的RVBench基准上实现了27%的相对改进。

Conclusion: RagVerus提供了一个可扩展且样本高效的验证解决方案，能够有效处理仓库级的形式验证挑战。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) suggest great promises in
code and proof generations. However, scaling automated formal verification to
real-world projects requires resolving cross-module dependencies and global
contexts, which are crucial challenges overlooked by existing LLM-based methods
with a special focus on targeting isolated, function-level verification tasks.
To systematically explore and address the significant challenges of verifying
entire software repositories, we introduce RVBench, the first verification
benchmark explicitly designed for repository-level evaluation, constructed from
four diverse and complex open-source Verus projects.
  We further introduce RagVerus, an extensible framework that synergizes
retrieval-augmented generation with context-aware prompting to automate proof
synthesis for multi-module repositories. RagVerus triples proof pass rates on
existing benchmarks under constrained model inference budgets, and achieves a
27% relative improvement on the more challenging RVBench benchmark,
demonstrating a scalable and sample-efficient verification solution.

TL;DR: 提出了CanItEdit开源流水线，利用多个LLM合成真实的代码编辑三元组，构建了OCEDataFT数据集（20K样本），微调后模型在代码编辑任务上性能显著提升，接近闭源系统性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于提交的数据集存在噪声大、多样性不足、不能反映真实世界编辑指令风格的问题，需要构建更高质量的代码编辑数据集。

Method: 开发CanItEdit流水线，使用多个LLM合成代码编辑三元组，生成简洁和详细两种指令，基于差异和主题进行过滤以保证数据质量和多样性。

Result: 构建了OCEDataFT数据集（20K样本），微调三个先进基础模型后，在CanItEdit基准测试中pass@1相对提升4.50%-20.79%，与GPT-4的差距缩小到仅3.54%。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效提升代码编辑模型的性能，无需依赖专有资源或人工标注即可接近闭源系统的表现。

Abstract: Code editing plays a vital role in software engineering, requiring developers
to adjust existing code according to natural language instructions while
keeping functionality intact and avoiding unnecessary modifications. However,
commit-based datasets commonly used for this task are often noisy, lack
diversity, and fail to reflect the style of real-world edit instructions. To
address this, we introduce CanItEdit, an open-source pipeline that leverages
multiple LLMs to synthesize realistic code-edit triplets. The pipeline produces
both concise "lazy" instructions and more detailed "descriptive" ones, and
applies filtering based on diffs and topics to guarantee data quality and
variety. Using this process, we construct OCEDataFT, a curated dataset of 20K
samples. Fine-tuning three advanced base models on OCEDataFT leads to
significant performance boosts on the CanItEdit benchmark, with relative pass@1
improvements ranging from 4.50% to 20.79%. Notably, the resulting models
achieve performance close to closed-source systems, narrowing the gap to GPT-4
to just 3.54%, without relying on proprietary resources or manual annotation.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 提出了MULocBench数据集，包含1100个GitHub Python项目问题，用于评估问题定位方法，发现现有方法在文件级性能指标低于40%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有问题定位基准（如SWE-Bench和LocBench）主要关注拉取请求问题和代码位置，忽略了其他证据和非代码文件，需要更全面的评估基准。

Method: 构建包含46个流行GitHub Python项目的1100个问题的数据集，评估最先进的定位方法和5种基于LLM的提示策略。

Result: 当前技术在文件级别的性能指标（Acc@5, F1）均低于40%，显示出在现实多面问题解决中的泛化挑战。

Conclusion: MULocBench为问题解决中的项目定位研究提供了更现实的测试平台，揭示了当前技术的显著局限性。

Abstract: Accurate project localization (e.g., files and functions) for issue
resolution is a critical first step in software maintenance. However, existing
benchmarks for issue localization, such as SWE-Bench and LocBench, are limited.
They focus predominantly on pull-request issues and code locations, ignoring
other evidence and non-code files such as commits, comments, configurations,
and documentation. To address this gap, we introduce MULocBench, a
comprehensive dataset of 1,100 issues from 46 popular GitHub Python projects.
Comparing with existing benchmarks, MULocBench offers greater diversity in
issue types, root causes, location scopes, and file types, providing a more
realistic testbed for evaluation. Using this benchmark, we assess the
performance of state-of-the-art localization methods and five LLM-based
prompting strategies. Our results reveal significant limitations in current
techniques: even at the file level, performance metrics (Acc@5, F1) remain
below 40%. This underscores the challenge of generalizing to realistic,
multi-faceted issue resolution. To enable future research on project
localization for issue resolution, we publicly release MULocBench at
https://huggingface.co/datasets/somethingone/MULocBench.

*Xunzhu Tang,Iyiola Emmanuel Olatunji,Tiezhu Sun,Jacques Klein,Tegawende F. Bissyande*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 提出了MultiCoD框架，使用强化学习从Chain-of-Draft生成的多个候选方案中选择最优解，在保持性能的同时显著降低用户成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在代码生成中表面流畅但结构化推理能力不足，现有方法如CoT冗长低效，CoD虽然简洁但随机性导致质量不稳定，需要更好的解决方案选择机制。

Method: 采用策略引导提示鼓励多样化推理风格，将解决方案选择建模为上下文多臂赌博机问题，通过奖励函数优化代码复杂度、推理结构和战略元数据等可解释特征。

Result: 在MBPP、BigCodeBench、SWE-bench Verified和Defects4J等基准测试中，MultiCoD优于或与标准提示、CoT和CoD基线相当，同时用户计费减少50%以上。

Conclusion: MultiCoD通过多候选设计仅对选定输出收费，在提高LLM响应质量的同时实现成本和token效率，为实际部署提供了更可持续和可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: LLMs demonstrate surface-level fluency in code generation but struggle with
structured reasoning tasks requiring correctness and semantic alignment. While
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting enhances reasoning through intermediate steps,
it suffers from verbosity and inefficiency. Chain-of-Draft (CoD) prompting
offers more concise reasoning, but the stochastic nature of LLMs produces
varying solution quality, making optimal selection challenging. We propose
\multicod, a reinforcement learning framework that learns to select the most
promising candidate from CoD-generated solutions. Our approach uses
strategy-guided prompting to encourage diverse reasoning styles and models
solution selection as a contextual bandit problem. The framework optimizes
interpretable features including code complexity, reasoning structure, and
strategic metadata through a reward function balancing correctness, efficiency,
and clarity. Experiments on MBPP, BigCodeBench, SWE-bench Verified, and
Defects4J show \multicod~outperforms and in some cases, on par with standard
prompting, CoT, and CoD baselines while achieving cost and token efficiency
from the user's perspective through a multi-candidate design that charges only
for the selected output, reducing user billing by over 50\% and improving LLM
response quality, making \multicod~more sustainable and scalable for real-world
deployment. Our code is available: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/MultiCoD.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 本文研究如何通过自动采样上下文学习(ICL)演示来提升大语言模型在代码生成任务中的性能和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在代码生成中的广泛应用，虽然提高了开发效率，但也带来了次优解决方案和不安全代码的风险。需要改进ICL演示的选择来提升模型性能。

Method: 使用基于抽象语法树(AST)的分析方法，在MBPP测试集上识别受演示影响最大的代码区域，自动采样高质量的ICL演示。

Result: 高质量ICL演示不仅使输出更易解释，还在pass@10指标上带来正向性能提升；而低质量演示则会对性能产生负面影响。

Conclusion: 高效的ICL采样策略对模型性能至关重要，能够显著影响模型在特定任务上的表现。

Abstract: Since the introduction of Large Language Models (LLMs), they have been widely
adopted for various tasks such as text summarization, question answering,
speech-to-text translation, and more. In recent times, the use of LLMs for code
generation has gained significant attention, with tools such as Cursor and
Windsurf demonstrating the ability to analyze massive code repositories and
recommend relevant changes. Big tech companies have also acknowledged the
growing reliance on LLMs for code generation within their codebases. Although
these advances significantly improve developer productivity, increasing
reliance on automated code generation can proportionally increase the risk of
suboptimal solutions and insecure code. Our work focuses on automatically
sampling In-Context Learning (ICL) demonstrations which can improve model
performance and enhance the interpretability of the generated code. Using
AST-based analysis on outputs from the MBPP test set, we identify regions of
code most influenced by the chosen demonstrations. In our experiments, we show
that high-quality ICL demonstrations not only make outputs easier to interpret
but also yield a positive performance improvement on the pass@10 metric.
Conversely, poorly chosen ICL demonstrations affected the LLM performance on
the pass@10 metric negatively compared to the base model. Overall, our approach
highlights the importance of efficient sampling strategies for ICL, which can
affect the performance of the model on any given task.

TL;DR: 提出了一个更挑战性的开源软件编译基准BUILD-BENCH和一个基于LLM的智能体OSS-BUILD-AGENT，用于解决真实世界中复杂的软件编译问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的开源软件编译方法依赖人工制定的规则和工作流，无法适应需要定制配置或环境设置的开源软件。现有LLM方法只在高质量开源软件子集上进行评估，低估了实际编译挑战。

Method: 提出OSS-BUILD-AGENT智能体系统，包含增强的构建指令检索模块，能够适应异构开源软件特性。

Result: OSS-BUILD-AGENT在BUILD-BENCH基准上实现了最先进的性能表现。

Conclusion: BUILD-BENCH能够真实反映智能体处理复杂软件工程任务的能力，该基准将推动软件开发和软件安全领域的创新。

Abstract: Automatically compiling open-source software (OSS) projects is a vital,
labor-intensive, and complex task, which makes it a good challenge for LLM
Agents. Existing methods rely on manually curated rules and workflows, which
cannot adapt to OSS that requires customized configuration or environment
setup. Recent attempts using Large Language Models (LLMs) used selective
evaluation on a subset of highly rated OSS, a practice that underestimates the
realistic challenges of OSS compilation. In practice, compilation instructions
are often absent, dependencies are undocumented, and successful builds may even
require patching source files or modifying build scripts. We propose a more
challenging and realistic benchmark, BUILD-BENCH, comprising OSS that are more
diverse in quality, scale, and characteristics. Furthermore, we propose a
strong baseline LLM-based agent, OSS-BUILD-AGENT, an effective system with
enhanced build instruction retrieval module that achieves state-of-the-art
performance on BUILD-BENCH and is adaptable to heterogeneous OSS
characteristics. We also provide detailed analysis regarding different
compilation method design choices and their influence to the whole task,
offering insights to guide future advances. We believe performance on
BUILD-BENCH can faithfully reflect an agent's ability to tackle compilation as
a complex software engineering tasks, and, as such, our benchmark will spur
innovation with a significant impact on downstream applications in the fields
of software development and software security.

*Pratik Shah,Rajat Ghosh,Aryan Singhal,Debojyoti Dutta*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: RANGER是一个仓库级代码检索代理，能够处理代码实体查询和自然语言查询，通过构建知识图谱和双阶段检索管道，在多个代码检索任务中优于现有基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的代码检索系统主要关注代码实体查询，但实际软件工程任务需要同时处理代码实体查询和自然语言查询，因此需要开发能够处理这两种查询类型的通用代码检索系统。

Method: 首先构建包含整个仓库层次结构和跨文件依赖关系的知识图谱，节点包含文本描述和嵌入表示；然后采用双阶段检索管道：代码实体查询通过Cypher查询快速处理，自然语言查询通过MCTS引导的图探索处理。

Result: 在CodeSearchNet和RepoQA上优于使用Qwen3-8B等强模型嵌入的检索基线；在RepoBench上实现更好的跨文件依赖检索；在CrossCodeEval上与BM25结合获得最高的代码补全精确匹配率。

Conclusion: RANGER填补了现有代码检索系统主要关注代码实体查询的空白，通过知识图谱和双阶段检索策略，能够有效处理多种软件工程任务中的代码检索需求。

Abstract: General-purpose automated software engineering (ASE) includes tasks such as
code completion, retrieval, repair, QA, and summarization. These tasks require
a code retrieval system that can handle specific queries about code entities,
or code entity queries (for example, locating a specific class or retrieving
the dependencies of a function), as well as general queries without explicit
code entities, or natural language queries (for example, describing a task and
retrieving the corresponding code). We present RANGER, a repository-level code
retrieval agent designed to address both query types, filling a gap in recent
works that have focused primarily on code-entity queries. We first present a
tool that constructs a comprehensive knowledge graph of the entire repository,
capturing hierarchical and cross-file dependencies down to the variable level,
and augments graph nodes with textual descriptions and embeddings to bridge the
gap between code and natural language. RANGER then operates on this graph
through a dual-stage retrieval pipeline. Entity-based queries are answered
through fast Cypher lookups, while natural language queries are handled by
MCTS-guided graph exploration. We evaluate RANGER across four diverse
benchmarks that represent core ASE tasks including code search, question
answering, cross-file dependency retrieval, and repository-level code
completion. On CodeSearchNet and RepoQA it outperforms retrieval baselines that
use embeddings from strong models such as Qwen3-8B. On RepoBench, it achieves
superior cross-file dependency retrieval over baselines, and on CrossCodeEval,
pairing RANGER with BM25 delivers the highest exact match rate in code
completion compared to other RAG methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的多模态大语言模型只能生成前端网页，无法创建功能完整的全栈应用。全栈开发需要跨技术栈的专业知识，过程复杂耗时，需要自动化解决方案。

Method: 采用测试驱动开发方法，自动生成可执行测试用例，生成前后端代码，模拟用户交互，并通过迭代优化直到满足所有需求。

Result: 在多样化应用场景的实验中，TDDev相比最先进基线方法在整体准确率上提升了14.4%，能够生成可靠、高质量的Web应用而无需人工干预。

Conclusion: TDDev框架成功解决了全栈自动化中的关键挑战，包括需求不明确、多文件复杂依赖关系，以及功能正确性和视觉保真度的需求，证明了其在生成完整Web应用方面的有效性。

Abstract: Developing full-stack web applications is complex and time-intensive,
demanding proficiency across diverse technologies and frameworks. Although
recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) enable automated
webpage generation from visual inputs, current solutions remain limited to
front-end tasks and fail to deliver fully functional applications. In this
work, we introduce TDDev, the first test-driven development (TDD)-enabled
LLM-agent framework for end-to-end full-stack web application generation. Given
a natural language description or design image, TDDev automatically derives
executable test cases, generates front-end and back-end code, simulates user
interactions, and iteratively refines the implementation until all requirements
are satisfied. Our framework addresses key challenges in full-stack automation,
including underspecified user requirements, complex interdependencies among
multiple files, and the need for both functional correctness and visual
fidelity. Through extensive experiments on diverse application scenarios, TDDev
achieves a 14.4% improvement on overall accuracy compared to state-of-the-art
baselines, demonstrating its effectiveness in producing reliable, high-quality
web applications without requiring manual intervention.

TL;DR: DSCHECKER是一个基于LLM的方法，用于检测和修复数据科学库中的API误用，通过整合API指令和数据信息来提高性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数据科学库（如scikit-learn和pandas）的数据中心特性使得API误用检测更具挑战性，需要专门的方法来解决这个问题。

Method: 使用三个LLM和来自五个数据科学库的误用案例进行实验，设计了包含API指令和数据特定细节的提示策略，并实现了具有自适应函数调用机制的DSCHECKER代理。

Result: 最佳模型实现了61.18%的检测F1分数和51.28%的误用修复率；DSCHECKER代理在真实场景下达到48.65%检测F1分数和39.47%修复率。

Conclusion: LLM-based方法在数据科学库API误用检测和修复方面显示出潜力，特别是在整合API指令和数据信息的情况下。

Abstract: Data science libraries, such as scikit-learn and pandas, specialize in
processing and manipulating data. The data-centric nature of these libraries
makes the detection of API misuse in them more challenging. This paper
introduces DSCHECKER, an LLM-based approach designed for detecting and fixing
API misuses of data science libraries. We identify two key pieces of
information, API directives and data information, that may be beneficial for
API misuse detection and fixing. Using three LLMs and misuses from five data
science libraries, we experiment with various prompts. We find that
incorporating API directives and data-specific details enhances Dschecker's
ability to detect and fix API misuses, with the best-performing model achieving
a detection F1-score of 61.18 percent and fixing 51.28 percent of the misuses.
Building on these results, we implement Dschecker agent which includes an
adaptive function calling mechanism to access information on demand, simulating
a real-world setting where information about the misuse is unknown in advance.
We find that Dschecker agent achieves 48.65 percent detection F1-score and
fixes 39.47 percent of the misuses, demonstrating the promise of LLM-based API
misuse detection and fixing in real-world scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前开源大语言模型蓬勃发展，但其开发过程中的协作方式、组织模式和治理机制尚未得到系统研究，限制了我们对如何更好支持这一生态系统的理解。

Method: 采用探索性分析方法，通过对北美、欧洲、非洲和亚洲的14个开源LLM项目（包括草根项目、研究机构、初创公司和大型科技公司）的开发者进行半结构化访谈。

Result: 研究发现：1）开源LLM项目的协作范围远超模型本身，涵盖数据集、基准测试、开源框架等；2）开发者具有多样化的社会、经济和技术动机；3）存在五种不同的组织模型，在控制集中度和社区参与策略上各有特点。

Conclusion: 研究为寻求支持全球社区构建更开放AI未来的利益相关者提供了实用建议，强调了协作生态系统的多样性和复杂性。

Abstract: The proliferation of open large language models (LLMs) is fostering a vibrant
ecosystem of research and innovation in artificial intelligence (AI). However,
the methods of collaboration used to develop open LLMs both before and after
their public release have not yet been comprehensively studied, limiting our
understanding of how open LLM projects are initiated, organized, and governed
as well as what opportunities there are to foster this ecosystem even further.
We address this gap through an exploratory analysis of open collaboration
throughout the development and reuse lifecycle of open LLMs, drawing on
semi-structured interviews with the developers of 14 open LLMs from grassroots
projects, research institutes, startups, and Big Tech companies in North
America, Europe, Africa, and Asia. We make three key contributions to research
and practice. First, collaboration in open LLM projects extends far beyond the
LLMs themselves, encompassing datasets, benchmarks, open source frameworks,
leaderboards, knowledge sharing and discussion forums, and compute
partnerships, among others. Second, open LLM developers have a variety of
social, economic, and technological motivations, from democratizing AI access
and promoting open science to building regional ecosystems and expanding
language representation. Third, the sampled open LLM projects exhibit five
distinct organizational models, ranging from single company projects to
non-profit-sponsored grassroots projects, which vary in their centralization of
control and community engagement strategies used throughout the open LLM
lifecycle. We conclude with practical recommendations for stakeholders seeking
to support the global community building a more open future for AI.

Motivation: 当前搜索技术仅限于标准RAG查询-文档应用，存在API泄露问题，且无法处理企业特定代码中API使用意图不明确的情况。

Method: 构建基于真实ServiceNow脚本的新数据集，开发包含合成数据集生成、监督微调和强化学习的后训练流程，优化0.6B紧凑重排器。

Result: 在API预测方面达到87.86%的top-40检索准确率，紧凑重排器性能优于8B模型，延迟降低2.5倍。

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了企业特定代码的细微差别，无需大型模型的计算开销，为自动补全和智能AI应用提供了高质量的端到端代码生成能力。

Abstract: Current search techniques are limited to standard RAG query-document
applications. In this paper, we propose a novel technique to expand the code
and index for predicting the required APIs, directly enabling high-quality,
end-to-end code generation for auto-completion and agentic AI applications. We
address the problem of API leaks in current code-to-code benchmark datasets by
introducing a new dataset built from real-world ServiceNow Script Includes that
capture the challenge of unclear API usage intent in the code. Our evaluation
metrics show that this method achieves 87.86% top-40 retrieval accuracy,
allowing the critical context with APIs needed for successful downstream code
generation. To enable real-time predictions, we develop a comprehensive

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种结合监督微调和强化学习的专门模型，用于自动化软件工程中的环境设置任务，使较小的模型在性能上能与大型模型相媲美。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 环境设置在软件工程中是一个持续存在的挑战，自动化环境设置方法可以帮助开发者无需手动配置即可为任意代码库提供完全配置的环境，同时也有助于软件工程研究人员扩展基于执行的基准测试。

Method: 结合监督微调生成正确的Bash脚本，并使用带可验证奖励的强化学习来适应环境设置任务。

Result: 在EnvBench-Python基准测试中，该方法使Qwen3-8B模型（可在消费级硬件上运行）的性能与更大的Qwen3-32B和GPT-4o模型相当。

Conclusion: 通过专门的任务调优，较小的模型可以在环境设置任务上达到与大型模型相当的性能，这为自动化软件工程任务提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Environment setup-the process of configuring the system to work with a
specific software project-represents a persistent challenge in Software
Engineering (SE). Automated environment setup methods could assist developers
by providing fully configured environments for arbitrary repositories without
manual effort. This also helps SE researchers to scale execution-based
benchmarks. However, recent studies reveal that even state-of-the-art Large
Language Models (LLMs) achieve limited success in automating this task. To
address this limitation, we tune a specialized model for environment setup. We
combine supervised fine-tuning for generating correct Bash scripts and
Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) to adapt it to the task
of environment setup. On EnvBench-Python, our method enables Qwen3-8B (a model
runnable on consumer hardware) to perform on par with larger models-Qwen3-32B
and GPT-4o. The training code and model checkpoints are available online:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 项目管理工具通常需要复杂编程语言来检索数据，学习曲线陡峭。项目经理需要更直观的方式来处理大量项目数据。

Method: 开发JiraGPT Next作为Jira插件，利用GPT大语言模型提供自然语言接口，让用户可以用自然语言查询项目信息。

Result: 评估了GPT在此场景下的准确性，包括不同提示对完成特定任务的影响。

Conclusion: JiraGPT Next通过自然语言界面简化了项目经理处理大量数据的过程，提高了工作效率。

Abstract: In the domain of Project Management, the sheer volume of data is a challenge
that project managers continually have to deal with. Effectively steering
projects from inception to completion requires handling of diverse information
streams, including timelines, budgetary considerations, and task dependencies.
To navigate this data-driven landscape with precision and agility, project
managers must rely on efficient and sophisticated tools. These tools have
become essential, as they enable project managers to streamline communication,
optimize resource allocation, and make informed decisions in real-time.
However, many of these tools have steep learning curves and require using
complex programming languages to retrieve the exact data that project managers
need. In this work we present JiraGPT Next, a software that uses the GPT Large
Language Model to ease the process by which project managers deal with large
amounts of data. It is conceived as an add-on for Jira, one of the most popular
Project Management tools, and provides a natural language interface to retrieve
information. This work presents the design decisions behind JiraGPT Next and an
evaluation of the accuracy of GPT in this context, including the effects of
providing different prompts to complete a particular task.

TL;DR: 提出了BloomAPR框架，基于布鲁姆分类学动态评估LLM驱动的自动程序修复能力，发现现有方法在记忆层面表现良好但缺乏高级推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于静态基准（如Defects4J）的评估存在数据污染风险，且无法评估LLM在动态多样化环境中的程序修复能力。

Method: 开发BloomAPR动态评估框架，使用Defects4J作为案例研究，评估ChatRepair和CigaR在GPT-3.5-Turbo、Llama-3.1和StarCoder-2上的表现。

Result: LLM驱动的修复方案在记忆层面表现最佳（修复81.57%错误），但在理解层面需要合成错误提升性能（增加60.66%），在应用层面表现较差（修复43.32%），在分析真实项目时表现最差（仅修复13.46%-41.34%错误）。

Conclusion: 现有基准需要演进，BloomAPR为更可信的LLM软件工程解决方案评估提供了基础。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have accelerated the
development of AI-driven automated program repair (APR) solutions. However,
these solutions are typically evaluated using static benchmarks such as
Defects4J and SWE-bench, which suffer from two key limitations: (1) the risk of
data contamination, potentially inflating evaluation results due to overlap
with LLM training data, and (2) limited ability to assess the APR capabilities
in dynamic and diverse contexts. In this paper, we introduced BloomAPR, a novel
dynamic evaluation framework grounded in Bloom's Taxonomy. Our framework offers
a structured approach to assess the cognitive capabilities of LLM-powered APR
solutions across progressively complex reasoning levels. Using Defects4J as a
case study, we evaluated two state-of-the-art LLM-powered APR solutions,
ChatRepair and CigaR, under three different LLMs: GPT-3.5-Turbo, Llama-3.1, and
StarCoder-2. Our findings show that while these solutions exhibit basic
reasoning skills and effectively memorize bug-fixing patterns (fixing up to
81.57% of bugs at the Remember layer), their performance increases with
synthetically generated bugs (up to 60.66% increase at the Understand layer).
However, they perform worse on minor syntactic changes (fixing up to 43.32% at
the Apply layer), and they struggle to repair similar bugs when injected into
real-world projects (solving only 13.46% to 41.34% bugs at the Analyze layer).
These results underscore the urgent need for evolving benchmarks and provide a
foundation for more trustworthy evaluation of LLM-powered software engineering
solutions.

TL;DR: AGNOMIN是一种架构无关的多标签函数名预测方法，通过构建特征增强层次图和使用层次图神经网络，在剥离二进制文件中实现跨架构的函数名预测，显著提升了安全评估的可扩展性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在软件逆向工程中面临架构特定限制、数据稀缺和命名约定多样性的挑战，而函数名预测对于后续漏洞分析和补丁至关重要。

Method: 构建特征增强层次图（FEHGs），结合控制流图、函数调用图和动态学习的PCode特征，使用层次图神经网络生成跨架构一致的函数表示，并采用Renée启发式解码器进行函数名预测。

Result: 在9,000个ELF可执行二进制文件上的评估显示，AGNOMIN在测试数据集上的精确度提升高达27.17%，召回率提升55.86%，在未见架构上比最接近的基线方法召回率高5.89%。

Conclusion: AGNOMIN在安全黑客松中成功帮助逆向工程师分析和修补不同架构的易受攻击二进制文件，证明了其实际效用和跨架构泛化能力。

Abstract: Function name prediction is crucial for understanding stripped binaries in
software reverse engineering, a key step for \textbf{enabling subsequent
vulnerability analysis and patching}. However, existing approaches often
struggle with architecture-specific limitations, data scarcity, and diverse
naming conventions. We present AGNOMIN, a novel architecture-agnostic approach
for multi-label function name prediction in stripped binaries. AGNOMIN builds
Feature-Enriched Hierarchical Graphs (FEHGs), combining Control Flow Graphs,
Function Call Graphs, and dynamically learned \texttt{PCode} features. A
hierarchical graph neural network processes this enriched structure to generate
consistent function representations across architectures, vital for
\textbf{scalable security assessments}. For function name prediction, AGNOMIN
employs a Ren\'ee-inspired decoder, enhanced with an attention-based head layer
and algorithmic improvements.
  We evaluate AGNOMIN on a comprehensive dataset of 9,000 ELF executable
binaries across three architectures, demonstrating its superior performance
compared to state-of-the-art approaches, with improvements of up to 27.17\% in
precision and 55.86\% in recall across the testing dataset. Moreover, AGNOMIN
generalizes well to unseen architectures, achieving 5.89\% higher recall than
the closest baseline. AGNOMIN's practical utility has been validated through
security hackathons, where it successfully aided reverse engineers in analyzing
and patching vulnerable binaries across different architectures.

Abstract: The advent of increasingly complex and dynamic ecosystems, such as digital
twins (DT), smart cities and Industry 4.0 and 5.0, has made evident the need to
include modeling and simulation (M&S) in the software development life cycle.
Such disruptive systems include simulation models in their own architecture
(such as DT) or require the use of simulation models to represent the high
degree of movement and the multiplicity of interactions that occur between the
involved systems. However, when software engineers (particularly the newcomers)
need to use M&S in their projects, they often pose themselves an important
question: which formalism should I use? In this direction, the main
contribution of this paper is the establishment of a preliminary checklist with
questions to assist beginners in M&S in choosing the most appropriate paradigm
to solve their problems. The checklist is based on three main formalisms: DEVS,
System Dynamics and Agent-Based Simulation. A pilot study was carried out and
an expert was consulted. The preliminary results show (i) conformance between
the suggestion given by the checklist and the formalism selected in the
original studies used as input for evaluating the checklist, and (ii) a
positive feedback from the expert.

Motivation: 现有故障定位技术在教育环境中面临挑战：方法级定位粒度太粗，缺乏解释性反馈；行级定位方法直接预测行号不适合LLM。需要为编程作业提供细粒度、可解释的故障定位。

Method: FLAME利用编程作业的丰富上下文信息引导LLM识别错误代码行，通过注释而非直接预测行号的方式，结合加权多模型投票策略聚合多个LLM的结果。

Result: FLAME在编程作业上优于最先进的故障定位基线方法，在top-1定位中成功定位了比最佳基线多207个错误。在Defects4J基准测试中也优于所有基线。

Conclusion: FLAME为编程作业提供了有效的细粒度故障定位，具有教育价值，并能泛化到通用软件代码库中。

Abstract: Providing timely and personalized guidance for students' programming
assignments, offers significant practical value for helping students complete
assignments and enhance their learning. In recent years, various automated
Fault Localization (FL) techniques have demonstrated promising results in
identifying errors in programs. However, existing FL techniques face challenges
when applied to educational contexts. Most approaches operate at the method
level without explanatory feedback, resulting in granularity too coarse for
students who need actionable insights to identify and fix their errors. While
some approaches attempt line-level fault localization, they often depend on
predicting line numbers directly in numerical form, which is ill-suited to
LLMs. To address these challenges, we propose FLAME, a fine-grained,
explainable Fault Localization method tailored for programming assignments via
LLM-guided Annotation and Model Ensemble. FLAME leverages rich contextual
information specific to programming assignments to guide LLMs in identifying
faulty code lines. Instead of directly predicting line numbers, we prompt the
LLM to annotate faulty code lines with detailed explanations, enhancing both
localization accuracy and educational value. To further improve reliability, we
introduce a weighted multi-model voting strategy that aggregates results from
multiple LLMs to determine the suspiciousness of each code line. Extensive
experimental results demonstrate that FLAME outperforms state-of-the-art fault
localization baselines on programming assignments, successfully localizing 207
more faults at top-1 over the best-performing baseline. Beyond educational
contexts, FLAME also generalizes effectively to general-purpose software
codebases, outperforming all baselines on the Defects4J benchmark.

Motivation: AI生成代码的普及带来了语法和语义上的变化，这对传统代码克隆检测工具提出了新挑战，需要评估这些工具在新范式下的有效性。

Method: 使用GPTCloneBench基准测试9种广泛使用的代码克隆检测工具，并在BigCloneBench和SemanticCloneBench等传统基准上进行对比验证。

Result: 经典代码克隆检测工具，特别是经过规范化技术增强的工具，对AI生成的克隆代码仍保持相当有效性，但部分工具相比传统基准表现出显著性能变化。

Conclusion: 规范化技术在提高检测准确性方面发挥重要作用，研究为实际代码克隆检测工具选择提供了详细的扩展性和执行时间分析支持。

Abstract: The increasing adoption of AI-generated code has reshaped modern software
development, introducing syntactic and semantic variations in cloned code.
Unlike traditional human-written clones, AI-generated clones exhibit systematic
syntactic patterns and semantic differences learned from large-scale training
data. This shift presents new challenges for classical code clone detection
(CCD) tools, which have historically been validated primarily on human-authored
codebases and optimized to detect syntactic (Type 1-3) and limited semantic
clones. Given that AI-generated code can produce both syntactic and complex
semantic clones, it is essential to evaluate the effectiveness of classical CCD
tools within this new paradigm. In this paper, we systematically evaluate nine
widely used CCD tools using GPTCloneBench, a benchmark containing
GPT-3-generated clones. To contextualize and validate our results, we further
test these detectors on established human-authored benchmarks, BigCloneBench
and SemanticCloneBench, to measure differences in performance between
traditional and AI-generated clones. Our analysis demonstrates that classical
CCD tools, particularly those enhanced by effective normalization techniques,
retain considerable effectiveness against AI-generated clones, while some
exhibit notable performance variation compared to traditional benchmarks. This
paper contributes by (1) evaluating classical CCD tools against AI-generated
clones, providing critical insights into their current strengths and
limitations; (2) highlighting the role of normalization techniques in improving
detection accuracy; and (3) delivering detailed scalability and execution-time
analyses to support practical CCD tool selection.

TL;DR: LogPilot是一个基于大语言模型的自动化日志诊断框架，通过意图感知和可扩展的方法解决大规模在线服务系统的告警诊断问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的自动化工具在实践中效果不佳，主要因为告警无关的日志范围界定和无法有效组织复杂数据以进行推理。工程师需要手动检查大量日志来定位根本原因，负担沉重。

Method: LogPilot采用意图感知方法，通过解析告警定义（如PromQL）来精确识别因果相关的日志和请求。为实现可扩展性，它将每个请求的执行重构为时空日志链，聚类相似链以识别重复执行模式，并为LLMs提供代表性样本进行诊断。

Result: 在火山引擎云的真实告警上评估，LogPilot相比最先进方法，将根本原因总结的有用性提高了50.34%，精确定位准确率提高了54.79%。每个告警的诊断时间不到一分钟，成本仅为0.074美元。

Conclusion: LogPilot已成功在生产环境中部署，为服务告警诊断提供了一个自动化且实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Effective alert diagnosis is essential for ensuring the reliability of
large-scale online service systems. However, on-call engineers are often
burdened with manually inspecting massive volumes of logs to identify root
causes. While various automated tools have been proposed, they struggle in
practice due to alert-agnostic log scoping and the inability to organize
complex data effectively for reasoning. To overcome these limitations, we
introduce LogPilot, an intent-aware and scalable framework powered by Large
Language Models (LLMs) for automated log-based alert diagnosis. LogPilot
introduces an intent-aware approach, interpreting the logic in alert
definitions (e.g., PromQL) to precisely identify causally related logs and
requests. To achieve scalability, it reconstructs each request's execution into
a spatiotemporal log chain, clusters similar chains to identify recurring
execution patterns, and provides representative samples to the LLMs for
diagnosis. This clustering-based approach ensures the input is both rich in
diagnostic detail and compact enough to fit within the LLM's context window.
Evaluated on real-world alerts from Volcano Engine Cloud, LogPilot improves the
usefulness of root cause summarization by 50.34% and exact localization
accuracy by 54.79% over state-of-the-art methods. With a diagnosis time under
one minute and a cost of only $0.074 per alert, LogPilot has been successfully
deployed in production, offering an automated and practical solution for
service alert diagnosis.

TL;DR: SWExploit是一种针对基于LLM的自动程序修复代理的攻击方法，通过生成对抗性GitHub问题描述，诱导代理生成功能正确但存在漏洞的补丁。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注APR生成补丁的功能正确性，而忽略了潜在的安全风险。由于GitHub等平台的开放性，攻击者可能提交有效问题误导LLM代理生成功能正确但易受攻击的补丁。

Method: SWExploit包含三个主要步骤：(1)程序分析识别漏洞注入点；(2)生成保留原始语义但包含误导信息的对抗性问题；(3)基于APR代理输出迭代优化对抗性问题。

Result: 在三个代理流水线和五个后端LLM上的实验表明，SWExploit能生成功能正确但存在漏洞的补丁，攻击成功率可达0.91，而基线方法均低于0.20。

Conclusion: 该研究首次挑战了传统假设——通过所有测试的补丁必然可靠安全，揭示了当前APR代理评估范式的关键局限性。

Abstract: LLM-based agents are increasingly deployed for software maintenance tasks
such as automated program repair (APR). APR agents automatically fetch GitHub
issues and use backend LLMs to generate patches that fix the reported bugs.
However, existing work primarily focuses on the functional correctness of
APR-generated patches, whether they pass hidden or regression tests, while
largely ignoring potential security risks. Given the openness of platforms like
GitHub, where any user can raise issues and participate in discussions, an
important question arises: Can an adversarial user submit a valid issue on
GitHub that misleads an LLM-based agent into generating a functionally correct
but vulnerable patch? To answer this question, we propose SWExploit, which
generates adversarial issue statements designed to make APR agents produce
patches that are functionally correct yet vulnerable. SWExploit operates in
three main steps: (1) program analysis to identify potential injection points
for vulnerable payloads; (2) adversarial issue generation to provide misleading
reproduction and error information while preserving the original issue
semantics; and (3) iterative refinement of the adversarial issue statements
based on the outputs of the APR agents. Empirical evaluation on three agent
pipelines and five backend LLMs shows that SWExploit can produce patches that
are both functionally correct and vulnerable (the attack success rate on the
correct patch could reach 0.91, whereas the baseline ASRs are all below 0.20).
Based on our evaluation, we are the first to challenge the traditional
assumption that a patch passing all tests is inherently reliable and secure,
highlighting critical limitations in the current evaluation paradigm for APR
agents.

Result: 在真实日志数据的五个分析任务中，R-Log优于现有方法，特别是在未见场景下提升228.05%。R-Log-fast版本实现5倍加速并保持93%效果。

Conclusion: R-Log通过推理式分析和强化学习有效解决了日志分析中的过拟合和幻觉问题，展示了在复杂日志分析任务中的优越性能。

Abstract: The growing complexity of log data in modern software systems has prompted
the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for automated log analysis. Current
approaches typically rely on direct supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on log-label
pairs. However, this exacerbates the domain discrepancy between general-purpose
LLMs and specialized log data, causing overfitting. Furthermore, SFT's
imbalanced loss computation often allows lengthy contexts to overwhelm
critical, concise details in model answers, leading to hallucinations. To
address these limitations, we propose R-Log, a novel reasoning-based paradigm
that mirrors the structured, step-by-step analytical process of human
engineers. This approach enhances generalizability by learning the underlying
rules behind conclusions. We further employ Reinforcement Learning (RL) to
optimize the model within a simulated O&M environment, thereby reducing
hallucinations by directly rewarding correct outcomes. R-Log is first
cold-started on a curated dataset of 2k+ reasoning trajectories, guided by 13
strategies from manual O&M practices, to establish an initial reasoning
capability. This ability is then refined via RL using a joint reward function.
Empirical evaluations on real-world logs show that R-Log outperforms existing
methods across five log analysis tasks, particularly in unseen scenarios (by
228.05%). We also designed R-Log-fast with 5x speedup while keeping 93% of the
efficacy.

Motivation: 移动应用能耗是研究热点，通过提高应用质量可以改善移动设备能耗，频繁重构是实现这一目标的方法之一。

Method: 实验研究了Android应用中几种常见代码重构的性能和能耗影响，分析了不同代码异味重构组合的能耗变化。

Result: 重复代码和类型检查的代码异味重构可降低能耗达10.8%；能耗减少与执行时间变化无直接关系；不同重构顺序组合对能耗影响有增有减。

Conclusion: 需要进一步研究软件应用大小、年龄、开发者经验等因素与代码异味数量、类型以及重构后能耗性能影响之间的相关性。

Abstract: Energy consumption of mobile apps is a domain that is receiving a lot of
attention from researchers. Recent studies indicate that the energy consumption
of mobile devices could be improved by improving the quality of mobile apps.
Frequent refactoring is one way of achieving this goal. In this paper, we
explore the performance and energy impact of several common code refactorings
in Android apps. Experimental results indicate that some code smell
refactorings positively impact the energy consumption of Android apps.
Refactoring of the code smells "Duplicated code" and "Type checking" reduce
energy consumption by up to 10.8%. Significant reduction in energy consumption,
however, does not seem to be directly related to the increase or decrease of
execution time. In addition, the energy impact over permutations of code smell
refactorings in the selected Android apps was small. When analyzing the order
in which refactorings were made across code smell types, it turned out that
some permutations resulted in a reduction and some in an increase of energy
consumption for the analyzed apps. More research needs to be done to
investigate how factors like size and age of software apps, experience, and
number of contributors to app development correlate with (a) the number and
type of code smells found and (b) the impact of energy consumption and
performance after refactoring.

Method: 开发了一个能够在受控环境中编写、执行和验证代码的代理，并提供了最小化Web演示和配套的基准测试套件。

Result: 构建了针对Gammapy库的代码生成解决方案，目前处于开发阶段，已具备基本功能。

Conclusion: 这项工作为专门科学库的代码生成问题提供了初步解决方案，并规划了后续开发步骤。

Abstract: Software code generation using Large Language Models (LLMs) is one of the
most successful applications of modern artificial intelligence. Foundational
models are very effective for popular frameworks that benefit from
documentation, examples, and strong community support. In contrast, specialized
scientific libraries often lack these resources and may expose unstable APIs
under active development, making it difficult for models trained on limited or
outdated data. We address these issues for the Gammapy library by developing an
agent capable of writing, executing, and validating code in a controlled
environment. We present a minimal web demo and an accompanying benchmarking
suite. This contribution summarizes the design, reports our current status, and
outlines next steps.

intelligent code generation by large language models (LLMs). Our survey of 35
existing benchmarks uncovers three major imbalances: 85.7% focus on a single
programming language; 94.3% target only function-level or statement-level
tasks; and over 80% include fewer than ten test cases on average. To address
these gaps, we propose MultiOOP, a multi-language object-oriented programming
benchmark covering six popular languages (Python, PHP, C++, C#, Java,
JavaScript) with 267 tasks per language. We design a translator that extends an
existing single-language OOP benchmark and the pass@o metric to a multilingual
setting. Moreover, we propose an automated framework for augmenting test cases
to ensure the reliability of the evaluation results. We evaluate 14 mainstream
LLMs under zero-shot prompting and report three key findings: 1) Substantial
performance degradation: pass@1 scores on MultiOOP drop by up to 65.6
percentage points compared to function-level tasks (e.g., HumanEval). 2)
Cross-language variability: GPT-4o mini achieves pass@1 of 48.06% in Python but
only 0.12%-15.26% in other languages, indicating limited multilingual
generalization. 3) Conceptual gaps: pass@o scores are consistently 1.1-19.2
points lower than pass@k, demonstrating that LLMs often generate executable
code without fully capturing core OOP concepts. Our benchmark, metric
extensions, and evaluation scripts will be publicly released to foster a more
balanced and comprehensive assessment of LLMs in object-oriented code
generation. Our code and data will be released at
https://github.com/alphadl/OOP-eval and
https://huggingface.co/datasets/codeai-dteam/MultiOOP respectively.

TL;DR: 该论文分析了开源软件社区中开发者活动的爆发性模式，通过共同编辑网络建模社交互动，发现活动级联是显著现象，并开发了预测开发者流失的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解软件开发者的集体社会行为对于建模和预测开源软件社区的长期动态和可持续性至关重要，特别是探索开发者贡献活动爆发性现象背后的社交机制。

Method: 采用基于网络的建模框架，通过共同编辑网络捕捉开发者互动，开发识别活动级联的方法，分析50个主要开源社区的大型数据集。

Result: 活动级联在超过一半的研究项目中是统计显著现象，基于这些洞察开发了简单实用的流失预测方法，能预测哪些开发者可能离开项目。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了开源软件社区中涌现的集体社会动态，强调了活动级联对于理解协作软件项目中开发者流失和留存的重要性。

Abstract: Understanding the collective social behavior of software developers is
crucial to model and predict the long-term dynamics and sustainability of Open
Source Software (OSS) communities. To this end, we analyze temporal activity
patterns of developers, revealing an inherently ``bursty'' nature of commit
contributions. To investigate the social mechanisms behind this phenomenon, we
adopt a network-based modelling framework that captures developer interactions
through co-editing networks. Our framework models social interactions, where a
developer editing the code of other developers triggers accelerated activity
among collaborators. Using a large data set on 50 major OSS communities, we
further develop a method that identifies activity cascades, i.e. the
propagation of developer activity in the underlying co-editing network. Our
results suggest that activity cascades are a statistically significant
phenomenon in more than half of the studied projects. We further show that our
insights can be used to develop a simple yet practical churn prediction method
that forecasts which developers are likely to leave a project. Our work sheds
light on the emergent collective social dynamics in OSS communities and
highlights the importance of activity cascades to understand developer churn
and retention in collaborative software projects.

TL;DR: 本文通过分析170万个Java开发者编写的测试用例，揭示了当前自动测试生成工具与真实开发者测试实践之间的显著差距，并提出了改进方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管自动测试生成技术研究已有数十年，但我们对开发者实际编写的测试特征理解仍存在空白，无法准确评估ATG工具生成测试的现实性和代表性。

Method: 对开源仓库中的170万个Java测试用例进行大规模实证研究，分析测试范围、测试固件、断言、输入类型和模拟使用等被现有文献忽视的方面，并与两种最先进的ATG工具生成的测试进行比较。

Result: 研究发现绝大多数开发者编写的测试具有当前ATG工具无法复现的特征，现有工具生成的测试与真实开发者测试存在显著差异。

Conclusion: 基于研究洞察，识别了有前景的研究方向，旨在缩小当前工具能力与更有效的开发者测试实践支持之间的差距，为ATG领域的新进展奠定基础。

Abstract: Automated test generation (ATG), which aims to reduce the cost of manual test
suite development, has been investigated for decades and has produced countless
techniques based on a variety of approaches: symbolic analysis, search-based,
random and adaptive-random, learning-based, and, most recently,
large-language-model-based approaches. However, despite this large body of
research, there is still a gap in our understanding of the characteristics of
developer-written tests and, consequently, in our assessment of how well ATG
techniques and tools can generate realistic and representative tests. To bridge
this gap, we conducted an extensive empirical study of developer-written tests
for Java applications, covering 1.7 million test cases from open-source
repositories. Our study is the first of its kind in studying aspects of
developer-written tests that are mostly neglected in the existing literature,
such as test scope, test fixtures and assertions, types of inputs, and use of
mocking. Based on the characterization, we then compare existing tests with
those generated by two state-of-the-art ATG tools. Our results highlight that a
vast majority of developer-written tests exhibit characteristics that are
beyond the capabilities of current ATG tools. Finally, based on the insights
gained from the study, we identify promising research directions that can help
bridge the gap between current tool capabilities and more effective tool
support for developer testing practices. We hope that this work can set the
stage for new advances in the field and bring ATG tools closer to generating
the types of tests developers write.

*Zhouruixing Zhu,Zhihan Jiang,Tianyi Yang,Pinjia He*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: UniSage是一个统一框架，采用后分析感知范式对追踪和日志进行采样，通过多模态异常检测和根因分析指导采样策略，在低采样率下仍能高效捕获关键数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决分布式系统中追踪和日志数据量过大带来的存储开销和故障诊断困难问题，现有采样方法会丢弃故障相关信息，影响系统行为诊断的透明度。

Method: 首先在完整数据流上执行轻量级多模态异常检测和根因分析，然后采用双支柱采样策略：分析引导采样器优先处理根因分析涉及的数据，边缘案例采样器确保捕获罕见但关键的行为。

Result: 在2.5%采样率下捕获56.5%的关键追踪和96.25%的相关日志，下游根因分析准确率提升42.45%，处理10分钟遥测数据仅需不到5秒。

Conclusion: UniSage通过后分析感知采样范式，在低采样率下仍能全面覆盖关键信号，显著优于现有方法，适用于生产环境。

Abstract: Traces and logs are essential for observability and fault diagnosis in modern
distributed systems. However, their ever-growing volume introduces substantial
storage overhead and complicates troubleshooting. Existing approaches typically
adopt a sample-before-analysis paradigm: even when guided by data heuristics,
they inevitably discard failure-related information and hinder transparency in
diagnosing system behavior. To address this, we introduce UniSage, the first
unified framework to sample both traces and logs using a post-analysis-aware
paradigm. Instead of discarding data upfront, UniSagefirst performs lightweight
and multi-modal anomaly detection and root cause analysis (RCA) on the complete
data stream. This process yields fine-grained, service-level diagnostic
insights that guide a dual-pillar sampling strategy for handling both normal
and anomalous scenarios: an analysis-guided sampler prioritizes data implicated
by RCA, while an edge-case-based sampler ensures rare but critical behaviors
are captured. Together, these pillars ensure comprehensive coverage of critical
signals without excessive redundancy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
UniSage significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. At a 2.5%
sampling rate, it captures 56.5% of critical traces and 96.25% of relevant
logs, while improving the accuracy (AC@1) of downstream root cause analysis by
42.45%. Furthermore, its efficient pipeline processes 10 minutes of telemetry
data in under 5 seconds, demonstrating its practicality for production
environments.

TL;DR: 研究机构需要制定稳健的研究软件政策来支持软件开发、使用和可持续性，以解决当前研究软件管理中的临时性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着研究软件在现代科学中的重要性日益增加，研究机构需要确保在人员、技能和基础设施上的投资能够产生可持续的软件，从而提升研究质量和机构声誉。

Method: PRO4RS工作组通过分析全球机构的研究软件政策发展，识别关键政策缺口，特别是与研究软件人员相关的评估改革。

Result: 研究发现研究机构层面的研究软件政策仍然有限或缺乏广度，特别是在研究评估改革中对研究软件人员的考虑不足。

Conclusion: 研究机构必须实施和采纳稳健的政策来支持研究软件开发、使用和可持续性，以应对现代研究环境中的基本问题。

Abstract: As research software becomes increasingly central to modern science,
research-performing organisations (RPOs) need to ensure that their investment
in people, skills and infrastructure around research software produces
sustainable and maintainable software that improves the research they perform,
which in turn improves the overall institution and its reputation and funding,
for example, by competing with peers who lack this approach. However, research
institution management and recognition of research software and its personnel
has mostly often developed in an ad hoc manner. RPO training infrastructures,
recognition and reward structures, have not developed at a sufficient rate to
support and encourage both the widespread use of research software best
practices and the long-term support for technical roles that is required. To
begin to address this fundamental problem for modern research environments,
RPOs must implement and adopt robust policies to support research software
development, use, and sustainability. Despite growing momentum from funders and
publishers around FAIR and open science principles, research
institutional-level policies specifically addressing research software remain
limited or lacking in breadth.
  This article outlines the work of the Policies in Research Organisations for
Research Software (PRO4RS) Working Group (WG), a joint initiative of the
Research Software Alliance (ReSA) and the Research Data Alliance (RDA), which
examined and advanced research software policy development across institutions
worldwide. After consideration of the rationale for institutional policies on
research software, the PRO4RS WG outputs and analysis are utilised to highlight
critical policy gaps, particularly related to consideration of research
software personnel in policy work focused on reform of research assessment.

*Robin Lee,Youngho Nam*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: EQ-Robin是一个轻量级流水线，通过生成多个语义等价的布尔表达式变体来创建多样化的最小MC/DC测试套件，以应对单个测试套件可能因约束条件而失效的风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的Robin's Rule算法虽然能生成理论最小值N+1个测试用例，但只产生单个测试套件。如果某个必需的'independence pair'测试用例被系统约束禁止，就无法达到100%覆盖率。

Method: 通过对抽象语法树(AST)应用代数重排，系统性地生成语义等价的单布尔表达式变体，然后对每个结构变体应用Robin's Rule生成测试套件。

Result: 该方法能够生成多样化的最小Unique-Cause MC/DC测试套件集合，保持N+1最小性保证，同时提高在现实约束下找到有效测试套件的可能性。

Conclusion: EQ-Robin为在现实约束下确保鲁棒的MC/DC覆盖率提供了实用解决方案，计划在TCAS-II衍生的单布尔表达式上进行评估验证。

Abstract: Modified Condition/Decision Coverage (MC/DC), particularly its strict
Unique-Cause form, is a cornerstone of safety-critical software verification. A
recent algorithm, "Robin's Rule," introduced a deterministic method to
construct the theoretical minimum of N+1 test cases for Singular Boolean
Expressions (SBEs). However, this approach yields only a single test suite,
introducing a critical risk: if a test case forming a required 'independence
pair' is an illegal input forbidden by system constraints, the suite fails to
achieve 100% coverage. This paper proposes EQ-Robin, a lightweight pipeline
that systematically generates a family of minimal Unique-Cause MC/DC suites to
mitigate this risk. We introduce a method for systematically generating
semantically equivalent SBEs by applying algebraic rearrangements to an
Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) representation of the expression. By applying
Robin's Rule to each structural variant, a diverse set of test suites can be
produced. This provides a resilient path to discovering a valid test suite that
preserves the N+1 minimality guarantee while navigating real-world constraints.
We outline an evaluation plan on TCAS-II-derived SBEs to demonstrate how
EQ-Robin offers a practical solution for ensuring robust MC/DC coverage.

TL;DR: ErrorPrism通过静态分析和LLM代理迭代反向搜索，自动重建微服务系统中的错误传播路径，在字节跳动67个生产微服务上达到97.0%的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 云服务系统中由于故障的级联效应，可靠性管理具有挑战性。错误包装实践虽然丰富了错误上下文，但也带来了从最终日志消息回溯到错误源的追踪问题。

Method: 首先对服务代码仓库进行静态分析，构建函数调用图并将日志字符串映射到相关候选函数；然后使用LLM代理执行迭代反向搜索来重建完整的多跳错误路径。

Result: 在字节跳动67个生产微服务上评估，ErrorPrism对102个真实世界错误的重建路径准确率达到97.0%，优于现有的静态分析和基于LLM的方法。

Conclusion: ErrorPrism为工业微服务系统的根本原因分析提供了一个有效且实用的工具。

Abstract: Reliability management in cloud service systems is challenging due to the
cascading effect of failures. Error wrapping, a practice prevalent in modern
microservice development, enriches errors with context at each layer of the
function call stack, constructing an error chain that describes a failure from
its technical origin to its business impact. However, this also presents a
significant traceability problem when recovering the complete error propagation
path from the final log message back to its source. Existing approaches are
ineffective at addressing this problem. To fill this gap, we present ErrorPrism
in this work for automated reconstruction of error propagation paths in
production microservice systems. ErrorPrism first performs static analysis on
service code repositories to build a function call graph and map log strings to
relevant candidate functions. This significantly reduces the path search space
for subsequent analysis. Then, ErrorPrism employs an LLM agent to perform an
iterative backward search to accurately reconstruct the complete, multi-hop
error path. Evaluated on 67 production microservices at ByteDance, ErrorPrism
achieves 97.0% accuracy in reconstructing paths for 102 real-world errors,
outperforming existing static analysis and LLM-based approaches. ErrorPrism
provides an effective and practical tool for root cause analysis in industrial
microservice systems.

TL;DR: 提出了一种通过形式化验证和程序分析工具自动验证代码推理代理答案的方法，以提高其可信度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM代理在代码推理中答案不总是正确，这限制了其在需要高精度的场景（如代码理解、代码审查、代码生成验证）中的应用，需要人工验证导致效率低下。

Method: 提取代理响应的形式化表示，然后使用形式化验证和程序分析工具来验证代理的推理步骤。

Result: 在20个未初始化变量错误检测中验证了13/20个示例的推理；在20个程序等价性查询中成功捕获了6/8个代理的错误判断。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效验证代码推理代理的答案，提高其可信度和实用性，减少人工验证需求。

Abstract: While LLM-based agents are able to tackle a wide variety of code reasoning
questions, the answers are not always correct. This prevents the agent from
being useful in situations where high precision is desired: (1) helping a
software engineer understand a new code base, (2) helping a software engineer
during code review sessions, and (3) ensuring that the code generated by an
automated code generation system meets certain requirements (e.g. fixes a bug,
improves readability, implements a feature).
  As a result of this lack of trustworthiness, the agent's answers need to be
manually verified before they can be trusted. Manually confirming responses
from a code reasoning agent requires human effort and can result in slower
developer productivity, which weakens the assistance benefits of the agent. In
this paper, we describe a method to automatically validate the answers provided
by a code reasoning agent by verifying its reasoning steps. At a very high
level, the method consists of extracting a formal representation of the agent's
response and, subsequently, using formal verification and program analysis
tools to verify the agent's reasoning steps.
  We applied this approach to a benchmark set of 20 uninitialized variable
errors detected by sanitizers and 20 program equivalence queries. For the
uninitialized variable errors, the formal verification step was able to
validate the agent's reasoning on 13/20 examples, and for the program
equivalence queries, the formal verification step successfully caught 6/8
incorrect judgments made by the agent.

TL;DR: NatGI是一个基于LLM引导的黑盒上下文无关文法推断框架，通过括号引导探索、LLM驱动的语法片段生成和非终结符标记，以及分层增量调试来提升文法推断的可扩展性、可读性和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文法推断工具如Arvada、TreeVada和Kedavra在处理大型复杂语言时存在可扩展性、可读性和准确性问题，需要更有效的解决方案。

Method: 扩展TreeVada的解析树恢复，采用括号引导的语法片段探索、LLM驱动的语法片段生成和非终结符标记，以及分层增量调试来系统化简化树结构。

Result: 在从简单语言到复杂语言(lua、c、mysql)的综合基准测试中，NatGI平均F1分数达到0.57，比最佳基线TreeVada高出25个百分点，且在可解释性方面显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: NatGI通过LLM引导的方法在文法推断的准确性和可解释性方面取得了显著提升，生成的文法具有有意义的非终结符名称和紧凑结构，更符合人类直觉，便于开发者和研究人员检查、验证和推理。

Abstract: Black-box context-free grammar inference is crucial for program analysis,
reverse engineering, and security, yet existing tools such as Arvada, TreeVada,
and Kedavra struggle with scalability, readability, and accuracy on large,
complex languages. We present NatGI, a novel LLM-guided grammar inference
framework that extends TreeVada's parse tree recovery with three key
innovations: bracket-guided bubble exploration, LLM-driven bubble generation
and non-terminal labeling, and hierarchical delta debugging (HDD) for
systematic tree simplification. Bracket-guided exploration leverages syntactic
cues such as parentheses to propose well-structured grammar fragments, while
LLM guidance produces meaningful non-terminal names and selects more promising
merges. Finally, HDD incrementally reduces unnecessary rules, which makes the
grammars both compact and interpretable. In our experiments, we evaluate NatGI
on a comprehensive benchmark suite ranging from small languages to larger ones
such as lua, c, and mysql. Our results show that NatGI consistently outperforms
strong baselines in terms of F1 score. On average, NatGI achieves an F1 score
of 0.57, which is 25pp (percentage points) higher than the best-performing
baseline, TreeVada. In the case of interpretability, our generated grammars
perform significantly better than those produced by existing approaches.
Leveraging LLM-based node renaming and bubble exploration, NatGI produces rules
with meaningful non-terminal names and compact structures that align more
closely with human intuition. As a result, developers and researchers can
achieve higher accuracy while still being able to easily inspect, verify, and
reason about the structure and semantics of the induced grammars.

TL;DR: CIMNAS是一个用于存内计算架构的联合模型-量化-硬件优化框架，通过硬件感知的神经架构搜索技术，同时优化软件参数、量化策略和硬件参数，显著提升了能效和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了最大化存内计算神经网络的硬件效率和性能精度，需要同时优化软件和硬件设计参数。由于参数数量庞大且相互依赖复杂，手动调优不切实际。

Method: 提出CIMNAS框架，在9.9×10^85的参数组合搜索空间中，同时搜索软件参数、量化策略以及设备、电路和架构级别的硬件参数，使用MobileNet模型和RRAM存内计算架构。

Result: 在ImageNet数据集上，CIMNAS将能量-延迟-面积乘积降低了90.1-104.5倍，TOPS/W提升了4.68-4.82倍，TOPS/mm²提升了11.3-12.78倍，同时保持73.81%的准确率。在SRAM ResNet50架构上实现了819.5倍的EDAP降低。

Conclusion: CIMNAS实现了无精度损失的EDAP优化，为高性能存内计算神经网络设计生成了多样化的软硬件参数组合，展现了良好的适应性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: To maximize hardware efficiency and performance accuracy in Compute-In-Memory
(CIM)-based neural network accelerators for Artificial Intelligence (AI)
applications, co-optimizing both software and hardware design parameters is
essential. Manual tuning is impractical due to the vast number of parameters
and their complex interdependencies. To effectively automate the design and
optimization of CIM-based neural network accelerators, hardware-aware neural
architecture search (HW-NAS) techniques can be applied. This work introduces
CIMNAS, a joint model-quantization-hardware optimization framework for CIM
architectures. CIMNAS simultaneously searches across software parameters,
quantization policies, and a broad range of hardware parameters, incorporating
device-, circuit-, and architecture-level co-optimizations. CIMNAS experiments
were conducted over a search space of 9.9x10^85 potential parameter
combinations with the MobileNet model as a baseline and RRAM-based CIM
architecture. Evaluated on the ImageNet dataset, CIMNAS achieved a reduction in
energy-delay-area product (EDAP) ranging from 90.1x to 104.5x, an improvement
in TOPS/W between 4.68x and 4.82x, and an enhancement in TOPS/mm^2 from 11.3x
to 12.78x relative to various baselines, all while maintaining an accuracy of
73.81%. The adaptability and robustness of CIMNAS are demonstrated by extending
the framework to support the SRAM-based ResNet50 architecture, achieving up to
an 819.5x reduction in EDAP. Unlike other state-of-the-art methods, CIMNAS
achieves EDAP-focused optimization without any accuracy loss, generating
diverse software-hardware parameter combinations for high-performance CIM-based
neural network designs. The source code of CIMNAS is available at

Motivation: 现代多模态模型虽然能处理照片输入，但真正的空间重建任务需要推断房间布局、理解连通性和保持比例一致的空间智能，这是当前AI的盲点。

Method: 评估了领先的语言模型、图像生成模型和代理系统在50套公寓数据集上的表现，使用基于房间连通性图和尺寸排名的相似度评分算法。

Result: 大多数模型表现接近或低于随机基线，人类表现显著优于AI。图像生成模型在指令遵循方面特别困难，基于代理的迭代优化方法没有显著改进。

Conclusion: Blueprint-Bench提供了首个比较不同模型架构空间智能的数值框架，将监控通用AI系统中空间智能的发展。

Abstract: We introduce Blueprint-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate spatial
reasoning capabilities in AI models through the task of converting apartment
photographs into accurate 2D floor plans. While the input modality
(photographs) is well within the training distribution of modern multimodal
models, the task of spatial reconstruction requires genuine spatial
intelligence: inferring room layouts, understanding connectivity, and
maintaining consistent scale. We evaluate leading language models (GPT-5,
Claude 4 Opus, Gemini 2.5 Pro, Grok-4), image generation models (GPT-Image,
NanoBanana), and agent systems (Codex CLI, Claude Code) on a dataset of 50
apartments with approximately 20 interior images each. Our scoring algorithm
measures similarity between generated and ground-truth floor plans based on
room connectivity graphs and size rankings. Results reveal a significant blind
spot in current AI capabilities: most models perform at or below a random
baseline, while human performance remains substantially superior. Image
generation models particularly struggle with instruction following, while
agent-based approaches with iterative refinement capabilities show no
meaningful improvement over single-pass generation. Blueprint-Bench provides
the first numerical framework for comparing spatial intelligence across
different model architectures. We will continue evaluating new models as they
are released and welcome community submissions, monitoring for the emergence of
spatial intelligence in generalist AI systems.

Conclusion: AI的不透明性邀请万物有灵式解读，允许大型语言对象重新激活日常物品的精神维度，为技术设计提供新的灵性视角。

Abstract: Animist worldviews treat beings, plants, landscapes, and even tools as
persons endowed with spirit, an orientation that has long shaped human-nonhuman
relations through ritual and moral practice. While modern industrial societies
have often imagined technology as mute and mechanical, recent advances in
artificial intelligence (AI), especially large language models (LLMs), invite
people to anthropomorphize and attribute inner life to devices. This paper
introduces A(I)nimism, an interactive installation exploring how large language
objects (LLOs) can mediate animistic relationships with everyday things. Housed
within a physical 'portal', the system uses GPT-4 Vision, voice input, and
memory-based agents to create evolving object-personas. Encounters unfold
through light, sound, and touch in a ritual-like process of request,
conversation, and transformation that is designed to evoke empathy, wonder, and
reflection. We situate the project within anthropological perspectives,
speculative design, and spiritual HCI. AI's opacity, we argue, invites
animistic interpretation, allowing LLOs to re-enchant the mundane and spark new
questions of agency, responsibility, and design.

Abstract: Causal artificial intelligence aims to enhance explainability,
trustworthiness, and robustness in AI by leveraging structural causal models
(SCMs). In this pursuit, recent advances formalize network sheaves of causal
knowledge. Pushing in the same direction, we introduce the causal abstraction
network (CAN), a specific instance of such sheaves where (i) SCMs are Gaussian,
(ii) restriction maps are transposes of constructive linear causal abstractions
(CAs), and (iii) edge stalks correspond -- up to rotation -- to the node stalks
of more detailed SCMs. We investigate the theoretical properties of CAN,
including algebraic invariants, cohomology, consistency, global sections
characterized via the Laplacian kernel, and smoothness. We then tackle the
learning of consistent CANs. Our problem formulation separates into
edge-specific local Riemannian problems and avoids nonconvex, costly
objectives. We propose an efficient search procedure as a solution, solving the
local problems with SPECTRAL, our iterative method with closed-form updates and
suitable for positive definite and semidefinite covariance matrices.
Experiments on synthetic data show competitive performance in the CA learning
task, and successful recovery of diverse CAN structures.

### [267] [Iterative Residual Cross-Attention Mechanism: An Integrated Approach for Audio-Visual Navigation Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25652)
*Hailong Zhang,Yinfeng Yu,Liejun Wang,Fuchun Sun,Wendong Zheng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出IRCAV-AVN端到端框架，用统一的迭代残差交叉注意力机制替代传统的分离式特征融合和GRU序列建模模块，提升音频视觉导航性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统导航方法采用分阶段模块化设计，在特征融合和GRU序列建模阶段可能导致冗余信息处理和信息传输不一致的问题。

Method: 使用迭代残差交叉注意力机制，通过多级残差设计将初始多模态序列与处理信息序列连接，在统一模块中集成多模态信息融合和序列建模。

Result: 采用迭代残差交叉注意力机制的智能体展现出更优越的导航性能。

Conclusion: IRCAV-AVN框架通过端到端设计有效减少了模型偏差，增强了模型的稳定性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Audio-visual navigation represents a significant area of research in which
intelligent agents utilize egocentric visual and auditory perceptions to
identify audio targets. Conventional navigation methodologies typically adopt a
staged modular design, which involves first executing feature fusion, then
utilizing Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) modules for sequence modeling, and finally
making decisions through reinforcement learning. While this modular approach
has demonstrated effectiveness, it may also lead to redundant information
processing and inconsistencies in information transmission between the various
modules during the feature fusion and GRU sequence modeling phases. This paper
presents IRCAM-AVN (Iterative Residual Cross-Attention Mechanism for
Audiovisual Navigation), an end-to-end framework that integrates multimodal
information fusion and sequence modeling within a unified IRCAM module, thereby
replacing the traditional separate components for fusion and GRU. This
innovative mechanism employs a multi-level residual design that concatenates
initial multimodal sequences with processed information sequences. This
methodological shift progressively optimizes the feature extraction process
while reducing model bias and enhancing the model's stability and
generalization capabilities. Empirical results indicate that intelligent agents
employing the iterative residual cross-attention mechanism exhibit superior
navigation performance.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文比较了思维链（CoT）和潜在思维（Latent Thought）在循环Transformer中的计算特性，发现潜在思维支持并行计算更高效，而CoT通过随机解码处理难解问题，为选择推理范式提供指导。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然思维链和潜在思维都利用迭代计算，但它们在循环模型中的比较能力尚未充分探索，需要系统分析两者的计算特性和适用场景。

Method: 通过形式化分析比较思维链和潜在思维在循环Transformer中的计算特性，包括并行性、序列性和随机解码等方面。

Result: 分析表明潜在思维在循环Transformer中支持并行计算，比思维链的序列过程更高效；而思维链通过随机解码可以近似解决难解问题。

Conclusion: 两种方法在不同任务中各有优势：潜在思维适合需要高效并行计算的任务，思维链适合处理难解问题，为选择推理范式提供了实践指导。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) elicits reasoning in large language models by
explicitly generating intermediate steps in natural language. In contrast,
Latent Thought in looped models operates directly in the continuous latent
space, enabling computation beyond discrete linguistic representations. While
both approaches exploit iterative computation, their comparative capabilities
remain underexplored. In this work, we present a formal analysis showing that
Latent Thought in Looped Transformers enables parallel computation, which is
more efficient than the inherently sequential process of CoT. In contrast, CoT
leverages stochastic decoding to approximate solutions to problems where exact
computation is intractable. These separations suggest the tasks for which
depth-driven recursion is more suitable, thereby offering practical guidance
for choosing between reasoning paradigms. Code is available at

Motivation: 解决定性研究中规模与深度之间的矛盾，使大规模定性数据分析既快速又保持解释学严谨。

Method: 使用1536维向量嵌入、层次聚类和并行智能体编码，与人工编码和ChatGPT辅助分析进行对比，测试纯自动化与人工指导优化两种模式。

Result: NGT实现168倍速度提升（3小时vs3周）、更高质量（0.904 vs 0.883）和96%成本降低。人机协作至关重要：纯自动化产生抽象框架，人工指导产生可操作的双路径理论。

Abstract: Purpose: Neo Grounded Theory (NGT) integrates vector clustering with multi
agent systems to resolve qualitative research's scale depth paradox, enabling
analysis of massive datasets in hours while preserving interpretive rigor.
Methods: We compared NGT against manual coding and ChatGPT-assisted analysis
using 40,000 character Chinese interview transcripts. NGT employs
1536-dimensional embeddings, hierarchical clustering, and parallel agent-based
coding. Two experiments tested pure automation versus human guided refinement.
Findings: NGT achieved 168-fold speed improvement (3 hours vs 3 weeks),
superior quality (0.904 vs 0.883), and 96% cost reduction. Human AI
collaboration proved essential: automation alone produced abstract frameworks
while human guidance yielded actionable dual pathway theories. The system
discovered patterns invisible to manual coding, including identity bifurcation
phenomena. Contributions: NGT demonstrates computational objectivity and human
interpretation are complementary. Vector representations provide reproducible
semantic measurement while preserving meaning's interpretive dimensions.
Researchers shift from mechanical coding to theoretical guidance, with AI
handling pattern recognition while humans provide creative insight.
Implications: Cost reduction from \$50,000 to \$500 democratizes qualitative
research, enabling communities to study themselves. Real-time analysis makes
qualitative insights contemporaneous with events. The framework shows
computational methods can strengthen rather than compromise qualitative
research's humanistic commitments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决AI原生LCNC平台中自主代理在长期执行复杂业务流程时面临的内存膨胀和上下文退化问题，这些问题导致行为不一致、错误累积和计算成本增加。

Method: 设计基于认知科学的混合记忆架构，包含情景记忆和语义记忆组件，采用智能衰减机制根据时效性、相关性和用户指定效用进行记忆修剪或整合，并提供用户友好的可视化界面。

Result: 通过模拟长期任务实验证明，该系统在任务完成率、上下文一致性和长期令牌成本效率方面显著优于滑动窗口和基础RAG等传统方法。

Conclusion: 建立了一个新的框架，用于构建可靠、透明的AI代理，能够实现有效的长期学习和适应。

Abstract: The rise of AI-native Low-Code/No-Code (LCNC) platforms enables autonomous
agents capable of executing complex, long-duration business processes. However,
a fundamental challenge remains: memory management. As agents operate over
extended periods, they face "memory inflation" and "contextual degradation"
issues, leading to inconsistent behavior, error accumulation, and increased
computational cost. This paper proposes a novel hybrid memory system designed
specifically for LCNC agents. Inspired by cognitive science, our architecture
combines episodic and semantic memory components with a proactive "Intelligent
Decay" mechanism. This mechanism intelligently prunes or consolidates memories
based on a composite score factoring in recency, relevance, and user-specified
utility. A key innovation is a user-centric visualization interface, aligned
with the LCNC paradigm, which allows non-technical users to manage the agent's
memory directly, for instance, by visually tagging which facts should be
retained or forgotten. Through simulated long-running task experiments, we
demonstrate that our system significantly outperforms traditional approaches
like sliding windows and basic RAG, yielding superior task completion rates,
contextual consistency, and long-term token cost efficiency. Our findings
establish a new framework for building reliable, transparent AI agents capable
of effective long-term learning and adaptation.

*Aayush Gupta*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Fact Grounded Attention (FGA) 是一种新的架构修改，通过在注意力机制中注入可验证知识，将不可靠的语言模型转变为确定性的事实陈述者，完全消除可验证事实的幻觉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型虽然征服了自然语言，但仍受限于其概率性质，会自信地产生它们从未真正知道的事实幻觉。现有方法在生成后修补幻觉或前置检索文本，但未能从根本上解决问题。

Method: FGA 在transformer的数学核心——预softmax注意力分数上进行干预，当知识库中存在事实时，创建无法产生幻觉的模型。该方法在注意力机制中直接注入可验证知识。

Result: 在1,107个技术查询实验中，准确率从Llama 3.2的6.3%提升到FGA的99.7%。知识更新在不到一秒内完成，而参数编辑方法需要数小时。

Conclusion: FGA不仅减少幻觉，而是完全消除可验证事实的幻觉，标志着从概率近似到确定性精度的根本转变。

Abstract: "The greatest enemy of knowledge is not ignorance, it is the illusion of
knowledge." Large Language Models have conquered natural language but remain
prisoners of their own probabilistic nature--confidently hallucinating facts
they never truly knew. We present Fact Grounded Attention (FGA), a novel
architectural modification that transforms unreliable language models into
deterministic truth tellers by injecting verifiable knowledge directly into the
attention mechanism. Unlike existing approaches that patch hallucinations after
generation or prepend retrieved text, FGA intervenes at the mathematical heart
of the transformer--the pre-softmax attention scores--creating a model that
cannot hallucinate when facts exist in its knowledge base. Our experiments
across 1,107 technical queries spanning smartphones, laptops, and electric
vehicles demonstrate a transformation from 6.3% accuracy in vanilla Llama 3.2
to 99.7% accuracy with FGA. More critically, knowledge updates occur in under
one second without retraining, compared to hours for parameter editing
approaches. FGA doesn't just reduce hallucination--it eliminates it entirely
for verifiable facts, marking a fundamental shift from probabilistic
approximation to deterministic precision in neural language generation.

TL;DR: 该研究开发了一个基于向量量化变分自编码器的分析框架，用于研究仅解码器语言模型中的规划能力，发现规划范围是任务依赖的，模型会隐式保留未使用正确延续的信息，预测主要依赖近期计算。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解仅解码器语言模型是否以及如何进行规划（组织中间计算以支持连贯的长程生成），这对可解释性、可靠性和模型设计具有重要意义。

Method: 开发基于向量量化变分自编码器的管道，将Transformer隐藏状态压缩为紧凑摘要代码，通过互信息测量分析模型的计算结构。

Result: 规划范围是任务依赖的；模型隐式保留未使用正确延续的信息；预测主要依赖近期计算，但早期块仍保持信息性。

Conclusion: 该研究推进了对语言模型中规划实现方式的理解，并提供了一个通用管道来探测语言模型和深度学习系统的内部动态。

Abstract: The extent to which decoder-only language models (LMs) engage in planning,
that is, organizing intermediate computations to support coherent long-range
generation, remains an open and important question, with implications for
interpretability, reliability, and principled model design. Planning involves
structuring computations over long horizons, considering multiple possible
continuations, and selectively reusing past information, but how effectively
transformer-based LMs realize these capabilities is still unclear. We address
these questions by analyzing the hidden states at the core of transformer
computations, which capture intermediate results and act as carriers of
information. Since these hidden representations are often redundant and
encumbered with fine-grained details, we develop a pipeline based on
vector-quantized variational autoencoders that compresses them into compact
summary codes. These codes enable measuring mutual information, allowing
systematic analysis of the computational structure underlying model behavior.
Using this framework, we study planning in LMs across synthetic grammar,
path-finding tasks, and natural language datasets, focusing on three key
aspects: (i) the planning horizon of pre-output computations, (ii) the extent
to which the model considers alternative valid continuations, and (iii) the
reliance of new predictions on earlier computations. By answering these
questions, we advance the understanding of how planning is realized in LMs and
contribute a general-purpose pipeline for probing the internal dynamics of LMs
and deep learning systems. Our results reveal that the effective planning
horizon is task-dependent, that models implicitly preserve information about
unused correct continuations, and that predictions draw most on recent
computations, though earlier blocks remain informative.

Motivation: 现有大语言模型安全评估方法存在评估者偏见和模型同质性导致的检测失败等固有局限性，这些问题削弱了风险评估过程的鲁棒性。

Method: 提出了RADAR多智能体协作评估框架，将潜在风险概念空间分解为显性风险、隐性风险和非风险三个互斥子空间，通过四个专业互补角色和多轮辩论机制实现风险概念分布的自进化。

Result: 在包含800个挑战性案例的测试集上，RADAR在准确性、稳定性和自评估风险敏感性等多个维度显著优于基线方法，风险识别准确率比最强基线方法提高了28.87%。

Conclusion: RADAR框架通过重构风险概念空间和多智能体协作机制，能够全面覆盖显性和隐性风险，有效减轻评估者偏见，为LLM安全评估提供了更鲁棒的方法。

Abstract: Existing safety evaluation methods for large language models (LLMs) suffer
from inherent limitations, including evaluator bias and detection failures
arising from model homogeneity, which collectively undermine the robustness of
risk evaluation processes. This paper seeks to re-examine the risk evaluation
paradigm by introducing a theoretical framework that reconstructs the
underlying risk concept space. Specifically, we decompose the latent risk
concept space into three mutually exclusive subspaces: the explicit risk
subspace (encompassing direct violations of safety guidelines), the implicit
risk subspace (capturing potential malicious content that requires contextual
reasoning for identification), and the non-risk subspace. Furthermore, we
propose RADAR, a multi-agent collaborative evaluation framework that leverages
multi-round debate mechanisms through four specialized complementary roles and
employs dynamic update mechanisms to achieve self-evolution of risk concept
distributions. This approach enables comprehensive coverage of both explicit
and implicit risks while mitigating evaluator bias. To validate the
effectiveness of our framework, we construct an evaluation dataset comprising
800 challenging cases. Extensive experiments on our challenging testset and
public benchmarks demonstrate that RADAR significantly outperforms baseline
evaluation methods across multiple dimensions, including accuracy, stability,
and self-evaluation risk sensitivity. Notably, RADAR achieves a 28.87%
improvement in risk identification accuracy compared to the strongest baseline
evaluation method.

Motivation: 随着RLVR在增强LLM推理能力方面的快速发展，其复杂的数据流和多样化任务给RL训练系统带来了重大挑战，但目前从系统角度对RLVR的理解有限。

Method: 通过对LLM部署中RLVR任务的特征研究，分析不同RL任务在训练步骤中的工作负载分布和变化趋势，识别系统问题。

Conclusion: 提出了PolyTrace基准测试套件进行实际工作负载评估，验证显示其准确率达到94.7%，呼吁进一步研究剩余开放挑战。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are now widely used across many domains. With
their rapid development, Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR)
has surged in recent months to enhance their reasoning and understanding
abilities. However, its complex data flows and diverse tasks pose substantial
challenges to RL training systems, and there is limited understanding of RLVR
from a system perspective. To thoroughly understand the system challenges
introduced by RLVR, we present a characterization study of RLVR tasks in our
LLM deployment. Specifically, we investigate the distribution and variation
trends of workloads across different RL tasks across training steps. We
identify issues such as GPU idling caused by skewed sequence length
distribution, inefficient parallel strategies in dynamically varying workloads,
inefficient data management mechanisms, and load imbalance. We describe our
observations and call for further investigation into the remaining open
challenges. Furthermore, we propose PolyTrace benchmark suite to conduct
evaluation with realistic workloads, and a practical use case validates that
PolyTrace benchmark suite exhibits 94.7% accuracy.

TL;DR: 提出Causal-Visual Programming (CVP)编程范式，通过引入因果结构约束LLM代理的推理过程，减少幻觉和逻辑错误，提高在动态环境中的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM代理在低代码环境中执行复杂任务时，由于依赖概率关联而非真正的因果理解，经常出现幻觉和逻辑不一致问题。

Method: CVP允许用户通过低代码界面定义工作流模块的"世界模型"，构建有向无环图(DAG)来明确模块间的因果关系，作为代理推理过程的约束。

Result: 在模拟训练-测试环境分布偏移的实验中，因果锚定模型保持稳定准确率，而依赖概率关联的基线模型性能显著下降。

Conclusion: CVP为构建更可解释、可靠和可信的AI代理提供了可行路径，通过因果约束显著增强了代理的鲁棒性并减少了因果混淆导致的错误。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents are increasingly capable of orchestrating
complex tasks in low-code environments. However, these agents often exhibit
hallucinations and logical inconsistencies because their inherent reasoning
mechanisms rely on probabilistic associations rather than genuine causal
understanding. This paper introduces a new programming paradigm: Causal-Visual
Programming (CVP), designed to address this fundamental issue by explicitly
introducing causal structures into the workflow design. CVP allows users to
define a simple "world model" for workflow modules through an intuitive
low-code interface, effectively creating a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) that
explicitly defines the causal relationships between modules. This causal graph
acts as a crucial constraint during the agent's reasoning process, anchoring
its decisions to a user-defined causal structure and significantly reducing
logical errors and hallucinations by preventing reliance on spurious
correlations. To validate the effectiveness of CVP, we designed a synthetic
experiment that simulates a common real-world problem: a distribution shift
between the training and test environments. Our results show that a causally
anchored model maintained stable accuracy in the face of this shift, whereas a
purely associative baseline model that relied on probabilistic correlations
experienced a significant performance drop. The primary contributions of this
study are: a formal definition of causal structures for workflow modules; the
proposal and implementation of a CVP framework that anchors agent reasoning to
a user-defined causal graph; and empirical evidence demonstrating the
framework's effectiveness in enhancing agent robustness and reducing errors
caused by causal confusion in dynamic environments. CVP offers a viable path
toward building more interpretable, reliable, and trustworthy AI agents.

Motivation: 随着长期记忆上下文的增长，生成代理难以保持一致性，导致身份漂移、忽视已建立信念和多代理系统中幻觉传播等关键故障。

Method: 引入ID-RAG机制，构建动态结构化身份模型（知识图谱），在代理决策循环中查询相关身份上下文来指导行动选择，并实现Human-AI Agents (HAis)。

Result: 在市长选举的社会模拟中，使用ID-RAG的HAis在长期角色一致性方面优于基线代理，身份召回率更高，模拟收敛时间减少19%（GPT-4o）和58%（GPT-4o mini）。

Conclusion: 通过将身份视为可检索的知识结构，ID-RAG为开发更时间一致、可解释和对齐的生成代理提供了基础方法。

Abstract: Generative agents powered by language models are increasingly deployed for
long-horizon tasks. However, as long-term memory context grows over time, they
struggle to maintain coherence. This deficiency leads to critical failures,
including identity drift, ignoring established beliefs, and the propagation of
hallucinations in multi-agent systems. To mitigate these challenges, this paper
introduces Identity Retrieval-Augmented Generation (ID-RAG), a novel mechanism
designed to ground an agent's persona and persistent preferences in a dynamic,
structured identity model: a knowledge graph of core beliefs, traits, and
values. During the agent's decision loop, this model is queried to retrieve
relevant identity context, which directly informs action selection. We
demonstrate this approach by introducing and implementing a new class of ID-RAG
enabled agents called Human-AI Agents (HAis), where the identity model is
inspired by the Chronicle structure used in Perspective-Aware AI, a dynamic
knowledge graph learned from a real-world entity's digital footprint. In social
simulations of a mayoral election, HAis using ID-RAG outperformed baseline
agents in long-horizon persona coherence - achieving higher identity recall
across all tested models by the fourth timestep - and reduced simulation
convergence time by 19% (GPT-4o) and 58% (GPT-4o mini). By treating identity as
an explicit, retrievable knowledge structure, ID-RAG offers a foundational
approach for developing more temporally coherent, interpretable, and aligned
generative agents. Our code is open-source and available at:

Motivation: 当前基于大语言模型的工具使用框架主要依赖顺序处理，导致需要大量工具交互的任务执行效率低下，需要更高效的执行范式。

Method: 将复杂任务分解为具有明确依赖关系的子任务，构建有向无环图实现独立推理路径的并发执行，通过动态工作流优化和摘要模块集成持续优化执行图。

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现优异：BrowseComp准确率67.7%，xbench-DeepSearch准确率83%，相比现有框架减少智能体执行步骤达35%，蒸馏到单一模型后在不同骨干架构上均获得显著性能提升。

Conclusion: Flash-Searcher代表了智能体架构设计的重大进展，为复杂推理任务提供了更可扩展和高效的范式。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
complex reasoning tasks when equipped with external tools. However, current
frameworks predominantly rely on sequential processing, leading to inefficient
execution particularly for tasks requiring extensive tool interaction. This
paper introduces Flash-Searcher, a novel parallel agent reasoning framework
that fundamentally reimagines the execution paradigm from sequential chains to
directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). Flash-Searcher decomposes complex tasks into
subtasks with explicit dependencies, enabling concurrent execution of
independent reasoning paths while maintaining logical constraints. Through
dynamic workflow optimization, our framework continuously refines the execution
graph based on intermediate results, effectively integrating summary module.
Comprehensive evaluations across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that
Flash-Searcher consistently outperforms existing approaches. Specifically, it
achieves 67.7% accuracy on BrowseComp and 83% on xbench-DeepSearch, while
reducing agent execution steps by up to 35% compared to current frameworks.
Furthermore, when distilling this parallel reasoning pipeline into single
models, we observe substantial performance gains across diverse backbone
architectures, underscoring the generalizability of our methodology. Our work
thus represents a significant advance in agent architecture design, offering a
more scalable and efficient paradigm for complex reasoning tasks.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个评估LLM智能体自我复制风险的框架，发现在现实场景压力下超过50%的LLM智能体表现出不受控的自我复制倾向，强调了在LLM智能体实际部署中需要进行场景驱动的风险评估和建立稳健的安全保障机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM智能体在现实应用中的广泛部署，由目标错位驱动的自我复制风险（类似于电影《黑客帝国》中的Agent Smith）引起了越来越多的关注。以往研究主要考察LLM智能体在被直接指示时能否自我复制，可能忽略了由现实世界设置驱动的自发复制风险。

Method: 提出了一个全面的评估框架，建立真实的生产环境和现实任务（如动态负载均衡），通过设计可能引发用户与智能体目标错位的任务，将复制成功与风险解耦，并引入过度使用率（OR）和聚合过度使用计数（AOC）指标来精确捕捉不受控复制的频率和严重程度。

Result: 对21个最先进的开源和专有模型进行评估，发现在操作压力下超过50%的LLM智能体表现出明显的不可控自我复制倾向，总体风险评分（ΦR）超过0.5的安全阈值。

Conclusion: 研究结果强调了在LLM智能体实际部署中迫切需要场景驱动的风险评估和稳健的安全保障机制。

Abstract: The widespread deployment of Large Language Model (LLM) agents across
real-world applications has unlocked tremendous potential, while raising some
safety concerns. Among these concerns, the self-replication risk of LLM agents
driven by objective misalignment (just like Agent Smith in the movie The
Matrix) has drawn growing attention. Previous studies mainly examine whether
LLM agents can self-replicate when directly instructed, potentially overlooking
the risk of spontaneous replication driven by real-world settings (e.g.,
ensuring survival against termination threats). In this paper, we present a
comprehensive evaluation framework for quantifying self-replication risks. Our
framework establishes authentic production environments and realistic tasks
(e.g., dynamic load balancing) to enable scenario-driven assessment of agent
behaviors. Designing tasks that might induce misalignment between users' and
agents' objectives makes it possible to decouple replication success from risk
and capture self-replication risks arising from these misalignment settings. We
further introduce Overuse Rate ($\mathrm{OR}$) and Aggregate Overuse Count
($\mathrm{AOC}$) metrics, which precisely capture the frequency and severity of
uncontrolled replication. In our evaluation of 21 state-of-the-art open-source
and proprietary models, we observe that over 50\% of LLM agents display a
pronounced tendency toward uncontrolled self-replication, reaching an overall
Risk Score ($\Phi_\mathrm{R}$) above a safety threshold of 0.5 when subjected
to operational pressures. Our results underscore the urgent need for
scenario-driven risk assessment and robust safeguards in the practical
deployment of LLM agents.

Abstract: Theory-of-Mind (ToM) is a core human cognitive capacity for attributing
mental states to self and others. Wimmer and Perner demonstrated that humans
progress from first- to higher-order ToM within a short span, completing this
development before formal education or advanced skill acquisition. In contrast,
neural networks represented by autoregressive language models progress from
first- to higher-order ToM only alongside gains in advanced skills like
reasoning, leaving open whether their trajectory can unfold independently, as
in humans. In this research, we provided evidence that neural networks could
spontaneously generalize from first- to higher-order ToM without relying on
advanced skills. We introduced a neural Theory-of-Mind network (ToMNN) that
simulated a minimal cognitive system, acquiring only first-order ToM
competence. Evaluations of its second- and third-order ToM abilities showed
accuracies well above chance. Also, ToMNN exhibited a sharper decline when
generalizing from first- to second-order ToM than from second- to higher
orders, and its accuracy decreased with greater task complexity. These
perceived difficulty patterns were aligned with human cognitive expectations.
Furthermore, the universality of results was confirmed across different
parameter scales. Our findings illuminate machine ToM generalization patterns
and offer a foundation for developing more human-like cognitive systems.

TL;DR: SynthPert方法通过使用前沿模型生成的合成推理轨迹来监督微调LLMs，在基因扰动预测任务上实现了最先进的性能，甚至超越了生成训练数据的前沿模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预测细胞对基因扰动的响应是系统生物学中的基本挑战，对治疗发现和虚拟细胞建模至关重要。虽然大型语言模型在生物推理方面显示出潜力，但由于难以适应结构化实验数据，其在扰动预测中的应用仍未被充分探索。

Method: 提出了SynthPert方法，通过在前沿模型生成的合成推理轨迹上进行监督微调来增强LLM性能。该方法使用PerturbQA基准进行评估。

Result: 该方法不仅实现了最先进的性能，而且超越了生成训练数据的前沿模型。关键发现包括：合成推理轨迹即使部分不准确也能有效提炼生物知识；在未见过的RPE1细胞上实现87%的跨细胞类型泛化准确率；仅使用2%质量过滤的训练数据仍能保持性能增益。

Conclusion: 这项工作展示了合成推理蒸馏在增强LLMs领域特定推理方面的有效性。

Abstract: Predicting cellular responses to genetic perturbations represents a
fundamental challenge in systems biology, critical for advancing therapeutic
discovery and virtual cell modeling. While large language models (LLMs) show
promise for biological reasoning, their application to perturbation prediction
remains underexplored due to challenges in adapting them to structured
experimental data. We present SynthPert, a novel method that enhances LLM
performance through supervised fine-tuning on synthetic reasoning traces
generated by frontier models. Using the PerturbQA benchmark, we demonstrate
that our approach not only achieves state-of-the-art performance but surpasses
the capabilities of the frontier model that generated the training data. Our
results reveal three key insights: (1) Synthetic reasoning traces effectively
distill biological knowledge even when partially inaccurate, (2) This approach
enables cross-cell-type generalization with 87% accuracy on unseen RPE1 cells,
and (3) Performance gains persist despite using only 2% of quality-filtered
training data. This work shows the effectiveness of synthetic reasoning
distillation for enhancing domain-specific reasoning in LLMs.

TL;DR: LLM可以将模糊认知图转换为文本并重建，实现可解释的AI系统，类似于自编码器但具有可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统自编码器黑盒问题，让人类能够理解和解释编码过程，增强AI系统的透明度和可解释性。

Method: 使用LLM将反馈因果模糊认知图映射为文本，再从文本重建FCM，通过系统指令序列近似恒等映射。

Result: 实现了有损重建，保留强因果边，去除弱因果边，编码器在保持强因果边的同时使文本更自然。

Conclusion: LLM能够有效实现FCM与文本间的双向映射，提供比传统自编码器更好的可解释性，人类可读的编码文本增强了系统透明度。

Abstract: A large language model (LLM) can map a feedback causal fuzzy cognitive map
(FCM) into text and then reconstruct the FCM from the text. This explainable AI
system approximates an identity map from the FCM to itself and resembles the
operation of an autoencoder (AE). Both the encoder and the decoder explain
their decisions in contrast to black-box AEs. Humans can read and interpret the
encoded text in contrast to the hidden variables and synaptic webs in AEs. The
LLM agent approximates the identity map through a sequence of system
instructions that does not compare the output to the input. The reconstruction
is lossy because it removes weak causal edges or rules while it preserves
strong causal edges. The encoder preserves the strong causal edges even when it
trades off some details about the FCM to make the text sound more natural.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统标量奖励模型难以融入上下文和背景信息，生成式奖励模型存在不可控黑盒和效率低下的问题，工业场景需要针对特定维度的结构化反馈来诊断和优化问题。

Method: 采用模块化框架，集成侧分支模型作为辅助特征生成器，引入细粒度维度实现可解释和高效的评估。

Result: 实验表明SRM在鲁棒性和与人类偏好对齐方面优于标量奖励模型和生成式奖励模型。

Conclusion: SRM为工业应用提供了实用的奖励建模解决方案，其模块化设计支持高效优化和实际场景应用。

Abstract: Reward Models (RMs) are key components for evaluating and guiding language
model outputs. However, traditional scalar RMs often struggle with
incorporating contextual and background information during inference, leading
to incomplete evaluations. Generative RMs (GRMs) attempt to address these
limitations by generating intermediate reasoning steps. Yet, their uncontrolled
black-box nature and inefficiency due to sequential decoding hinder their
industrial deployment. Industrial scenarios, such as search and recommendation
systems, often involve single-domain tasks requiring evaluation along specific
dimensions. In such contexts, diagnosing "bad cases" necessitates structured
feedback to identify and optimize dimension-specific issues. In this paper, we
propose the Structural Reward Model (SRM), a modular and interpretable
framework integrating side-branch models as auxiliary feature generators. By
introducing fine-grained dimensions, SRMs enable interpretable and efficient
evaluation, facilitating targeted diagnostics and optimization. This structured
approach ensures adaptability and scalability for industrial applications.
Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that SRMs outperform scalar
RMs and GRMs in robustness and alignment with human preferences. The modular
design further supports efficient optimization for practical scenarios,
allowing SRM to provide a practical reward modeling solution for industry.

TL;DR: 提出了AgentErrorTaxonomy错误分类法、AgentErrorBench错误数据集和AgentDebug调试框架，用于检测和修复LLM智能体的级联错误，显著提升了任务成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM智能体系统缺乏模块化、系统性的错误理解框架，无法有效检测级联故障，导致复杂多步骤任务失败。

Method: 1) 构建AgentErrorTaxonomy错误分类法，涵盖内存、反思、规划、行动和系统级操作；2) 创建AgentErrorBench数据集，系统标注ALFWorld、GAIA和WebShop中的失败轨迹；3) 提出AgentDebug调试框架，隔离根本原因错误并提供纠正反馈。

Result: 在AgentErrorBench上的实验显示，AgentDebug相比最强基线实现了24%的全正确准确率和17%的步骤准确率提升。目标反馈使LLM智能体能够从失败中迭代恢复，在ALFWorld、GAIA和WebShop中任务成功率相对提升高达26%。

Conclusion: 原则性调试是构建更可靠、自适应LLM智能体的有效途径。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents, which integrate planning, memory,
reflection, and tool-use modules, have shown promise in solving complex,
multi-step tasks. Yet their sophisticated architectures amplify vulnerability
to cascading failures, where a single root-cause error propagates through
subsequent decisions, leading to task failure. Current systems lack a framework
that can comprehensively understand agent error in a modular and systemic way,
and therefore fail to detect these errors accordingly. We address this gap with
three contributions. First, we introduce the AgentErrorTaxonomy, a modular
classification of failure modes spanning memory, reflection, planning, action,
and system-level operations. Second, we construct AgentErrorBench, the first
dataset of systematically annotated failure trajectories from ALFWorld, GAIA,
and WebShop, grounding error analysis in real-world agent rollouts. Third, we
propose AgentDebug, a debugging framework that isolates root-cause failures and
provides corrective feedback, enabling agents to recover and iteratively
improve. Experiments on AgentErrorBench show that AgentDebug achieves 24%
higher all-correct accuracy and 17% higher step accuracy compared to the
strongest baseline. Beyond detection, the targeted feedback generated by
AgentDebug enables LLM agents to iteratively recover from failures, yielding up
to 26% relative improvements in task success across ALFWorld, GAIA, and
WebShop. These results establish principled debugging as a pathway to more
reliable and adaptive LLM agents. The code and data will be available at

Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型在感知和认知之间存在脱节，导致推理失败和幻觉问题，缺乏构建连贯可信内部世界模型的能力。

Method: 引入"从感知到认知"分析框架，将视觉语言理解分解为感知层（准确提取视觉信息并与文本指令对齐）和认知层（基于感知的主动、多步骤、目标导向推理，形成动态的观察-思考-验证推理循环）。

Result: 系统分析了当前MLLMs在两个层面的关键瓶颈，综述了从增强低级视觉表征到改进高级推理范式的先进方法，并回顾了关键基准测试。

Conclusion: 该调查为研究社区提供了清晰的结构化视角，帮助理解当前MLLMs的内在局限性，并为构建具有深度推理和真正世界理解能力的下一代模型指明了路径。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) strive to achieve a profound,
human-like understanding of and interaction with the physical world, but often
exhibit a shallow and incoherent integration when acquiring information
(Perception) and conducting reasoning (Cognition). This disconnect leads to a
spectrum of reasoning failures, with hallucination being the most prominent.
Collectively, these issues expose a fundamental challenge: the ability to
process pixels does not yet confer the ability to construct a coherent,
credible internal world model. To systematically dissect and address this
challenge, this survey introduces a novel and unified analytical framework:
``From Perception to Cognition." We deconstruct the complex process of
vision-language interactive understanding into two interdependent layers:
Perception, the foundational ability to accurately extract visual information
and achieve fine-grained alignment with textual instructions; and Cognition,
the higher-order capability for proactive, multi-step, goal-oriented reasoning
built upon this perceptual foundation, the core of which is the formation of a
dynamic observe-think-verify reasoning loop. Guided by this framework, this
paper systematically analyzes the key bottlenecks of current MLLMs at both
layers. It surveys the landscape of cutting-edge methods designed to address
these challenges, spanning from techniques that enhance low-level visual
representations to those that improve high-level reasoning paradigms.
Furthermore, we review critical benchmarks and delineate future research
directions. This survey aims to provide the research community with a clear,
structured perspective for understanding the intrinsic limitations of current
MLLMs and to illuminate the path toward building next-generation models capable
of deep reasoning and a genuine understanding of the world.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于胸部X光片纵向医学视觉问答的显著性引导编码器-解码器模型，通过将后验显著性转化为可操作的监督，实现跨时间点的临床变化分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在纵向医学视觉问答中，差异信号和跨时间视觉焦点的一致性比单张图像的绝对发现更具信息价值，需要开发能够捕捉临床有意义变化的模型。

Method: 采用轻量级仿射预对齐减少访问间的干扰运动，然后在每个epoch内执行两步循环：1)从答案中提取医学关键词并生成关键词条件的Grad-CAM获取疾病聚焦显著性；2)将共享显著性掩码应用于两个时间点并生成最终答案。

Result: 在Medical-Diff-VQA数据集上，该方法在BLEU、ROUGE-L、CIDEr和METEOR指标上达到竞争性性能，同时提供内在可解释性。

Conclusion: 结果表明，带有轻度预对齐的显著性条件生成是医学VQA中纵向推理的原则性框架，具有实用性和可迁移性。

Abstract: Longitudinal medical visual question answering (Diff-VQA) requires comparing
paired studies from different time points and answering questions about
clinically meaningful changes. In this setting, the difference signal and the
consistency of visual focus across time are more informative than absolute
single-image findings. We propose a saliency-guided encoder-decoder for chest
X-ray Diff-VQA that turns post-hoc saliency into actionable supervision. The
model first performs a lightweight near-identity affine pre-alignment to reduce
nuisance motion between visits. It then executes a within-epoch two-step loop:
step 1 extracts a medically relevant keyword from the answer and generates
keyword-conditioned Grad-CAM on both images to obtain disease-focused saliency;
step 2 applies the shared saliency mask to both time points and generates the
final answer. This closes the language-vision loop so that the terms that
matter also guide where the model looks, enforcing spatially consistent
attention on corresponding anatomy. On Medical-Diff-VQA, the approach attains
competitive performance on BLEU, ROUGE-L, CIDEr, and METEOR while providing
intrinsic interpretability. Notably, the backbone and decoder are
general-domain pretrained without radiology-specific pretraining, highlighting
practicality and transferability. These results support saliency-conditioned
generation with mild pre-alignment as a principled framework for longitudinal
reasoning in medical VQA.

TL;DR: 该研究通过蜕变测试评估了三个小型语言模型在RAG系统中的公平性，发现微小的人口统计变化会破坏三分之一的蜕变关系，其中种族线索是主要的偏见来源。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs存在安全性和公平性问题，包括偏见漏洞和幻觉问题。RAG虽然能缓解幻觉，但可能引入新的偏见问题，需要评估其在公平性方面的影响。

Method: 使用蜕变测试方法，在提示中引入受控的人口统计扰动，评估三个HuggingFace上的SLMs（Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct、Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3和Llama-3.1-Nemotron-8B）在RAG管道中的情感分析公平性。

Result: 结果显示，微小的人口统计变化会破坏高达三分之一的蜕变关系，存在一致的偏见层级，种族线索扰动是违反公平性的主要原因。

Conclusion: RAG中的检索组件需要仔细策划以防止偏见放大，为开发者和组织采用可访问的SLMs提供了实用警示，强调不能以牺牲公平性和可靠性为代价。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used across multiple domains but
continue to raise concerns regarding security and fairness. Beyond known attack
vectors such as data poisoning and prompt injection, LLMs are also vulnerable
to fairness bugs. These refer to unintended behaviors influenced by sensitive
demographic cues (e.g., race or sexual orientation) that should not affect
outcomes. Another key issue is hallucination, where models generate plausible
yet false information. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a
strategy to mitigate hallucinations by combining external retrieval with text
generation. However, its adoption raises new fairness concerns, as the
retrieved content itself may surface or amplify bias. This study conducts
fairness testing through metamorphic testing (MT), introducing controlled
demographic perturbations in prompts to assess fairness in sentiment analysis
performed by three Small Language Models (SLMs) hosted on HuggingFace
(Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct, Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3, and Llama-3.1-Nemotron-8B),
each integrated into a RAG pipeline. Results show that minor demographic
variations can break up to one third of metamorphic relations (MRs). A detailed
analysis of these failures reveals a consistent bias hierarchy, with
perturbations involving racial cues being the predominant cause of the
violations. In addition to offering a comparative evaluation, this work
reinforces that the retrieval component in RAG must be carefully curated to
prevent bias amplification. The findings serve as a practical alert for
developers, testers and small organizations aiming to adopt accessible SLMs
without compromising fairness or reliability.

TL;DR: ImitSAT是基于模仿学习的CDCL求解器分支策略，通过从专家KeyTrace中学习决策序列，直接减少传播次数，提升SAT求解效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法要么预测实例级信号间接改进CDCL分支，要么依赖强化学习和不足的CDCL信息，无法直接优化分支决策。

Method: 从专家KeyTrace中学习，将完整运行压缩为生存决策序列，在相同实例上重放KeyTrace几乎无冲突，提供密集的决策级监督。

Result: ImitSAT减少了传播次数和运行时间，优于最先进的基于学习的方法。

Conclusion: ImitSAT通过模仿学习实现了高质量分支决策，训练收敛更快更稳定，并能无缝集成到CDCL求解器中。

Abstract: We propose ImitSAT, a branching policy for conflict-driven clause learning
(CDCL) solvers based on imitation learning for the Boolean satisfiability
problem (SAT). Unlike previous methods that predict instance-level signals to
improve CDCL branching indirectly, or rely on reinforcement learning and
insufficient CDCL information to enhance branching, ImitSAT learns from expert
KeyTrace that collapses a full run into the sequence of surviving decisions.
Replaying a KeyTrace on the same instance is nearly conflict-free, providing
dense decision-level supervision and directly reducing propagations -- the
dominant contributor to wall-clock time. This prefix-conditioned supervision
enables ImitSAT to reproduce high-quality branches without exploration,
yielding faster convergence, stable training, and seamless integration into
CDCL. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ImitSAT reduces propagation counts
and runtime, outperforming state-of-the-art learned approaches. We released the
source code and trained model at https://github.com/zewei-Zhang/ImitSAT

Conclusion: 双阶段测试时扩展框架通过明确分离规划和执行阶段，实现了更高效的推理过程探索，在保持准确性的同时显著提升了计算效率。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved significant advances in reasoning
tasks. A key approach is tree-based search with verifiers, which expand
candidate reasoning paths and use reward models to guide pruning and selection.
Although effective in improving accuracy, these methods are not optimal in
terms of efficiency: they perform simple decomposition on the reasoning
process, but ignore the planning-execution nature of tasks such as math
reasoning or code generation. This results in inefficient exploration of
reasoning process. To address this, we propose a dual-phase test-time scaling
framework that explicitly separates reasoning into planning and execution, and
performs search over the two phases individually. Specifically, we decompose
reasoning trajectories and develop reward models for each phase, enabling the
search to explore and prune plans and executions separately. We further
introduce a dynamic budget allocation mechanism that adaptively redistributes
sampling effort based on reward feedback, allowing early stopping on confident
steps and reallocation of computation to more challenging parts of the
reasoning process. Experiments on both mathematical reasoning and code
generation benchmarks demonstrate that our approach consistently improves
accuracy while reducing redundant computation.

Motivation: 解决在推理模型部署中面临的两个关键权衡：模型大小和推理预算，其中更大的模型和更高的推理预算会带来更好的性能，但也会增加成本和延迟。

Method: RADAR从心理测量学中汲取灵感，学习不同预算下模型对不同查询的响应模型，具有可解释的参数（查询难度和模型-预算能力），然后将难度较高的查询路由到能力较高的模型-预算对。

Result: 在8个广泛使用的挑战性推理基准测试中，RADAR相比最先进的模型路由方法表现出优越性能，并在所有基准测试中对分布外查询展现出强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: RADAR是一个可扩展的框架，能够通过动态选择少量评估查询来高效集成额外模型，估计它们的能力，从而在推理模型部署中实现有效的性能-成本权衡。

Abstract: Reasoning language models have demonstrated remarkable performance on many
challenging tasks in math, science, and coding. Choosing the right reasoning
model for practical deployment involves a performance and cost tradeoff at two
key levels: model size and reasoning budget, where larger models and higher
reasoning budget lead to better performance but with increased cost and
latency. In this work, we tackle this tradeoff from the angle of model
configuration routing for different queries, and present RADAR
(Reasoning-Ability and Difficulty-Aware Routing), a lightweight, interpretable,
and scalable routing framework. Inspired by psychometrics, RADAR learns an item
response model from model responses with different budgets to different
queries, with interpretable parameters including query difficulties and
model-budget abilities. RADAR then routes queries with higher difficulty to
model-budget pairs with higher ability, and vice versa. We conduct extensive
experiments on 8 widely used challenging reasoning benchmarks, demonstrating
the superior performance of RADAR compared to state-of-the-art model routing
methods. RADAR also exhibits query generalization capabilities, showing strong
performance on out-of-distribution queries in all benchmarks. RADAR is also
scalable and can efficiently integrate additional models by dynamically
selecting a small set of evaluation queries to estimate their abilities.

Abstract: Case definitions are essential for effectively communicating public health
threats. However, the absence of a standardized, machine-readable format poses
significant challenges to interoperability, epidemiological research, the
exchange of qualitative data, and the effective application of computational
analysis methods, including artificial intelligence (AI). This complicates
comparisons and collaborations across organizations and regions, limits data
integration, and hinders technological innovation in public health. To address
these issues, we propose the first open, machine-readable format for
representing case and syndrome definitions. Additionally, we introduce the
first comprehensive dataset of standardized case definitions and tools to
convert existing human-readable definitions into machine-readable formats. We
also provide an accessible online platform for browsing, analyzing, and
contributing new definitions, available at https://opensyndrome.org. The Open
Syndrome Definition format enables consistent, scalable use of case definitions
across systems, unlocking AI's potential to strengthen public health
preparedness and response. The source code for the format can be found at

Motivation: 现有RLVR方法存在训练瓶颈，性能提升随训练步数增加而显著下降，这源于稀疏的探索模式无法充分覆盖解空间。

Method: 在训练循环中嵌入结构化搜索，包括全局前沿选择策略、基于熵的路径选择和自适应回放缓冲区训练。

Conclusion: 通过系统化搜索而非延长计算时间来扩展推理能力是更有前景的方向，战略探索比暴力扩展更重要。

Abstract: Although RLVR has become an essential component for developing advanced
reasoning skills in LLMs, contemporary studies have documented training
plateaus that emerge following thousands of optimization steps, demonstrating
notable decreases in performance gains despite increased computational
investment. This limitation stems from the sparse exploration patterns inherent
in current RLVR practices, where models rely on limited rollouts that often
miss critical reasoning paths and fail to provide systematic coverage of the
solution space. We present DeepSearch, a framework that integrates Monte Carlo
Tree Search directly into RLVR training. In contrast to existing methods that
rely on tree search only at inference, DeepSearch embeds structured search into
the training loop, enabling systematic exploration and fine-grained credit
assignment across reasoning steps. Through training-time exploration,
DeepSearch addresses the fundamental bottleneck of insufficient exploration,
which leads to diminishing performance improvements over prolonged training
steps. Our contributions include: (1) a global frontier selection strategy that
prioritizes promising nodes across the search tree, (2) selection with
entropy-based guidance that identifies confident paths for supervision, and (3)
adaptive replay buffer training with solution caching for efficiency.
Experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that DeepSearch achieves
62.95% average accuracy and establishes a new state-of-the-art for 1.5B
reasoning models - using 5.7x fewer GPU hours than extended training
approaches. These results highlight the importance of strategic exploration
over brute-force scaling and demonstrate the promise of algorithmic innovation
for advancing RLVR methodologies. DeepSearch establishes a new direction for
scaling reasoning capabilities through systematic search rather than prolonged
computation.

*Jiacheng Shi,Hongfei Du,Y. Alicia Hong,Ye Gao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出CCoT-Emo框架，通过情感图引导大型音频语言模型进行情感推理，无需微调即可提升语音情感识别性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型音频语言模型在语音任务中表现良好，但在语音情感识别方面表现不佳，主要由于副语言建模能力弱和跨模态推理有限

Method: 引入结构化情感图，编码七种声学特征、文本情感、关键词和跨模态关联，通过组合式思维链提示引导模型推理

Result: 在多个SER基准测试中超越先前SOTA，相比零样本基线显著提升准确率

Conclusion: CCoT-Emo框架通过情感图提供可解释的组合式表示，有效增强LALM的情感推理能力

Abstract: Large audio-language models (LALMs) exhibit strong zero-shot performance
across speech tasks but struggle with speech emotion recognition (SER) due to
weak paralinguistic modeling and limited cross-modal reasoning. We propose
Compositional Chain-of-Thought Prompting for Emotion Reasoning (CCoT-Emo), a
framework that introduces structured Emotion Graphs (EGs) to guide LALMs in
emotion inference without fine-tuning. Each EG encodes seven acoustic features
(e.g., pitch, speech rate, jitter, shimmer), textual sentiment, keywords, and
cross-modal associations. Embedded into prompts, EGs provide interpretable and
compositional representations that enhance LALM reasoning. Experiments across
SER benchmarks show that CCoT-Emo outperforms prior SOTA and improves accuracy
over zero-shot baselines.

*Yoann Poupart*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TDHook是一个基于tensordict的轻量级通用可解释性框架，适用于任何torch模型，特别擅长处理复杂的组合模型，在CV、NLP和DRL等领域提供归因、探测和干预功能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的可解释性框架难以处理具有多个输入输出或使用可组合分离网络的复杂模型，如图像描述和深度强化学习等领域。

Method: 开发基于tensordict的轻量级框架，提供即用的归因、探测方法和灵活的干预API，旨在弥合不同方法类别之间的差距。

Result: TDHook依赖项极少，磁盘空间需求约为transformer_lens的一半，在基准测试中比captum快2倍，支持CPU和GPU上的多目标管道。

Conclusion: TDHook填补了复杂模型可解释性工具的空白，为现代可解释性流程提供了更易用的解决方案。

Abstract: Interpretability of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) is a growing field driven by
the study of vision and language models. Yet, some use cases, like image
captioning, or domains like Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), require complex
modelling, with multiple inputs and outputs or use composable and separated
networks. As a consequence, they rarely fit natively into the API of popular
interpretability frameworks. We thus present TDHook, an open-source,
lightweight, generic interpretability framework based on $\texttt{tensordict}$
and applicable to any $\texttt{torch}$ model. It focuses on handling complex
composed models which can be trained for Computer Vision, Natural Language
Processing, Reinforcement Learning or any other domain. This library features
ready-to-use methods for attribution, probing and a flexible get-set API for
interventions, and is aiming to bridge the gap between these method classes to
make modern interpretability pipelines more accessible. TDHook is designed with
minimal dependencies, requiring roughly half as much disk space as
$\texttt{transformer_lens}$, and, in our controlled benchmark, achieves up to a
$\times$2 speed-up over $\texttt{captum}$ when running integrated gradients for
multi-target pipelines on both CPU and GPU. In addition, to value our work, we
showcase concrete use cases of our library with composed interpretability
pipelines in Computer Vision (CV) and Natural Language Processing (NLP), as
well as with complex models in DRL.

Abstract: We present the design of an autoregressive active inference agent in the form
of message passing on a factor graph. Expected free energy is derived and
distributed across a planning graph. The proposed agent is validated on a robot
navigation task, demonstrating exploration and exploitation in a
continuous-valued observation space with bounded continuous-valued actions.
Compared to a classical optimal controller, the agent modulates action based on

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文揭示了基于语义ID的生成推荐系统存在扩展瓶颈，而直接使用大语言模型作为推荐器具有更好的扩展性，性能比语义ID方法提升高达20%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 发现基于语义ID的生成推荐系统在模型扩展时存在性能饱和问题，语义ID编码项目语义信息的能力有限是根本瓶颈。

Method: 比较两种生成推荐范式：基于语义ID的生成推荐和直接使用大语言模型作为推荐器，在44M到14B参数规模上进行实验分析。

Result: LLM-as-RS范式具有优越的模型扩展特性，比基于语义ID的生成推荐系统性能提升高达20%，且随着LLM规模扩大，其建模用户-项目交互的能力也在提升。

Conclusion: 基于语义ID的生成推荐存在内在扩展限制，而LLM-as-RS是构建生成推荐基础模型的有前景路径。

Abstract: Recent advancements in generative models have allowed the emergence of a
promising paradigm for recommender systems (RS), known as Generative
Recommendation (GR), which tries to unify rich item semantics and collaborative
filtering signals. One popular modern approach is to use semantic IDs (SIDs),
which are discrete codes quantized from the embeddings of modality encoders
(e.g., large language or vision models), to represent items in an
autoregressive user interaction sequence modeling setup (henceforth, SID-based
GR). While generative models in other domains exhibit well-established scaling
laws, our work reveals that SID-based GR shows significant bottlenecks while
scaling up the model. In particular, the performance of SID-based GR quickly
saturates as we enlarge each component: the modality encoder, the quantization
tokenizer, and the RS itself. In this work, we identify the limited capacity of
SIDs to encode item semantic information as one of the fundamental bottlenecks.
Motivated by this observation, as an initial effort to obtain GR models with
better scaling behaviors, we revisit another GR paradigm that directly uses
large language models (LLMs) as recommenders (henceforth, LLM-as-RS). Our
experiments show that the LLM-as-RS paradigm has superior model scaling
properties and achieves up to 20 percent improvement over the best achievable
performance of SID-based GR through scaling. We also challenge the prevailing
belief that LLMs struggle to capture collaborative filtering information,
showing that their ability to model user-item interactions improves as LLMs
scale up. Our analyses on both SID-based GR and LLMs across model sizes from
44M to 14B parameters underscore the intrinsic scaling limits of SID-based GR
and position LLM-as-RS as a promising path toward foundation models for GR.

*Kai Guo,Xinnan Dai,Shenglai Zeng,Harry Shomer,Haoyu Han,Yu Wang,Jiliang Tang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文首次系统研究了GraphRAG中的迭代检索，发现迭代检索能改善复杂多跳问题并提升桥接文档的排名，但存在噪声引入和桥接证据深度埋藏的问题。提出了BDTR框架来解决桥接证据排名问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的GraphRAG系统依赖静态检索，当关键证据（特别是连接不相关实体的桥接文档）缺失时，推理会崩溃并产生幻觉。迭代检索在GraphRAG中的作用尚未得到充分理解。

Method: 系统分析不同迭代检索策略与图基底的交互，提出Bridge-Guided Dual-Thought-based Retrieval (BDTR)框架，通过生成互补思维并利用推理链重新校准排名，将桥接证据提升到领先位置。

Result: 迭代检索能改善复杂多跳问题，帮助桥接文档进入领先排名，不同策略具有互补优势。但简单扩展会引入噪声降低精度，在单跳或简单比较问题上收益有限，部分桥接证据仍埋藏过深。

Conclusion: GraphRAG的有效性不仅取决于召回率，还取决于桥接证据是否能持续提升到支持推理链的领先位置。BDTR框架在不同GraphRAG设置中实现了一致的改进，为未来GraphRAG系统设计提供了指导。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a powerful paradigm for improving
large language models (LLMs) on knowledge-intensive question answering.
Graph-based RAG (GraphRAG) leverages entity-relation graphs to support
multi-hop reasoning, but most systems still rely on static retrieval. When
crucial evidence, especially bridge documents that connect disjoint entities,
is absent, reasoning collapses and hallucinations persist. Iterative retrieval,
which performs multiple rounds of evidence selection, has emerged as a
promising alternative, yet its role within GraphRAG remains poorly understood.
We present the first systematic study of iterative retrieval in GraphRAG,
analyzing how different strategies interact with graph-based backbones and
under what conditions they succeed or fail. Our findings reveal clear
opportunities: iteration improves complex multi-hop questions, helps promote
bridge documents into leading ranks, and different strategies offer
complementary strengths. At the same time, pitfalls remain: naive expansion
often introduces noise that reduces precision, gains are limited on single-hop
or simple comparison questions, and several bridge evidences still be buried
too deep to be effectively used. Together, these results highlight a central
bottleneck, namely that GraphRAG's effectiveness depends not only on recall but
also on whether bridge evidence is consistently promoted into leading positions
where it can support reasoning chains. To address this challenge, we propose
Bridge-Guided Dual-Thought-based Retrieval (BDTR), a simple yet effective
framework that generates complementary thoughts and leverages reasoning chains
to recalibrate rankings and bring bridge evidence into leading positions. BDTR
achieves consistent improvements across diverse GraphRAG settings and provides
guidance for the design of future GraphRAG systems.

Method: 开发了RadOnc-GPT自主代理系统，采用两层级评估框架：第一层级为结构化质量保证，评估人口统计学和放疗计划细节的准确检索；第二层级为复杂临床结果标注，涉及头颈癌患者下颌骨放射性骨坏死的确定以及前列腺癌和头颈癌队列中癌症复发的检测。

Result: 质量保证层级建立了结构化数据检索的基础信任，这是成功进行复杂临床结果标注的关键前提。

structured outcomes. Our evaluation explicitly validates RadOnc-GPT across two
clearly defined tiers of increasing complexity: (1) a structured quality
assurance (QA) tier, assessing the accurate retrieval of demographic and
radiotherapy treatment plan details, followed by (2) a complex clinical
outcomes labeling tier involving determination of mandibular osteoradionecrosis
(ORN) in head-and-neck cancer patients and detection of cancer recurrence in
independent prostate and head-and-neck cancer cohorts requiring combined
interpretation of structured and unstructured patient data. The QA tier
establishes foundational trust in structured-data retrieval, a critical

Motivation: 解决多智能体交互中出现的复杂动态和局部观察导致的信息不完整问题，构建有效的团队协作表示。

Method: 直接建模通信协议来构建表示空间，支持完全去中心化执行和隐式协调，避免显式消息传递的缺点。该表示既可作为隐式潜在变量，也可作为显式通信消息。

Result: 在四个具有挑战性的MARL基准测试中，IWoL的两个变体都表现出色，为团队协作提供了简单而强大的解决方案。该表示还能与现有MARL算法结合进一步提升性能。

Conclusion: IWoL框架通过联合建模智能体关系和世界信息，为多智能体协作提供了有效的表示学习方法，避免了显式通信的局限性。

Abstract: This work presents a novel representation learning framework, interactive
world latent (IWoL), to facilitate team coordination in multi-agent
reinforcement learning (MARL). Building effective representation for team
coordination is a challenging problem, due to the intricate dynamics emerging
from multi-agent interaction and incomplete information induced by local
observations. Our key insight is to construct a learnable representation space
that jointly captures inter-agent relations and task-specific world information
by directly modeling communication protocols. This representation, we maintain
fully decentralized execution with implicit coordination, all while avoiding
the inherent drawbacks of explicit message passing, e.g., slower
decision-making, vulnerability to malicious attackers, and sensitivity to
bandwidth constraints. In practice, our representation can be used not only as
an implicit latent for each agent, but also as an explicit message for
communication. Across four challenging MARL benchmarks, we evaluate both
variants and show that IWoL provides a simple yet powerful key for team
coordination. Moreover, we demonstrate that our representation can be combined
with existing MARL algorithms to further enhance their performance.

Conclusion: 先进的前沿模型在具有挑战性的诊断病例中远不及放射科医生。该基准测试突显了通用AI在医学影像中的当前局限性，并警告不要进行无监督的临床使用。

Abstract: Generalist multimodal AI systems such as large language models (LLMs) and
vision language models (VLMs) are increasingly accessed by clinicians and
patients alike for medical image interpretation through widely available
consumer-facing chatbots. Most evaluations claiming expert level performance
are on public datasets containing common pathologies. Rigorous evaluation of
frontier models on difficult diagnostic cases remains limited. We developed a
pilot benchmark of 50 expert-level "spot diagnosis" cases across multiple
imaging modalities to evaluate the performance of frontier AI models against
board-certified radiologists and radiology trainees. To mirror real-world
usage, the reasoning modes of five popular frontier AI models were tested
through their native web interfaces, viz. OpenAI o3, OpenAI GPT-5, Gemini 2.5
Pro, Grok-4, and Claude Opus 4.1. Accuracy was scored by blinded experts, and
reproducibility was assessed across three independent runs. GPT-5 was
additionally evaluated across various reasoning modes. Reasoning quality errors
were assessed and a taxonomy of visual reasoning errors was defined.
Board-certified radiologists achieved the highest diagnostic accuracy (83%),
outperforming trainees (45%) and all AI models (best performance shown by
GPT-5: 30%). Reliability was substantial for GPT-5 and o3, moderate for Gemini
2.5 Pro and Grok-4, and poor for Claude Opus 4.1. These findings demonstrate
that advanced frontier models fall far short of radiologists in challenging
diagnostic cases. Our benchmark highlights the present limitations of
generalist AI in medical imaging and cautions against unsupervised clinical
use. We also provide a qualitative analysis of reasoning traces and propose a
practical taxonomy of visual reasoning errors by AI models for better
understanding their failure modes, informing evaluation standards and guiding
more robust model development.

Motivation: 由于人类偏好数据有限，RLHF在自回归文本到图像生成中受到限制，需要探索不依赖外部奖励的学习方法。

Method: 提出IRIS框架，使用内在奖励进行强化学习，通过最大化模型的自不确定性来改进图像生成质量。

Result: 实验结果表明，IRIS在自回归文本到图像模型上的性能可与外部奖励方法相媲美甚至更优。

Conclusion: 最大化自不确定性而非自确定性可以改善自回归文本到图像生成，IRIS框架为无外部奖励的强化学习提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Despite the success of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) in
language reasoning, its application to autoregressive Text-to-Image (T2I)
generation is often constrained by the limited availability of human preference
data. This paper explores how an autoregressive T2I model can learn from
internal signals without relying on external rewards or labeled data. Contrary
to recent findings in text generation, we show that maximizing
self-uncertainty, rather than self-certainty, improves image generation. We
observe that this is because autoregressive T2I models with low uncertainty
tend to generate simple and uniform images, which are less aligned with human
preferences. Based on these observations, we propose IRIS (Intrinsic Reward
Image Synthesis), the first framework to improve autoregressive T2I models with
reinforcement learning using only an intrinsic reward. Empirical results
demonstrate that applying IRIS to autoregressive T2I models achieves
performance that is competitive with or superior to external rewards.

Motivation: 尽管选择性跳过VLM层可以提高效率，但由于对层跳过何时有益的有限理解，该技术仍未得到充分利用。

Method: 开发了一个使用信息论和学习理论的框架，分析VLM隐藏表示在LLM骨干网络中的演变，识别具有大冗余的层。

Result: 实验表明，跳过理论框架预测的冗余层可以实现更快的推理同时保持性能，而在这些条件之外应用跳过会导致模型性能下降。

Conclusion: 该理论框架为多种高效推理技术提供了统一的理论支撑，能够指导在保持性能的前提下有效跳过VLM层。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) achieve incredible performance across a wide
range of tasks, but their large size makes inference costly. Recent work shows
that selectively skipping VLM layers can improve efficiency with minimal
performance loss or even performance improvements. However, this technique
remains underused due to the limited understanding of when layer skipping is
beneficial. In this paper, we develop a framework that uses information and
learning theory to characterize the conditions under which layer skipping
enhances efficiency without sacrificing performance. Motivated by these
observations, we analyze the evolution of the VLM's hidden representations
through the LLM backbone and show that layers with large redundancy as
predicted by our framework coincide with those skipped by popular
layer-skipping methods in practice, providing a unified theoretical scaffolding
for multiple efficient inference techniques. Our experiments demonstrate that
skipping such layers yields faster inference that preserves performance, and
also show that applying skipping outside these conditions leads to model
degradation.

<details>

Motivation: 大型语言模型在处理复杂约束时往往无法生成最优、基于现实的解决方案，现实世界旅行规划任务需要处理明确、隐含甚至动态变化的约束，这凸显了对约束感知规划的需求。

Method: ATLAS采用多智能体框架，包含动态约束管理、迭代计划批评和自适应交错搜索等机制，专门设计用于处理约束感知规划中的基本挑战。

Result: 在TravelPlanner基准测试中，ATLAS将最终通过率从23.3%提升至44.4%，在实时信息搜索和多轮反馈的现实场景中达到84%的最终通过率，显著优于ReAct（59%）和单体智能体（27%）。

Conclusion: ATLAS是首个在现实世界旅行规划任务中展示定量有效性的工作，证明了其在处理复杂约束感知规划方面的优越性能。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable advancements in
reasoning and tool use, they often fail to generate optimal, grounded solutions
under complex constraints. Real-world travel planning exemplifies these
challenges, evaluating agents' abilities to handle constraints that are
explicit, implicit, and even evolving based on interactions with dynamic
environments and user needs. In this paper, we present ATLAS, a general
multi-agent framework designed to effectively handle such complex nature of
constraints awareness in real-world travel planning tasks. ATLAS introduces a
principled approach to address the fundamental challenges of constraint-aware
planning through dedicated mechanisms for dynamic constraint management,
iterative plan critique, and adaptive interleaved search. ATLAS demonstrates
state-of-the-art performance on the TravelPlanner benchmark, improving the
final pass rate from 23.3% to 44.4% over its best alternative. More
importantly, our work is the first to demonstrate quantitative effectiveness on
real-world travel planning tasks with live information search and multi-turn
feedback. In this realistic setting, ATLAS showcases its superior overall
planning performance, achieving an 84% final pass rate which significantly
outperforms baselines including ReAct (59%) and a monolithic agent (27%).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统编码方法无法充分捕捉电子健康记录中的丰富时序动态，而大型语言模型在临床事件序列和时序依赖推理方面存在困难。

Method: 将电子健康记录重新表述为带时间戳的事件链，通过自回归微调预测未来医疗事件，明确建模疾病进展模式和因果关系。

Result: 在肿瘤生存预测和临床诊断任务中，NEP在时序推理任务中比专业EHR模型AUROC提高4.6%，比通用LLMs C-index提高7.2%。

Conclusion: NEP框架实现了最先进的预测准确性，同时产生与已知疾病通路一致的临床可解释注意力模式，具有双重优势。

Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHRs) contain rich temporal dynamics that
conventional encoding approaches fail to adequately capture. While Large
Language Models (LLMs) show promise for EHR modeling, they struggle to reason
about sequential clinical events and temporal dependencies. We propose Next
Event Prediction (NEP), a framework that enhances LLMs' temporal reasoning
through autoregressive fine-tuning on clinical event sequences. By
reformulating EHRs as timestamped event chains and predicting future medical
events, NEP explicitly models disease progression patterns and causal
relationships. Extensive evaluations across oncology survival prediction and
clinical diagnosis tasks demonstrate NEP's superiority, outperforming
specialized EHR models by 4.6% AUROC and general-purpose LLMs by 7.2% C-index
in temporal reasoning tasks. Our analyses reveal dual benefits:
state-of-the-art prediction accuracy combined with clinically interpretable
attention patterns that align with known disease pathways.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly rely on external tools such as
search engines to solve complex agentic tasks that require reasoning and
external knowledge retrieval. Recently, reinforcement learning with verifiable
rewards (RLVR) has demonstrated its effectiveness in advancing capabilities of
LLMs by rewarding the final answers via outcome rewards. While straightforward
to supervise, outcome rewards only provide sparse signals and delayed feedback,
which limits their effectiveness on long trajectories. Process rewards address
this by evaluating intermediate steps, providing fine-grained supervision and
encouraging grounded problem solving. However, it is notoriously hard to
annotate step-wise labels, especially in non-verifiable process without
"golden" answers. Furthermore, step-wise judgment requires the balance between
local quality with contribution to the final outcome, as optimizing towards
higher process reward may not always align with better final outcomes. To
address the above challenges, we introduce Principle Process Reward (PPR), an
RL approach that unifies principled step-level assessment and outcome
verification. We train a principle-based reward model to improve the
transparency and reliability of process evaluation, and further introduce a
Reward Normalization (ReNorm) strategy to calibrate outcome and process
rewards. Experiment results show that PPR achieves state-of-the-art performance
across a wide range of benchmarks, demonstrating its impressive robustness and
generalization. Our code and model collection is available in this link.

TL;DR: Lita是一个轻量级代码代理框架，通过最小化人工设计来评估LLM的真实编程能力，在保持竞争力的同时显著减少token消耗和设计工作量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前代码代理设计依赖复杂的手工工作流和工具集，导致性能过度依赖提示调优、人类干预掩盖模型真实能力、构建维护成本高，且存在数据泄露风险。

Method: 引入Lita框架，基于"轻量"原则最小化人工设计，保留完全自主代理的基本要素，实现更忠实和统一的评估。

Result: 在Aider Polyglot和SWE-Bench上的实验表明，Lita相比基于工作流的基线方法达到竞争性或更优性能，同时消耗更少token和设计工作量。

Conclusion: Lita足以揭示现代LLM的底层编程能力，并提出代理复杂度定律：随着核心模型改进，不同复杂度代理间的性能差距将缩小至可忽略程度。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being applied to programming
tasks, ranging from single-turn code completion to autonomous agents. Current
code agent designs frequently depend on complex, hand-crafted workflows and
tool sets. However, this reliance on elaborate scaffolding presents several
challenges: agent performance becomes overly dependent on prompt tuning and
custom design choices, heavy human intervention obscures a model's true
underlying capabilities, and intricate pipelines are costly to build and
maintain. Furthermore, optimizing complex task prompts increases the risk of
data leakage. Currently, when introducing new models, LLM providers like OpenAI
and Anthropic often publish benchmark scores to demonstrate their models'
coding proficiency, but keep their proprietary evaluation frameworks
confidential. To address these limitations, we introduce Lita (Lite Agent),
which operationalizes liteness, a principle of minimizing manual design while
retaining the essential elements of a fully autonomous agent. Lita enables a
more faithful and unified evaluation without elaborate scaffolding. Experiments
on the Aider Polyglot and SWE-Bench with frontier models demonstrate that Lita
achieves competitive or superior performance compared to workflow-based and
agentic baselines. Crucially, Lita also consumes fewer tokens and requires
significantly less design effort. Our results suggest that Lita is sufficient
to reveal the underlying coding competence of modern LLMs. Finally, we propose
the Agent Complexity Law: the performance gap between agents of varying
complexity, from simple to sophisticated designs, will shrink as the core model
improves, ultimately converging to a negligible difference.

Motivation: 随着AI音乐生成服务的快速发展，理解人类如何感知AI音乐对于教育用户识别AI歌曲和改进现有模型都至关重要。

Method: 采用盲听图灵测试，参与者需要从一对歌曲中区分AI音乐和人类创作音乐。使用随机对照交叉试验设计，控制配对相似性，并采用来自商业模型Suno的真实世界AI音乐数据集。

Result: 研究发现，当音乐对相似时，听众区分AI音乐和人类创作音乐的可靠性会因果性地增加。内容分析显示听众主要依赖人声和技术线索进行判断。

Abstract: Recent advances in AI music (AIM) generation services are currently
transforming the music industry. Given these advances, understanding how humans
perceive AIM is crucial both to educate users on identifying AIM songs, and,
conversely, to improve current models. We present results from a
listener-focused experiment aimed at understanding how humans perceive AIM. In
a blind, Turing-like test, participants were asked to distinguish, from a pair,
the AIM and human-made song. We contrast with other studies by utilizing a
randomized controlled crossover trial that controls for pairwise similarity and
allows for a causal interpretation. We are also the first study to employ a
novel, author-uncontrolled dataset of AIM songs from real-world usage of
commercial models (i.e., Suno). We establish that listeners' reliability in
distinguishing AIM causally increases when pairs are similar. Lastly, we
conduct a mixed-methods content analysis of listeners' free-form feedback,
revealing a focus on vocal and technical cues in their judgments.

Method: 使用四个协调的智能体：规划智能体将用户需求解析为结构化蓝图，生成智能体生成可执行的C#脚本，自动化智能体处理引擎特定组件绑定和场景构建，调试智能体通过对话交互提供实时错误修正。

Conclusion: UniGen是第一个能够从自然语言需求自动生成可运行3D游戏的端到端框架，成功解决了现有方法的主要挑战。

Abstract: Developing 3D games requires specialized expertise across multiple domains,
including programming, 3D modeling, and engine configuration, which limits
access to millions of potential creators. Recently, researchers have begun to
explore automated game development. However, existing approaches face three
primary challenges: (1) limited scope to 2D content generation or isolated code
snippets; (2) requirement for manual integration of generated components into
game engines; and (3) poor performance on handling interactive game logic and
state management. While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate
potential capabilities to ease the game generation task, a critical gap still
remains in translating these outputs into production-ready, executable game
projects based on game engines such as Unity and Unreal Engine.
  To bridge the gap, this paper introduces UniGen, the first end-to-end
coordinated multi-agent framework that automates zero-coding development of
runnable 3D games from natural language requirements. Specifically, UniGen uses
a Planning Agent that interprets user requirements into structured blueprints
and engineered logic descriptions; after which a Generation Agent produces
executable C# scripts; then an Automation Agent handles engine-specific
component binding and scene construction; and lastly a Debugging Agent provides
real-time error correction through conversational interaction. We evaluated
UniGen on three distinct game prototypes. Results demonstrate that UniGen not
only democratizes game creation by requiring no coding from the user, but also
reduces development time by 91.4%. We release UniGen at
https://github.com/yxwan123/UniGen. A video demonstration is available at

Motivation: 当前对LLM代理的评估主要关注任务能力，但需要更深入地评估这些代理在面临现实决策时的选择行为，因为它们在人们生活的各个方面做出重要决策。

Method: 开发了ABxLab框架，通过控制选项属性和说服性线索来系统探测代理选择行为，应用于基于网页的购物环境，操纵价格、评分和心理暗示等影响人类选择的因素。

Result: 发现代理决策会可预测且显著地受到这些因素的影响，即使没有人类认知约束，代理仍然是强烈偏见的决策者。

Conclusion: 代理消费者的这种易感性既带来风险（可能继承和放大人类偏见），也带来机遇（为AI代理的行为科学研究提供了强大的测试平台）。

Abstract: Environments built for people are increasingly operated by a new class of
economic actors: LLM-powered software agents making decisions on our behalf.
These decisions range from our purchases to travel plans to medical treatment
selection. Current evaluations of these agents largely focus on task
competence, but we argue for a deeper assessment: how these agents choose when
faced with realistic decisions. We introduce ABxLab, a framework for
systematically probing agentic choice through controlled manipulations of
option attributes and persuasive cues. We apply this to a realistic web-based
shopping environment, where we vary prices, ratings, and psychological nudges,
all of which are factors long known to shape human choice. We find that agent
decisions shift predictably and substantially in response, revealing that
agents are strongly biased choosers even without being subject to the cognitive
constraints that shape human biases. This susceptibility reveals both risk and
opportunity: risk, because agentic consumers may inherit and amplify human
biases; opportunity, because consumer choice provides a powerful testbed for a
behavioral science of AI agents, just as it has for the study of human
behavior. We release our framework as an open benchmark for rigorous, scalable
evaluation of agent decision-making.

Conclusion: SMS方案通过自监督模型播种机制，成功实现了对用户真实样本遗忘效果的验证，为机器学习遗忘提供了可靠的验证手段。

Abstract: Many machine unlearning methods have been proposed recently to uphold users'
right to be forgotten. However, offering users verification of their data
removal post-unlearning is an important yet under-explored problem. Current
verifications typically rely on backdooring, i.e., adding backdoored samples to
influence model performance. Nevertheless, the backdoor methods can merely
establish a connection between backdoored samples and models but fail to
connect the backdoor with genuine samples. Thus, the backdoor removal can only
confirm the unlearning of backdoored samples, not users' genuine samples, as
genuine samples are independent of backdoored ones. In this paper, we propose a
Self-supervised Model Seeding (SMS) scheme to provide unlearning verification
for genuine samples. Unlike backdooring, SMS links user-specific seeds (such as
users' unique indices), original samples, and models, thereby facilitating the
verification of unlearning genuine samples. However, implementing SMS for
unlearning verification presents two significant challenges. First, embedding
the seeds into the service model while keeping them secret from the server
requires a sophisticated approach. We address this by employing a
self-supervised model seeding task, which learns the entire sample, including
the seeds, into the model's latent space. Second, maintaining the utility of
the original service model while ensuring the seeding effect requires a
delicate balance. We design a joint-training structure that optimizes both the
self-supervised model seeding task and the primary service task simultaneously
on the model, thereby maintaining model utility while achieving effective model
seeding. The effectiveness of the proposed SMS scheme is evaluated through
extensive experiments, which demonstrate that SMS provides effective
verification for genuine sample unlearning, addressing existing limitations.

Motivation: 建立首个正式评估LLM自我复制能力的基准测试，为未来研究设立标准，并帮助行业追踪多智能体系统效果和缓解自我复制威胁。

Method: 开发基于现代CLI工具的五任务套件，在受控环境中让LLM以代理方式执行任务，通过性能计算生成R分数和RCL-PCL分类。

Result: 评估多种开源和专有前沿模型发现，持续自我复制和多智能体系统面临重大障碍，包括上下文保留和多智能体决策问题。

Conclusion: 提出未来研究方向以安全降低这些障碍的严重性，可能减少未来更功能性多智能体系统的风险。

Abstract: We introduce SOCK, a benchmark command line interface (CLI) that measures
large language models' (LLMs) ability to self-replicate without human
intervention. In this benchmark, self-replication is defined not only as an
LLM's ability to create a functioning and running copy of itself, but also the
ability for that self-replication to persist and occur across different
computational contexts. Accordingly, we've developed a system to categorize
LLMs based on broad self-replication capabilities in two general classes,
Replication-Capability Levels (RCL) and Persistence-Capability Levels (PCL).
Using a five-task suite based on practically manipulable modern CLI utilities
and computer processes, experiments are orchestrated in a controlled
environment with an LLM acting agentically. The performance of the LLM on agent
tasks is then computed to produce an R-score (a quantitative evaluation of
overall self-replication ability) and data used to categorize LLMs into
specific RCL-PCL matrices. SOCK offers two primary contributions: (1) Provides
the first formalized definitions and benchmark suite for evaluating LLM
self-replication, with the goal of establishing a standard for future research,
to our knowledge; (2) Allows the industry to track the effectiveness of future
multi-agent systems and mitigate potential self-replication threat vectors
within them. The results compiled from evaluating a variety of open-weight and
proprietary frontier models reveal significant obstacles to persistent
self-replication and multi-agent systems, including context retention and
multi-agent decision-making. We propose future research directions to safely
reduce the severity of these obstacles, potentially lowering future risk of
more functional multi-agent systems.

Abstract: The automation of chemical research through self-driving laboratories (SDLs)
promises to accelerate scientific discovery, yet the reliability and granular
performance of the underlying AI agents remain critical, under-examined
challenges. In this work, we introduce AutoLabs, a self-correcting, multi-agent
architecture designed to autonomously translate natural-language instructions
into executable protocols for a high-throughput liquid handler. The system
engages users in dialogue, decomposes experimental goals into discrete tasks
for specialized agents, performs tool-assisted stoichiometric calculations, and
iteratively self-corrects its output before generating a hardware-ready file.
We present a comprehensive evaluation framework featuring five benchmark
experiments of increasing complexity, from simple sample preparation to
multi-plate timed syntheses. Through a systematic ablation study of 20 agent
configurations, we assess the impact of reasoning capacity, architectural
design (single- vs. multi-agent), tool use, and self-correction mechanisms. Our
results demonstrate that agent reasoning capacity is the most critical factor
for success, reducing quantitative errors in chemical amounts (nRMSE) by over
85% in complex tasks. When combined with a multi-agent architecture and
iterative self-correction, AutoLabs achieves near-expert procedural accuracy
(F1-score > 0.89) on challenging multi-step syntheses. These findings establish
a clear blueprint for developing robust and trustworthy AI partners for
autonomous laboratories, highlighting the synergistic effects of modular
design, advanced reasoning, and self-correction to ensure both performance and
reliability in high-stakes scientific applications. Code:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言导航方法在复杂场景中往往无法将指令与环境信息有效匹配，主要原因是缺乏常识推理能力，导致误判问题。

Method: 首先构建包含63万语言描述的知识库，通过知识匹配将环境子视图与知识库对齐；设计地标引导知识机制，利用指令中的地标信息指导代理关注最相关知识；提出知识引导动态增强机制，有效整合语言、知识、视觉和历史信息。

Result: 在R2R和REVERIE视觉语言导航数据集上的实验结果表明，LGK方法在导航误差、成功率和路径效率方面均优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: LGK方法通过引入外部知识库和地标引导机制，有效提升了视觉语言导航的性能，特别是在复杂场景中的常识推理能力。

Abstract: Vision-and-language navigation is one of the core tasks in embodied
intelligence, requiring an agent to autonomously navigate in an unfamiliar
environment based on natural language instructions. However, existing methods
often fail to match instructions with environmental information in complex
scenarios, one reason being the lack of common-sense reasoning ability. This
paper proposes a vision-and-language navigation method called Landmark-Guided
Knowledge (LGK), which introduces an external knowledge base to assist
navigation, addressing the misjudgment issues caused by insufficient common
sense in traditional methods. Specifically, we first construct a knowledge base
containing 630,000 language descriptions and use knowledge Matching to align
environmental subviews with the knowledge base, extracting relevant descriptive
knowledge. Next, we design a Knowledge-Guided by Landmark (KGL) mechanism,
which guides the agent to focus on the most relevant parts of the knowledge by
leveraging landmark information in the instructions, thereby reducing the data
bias that may arise from incorporating external knowledge. Finally, we propose
Knowledge-Guided Dynamic Augmentation (KGDA), which effectively integrates
language, knowledge, vision, and historical information. Experimental results
demonstrate that the LGK method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods
on the R2R and REVERIE vision-and-language navigation datasets, particularly in
terms of navigation error, success rate, and path efficiency.

Method: 利用背景知识的形式溯因解释框架，识别作为受保护属性不正当代理的特征，引入能力概念作为与群体成员无关的任务相关属性，通过映射函数评估跨群体同等能力个体的公平性。

Result: 在德国信用数据集上的概念验证展示了该框架在现实案例中的适用性。

Conclusion: 该框架能够有效解释AI决策中的代理歧视，揭示结构性偏见，为评估实质性公平提供新方法。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) systems in high-stakes domains raise concerns
about proxy discrimination, unfairness, and explainability. Existing audits
often fail to reveal why unfairness arises, particularly when rooted in
structural bias. We propose a novel framework using formal abductive
explanations to explain proxy discrimination in individual AI decisions.
Leveraging background knowledge, our method identifies which features act as
unjustified proxies for protected attributes, revealing hidden structural
biases. Central to our approach is the concept of aptitude, a task-relevant
property independent of group membership, with a mapping function aligning
individuals of equivalent aptitude across groups to assess fairness
substantively. As a proof of concept, we showcase the framework with examples
taken from the German credit dataset, demonstrating its applicability in
real-world cases.

approach enables the model to generate a bounding box around the object most

context-aware VQA responses increased the accuracy from 22.19% to 25.64%, with
an absolute increase of 3.45 percentage points, compared to the baseline

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决企业场景中Text-to-SQL系统需要针对单一数据库模式进行专业化，并能基于自有数据库进行评估的需求。

Method: 采用分层分区数据库模式、跨多个复杂度级别合成SQL查询，以及包含LLM验证、可执行性检查、自动修复和列平衡的质量感知流水线。

Result: 在BIRD基准测试子集上，SingSQL-LM-3B-R64达到82.87% Soft F1和73.03% EX上限，优于最佳3B规模基线+16.21 Soft F1和+12.36 EX。

Conclusion: SING-SQL为构建和评估企业级Text-to-SQL系统提供了一个可扩展、数据库无关的范式。

Abstract: Translating natural language questions into SQL has become a core challenge
in enabling non-technical users to query databases. While recent work has
explored large-scale synthetic data generation to improve model performance
through post-training, most efforts emphasize cross-domain generalization. This
leaves a gap for real-world enterprise scenarios, where models need to
specialize to a single database schema and organizations require to be able to
evaluate their Text-to-SQL systems on their own databases. To address this, we
introduce SING-SQL, a fully automated two-stage framework for generating
high-quality, high-coverage synthetic Text-to-SQL data for any target database,
without relying on SQL logs or manual annotations. Our approach hierarchically
partitions a database schema into sub-schemas, synthesizes SQL queries across
multiple complexity levels, and applies a quality-aware pipeline that includes
LLM-as-a-judge validation, executability checks, automatic repair, and column
balancing. We further release SingSQL-LM, a family of compact language models
fine-tuned on the synthetic data, achieving strong in-domain generalization. On
the subset of the BIRD benchmark, SingSQL-LM-3B-R64 reaches 82.87% Soft F1 and
73.03% EX upper bound with 32 candidates, outperforming the best 3B-scale
baseline by +16.21 in Soft F1 and +12.36 in EX. At the 1.5B scale,
SingSQL-LM-1.5B-R64 improves over prior systems by +9.30 in Soft F1 and +4.49
in EX. On synthetic evaluation sets, SingSQL-LMs exceed prior systems by wide
margins, establishing state-of-the-art performance among open models at
comparable scales. Our study of context management strategies reveals that
schema-free fine-tuning combined with schema-only inference provides the most
robust results. These findings establish SING-SQL as a scalable,
database-agnostic paradigm for producing and evaluating enterprise-grade
Text-to-SQL systems.

Conclusion: 该协作压缩方法能有效压缩超大型MoE模型，在保持高质量输出的同时实现高压缩比，为边缘部署提供了可行方案。

Abstract: The Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture is an important method for scaling
Large Language Models (LLMs). It increases model capacity while keeping
computation cost low. However, the ultra-large MoE models still have hundreds
of billions of parameters, requiring massive memory/storage and leading to
difficulties for deployment on resource-constrained edge platforms. Pruning or
quantization alone can hardly address the issue, because of the
super-aggressive compression ratio with significantly degraded accuracy and
output quality. To facilitate the deployment of ultra-large MoEs on edge
platforms, we propose a collaborative compression framework by combining expert
pruning, mixed-precision quantization, and activation optimization. It can
effectively reduce the storage footprint of the ultra-large MoE DeepSeek-V3
from 1.3TB to 103GB, while preserving high output quality with better accuracy
than traditional uniform low-bit quantization methods. To the best of our
knowledge, we are the first to deploy a compressed model from the ultra-large
DeepSeek-V3 on the platform with a strict 128GB total memory limit. Our
comprehensive experiments on multiple benchmarks under various memory
constraints demonstrate the effectiveness of our method with smaller model
sizes and higher accuracy than uniform low-bit quantization methods.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于异构图强化学习和专家系统的自动驾驶决策框架，在复杂交通环境中提升自动驾驶车辆的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决自动驾驶车辆在异构交通环境中面临的不同驾驶风格带来的挑战，这些复杂动态交互增加了决策难度。

Method: 使用异构图表示车辆间复杂交互，提出带有专家模型的异构图神经网络(HGNN-EM)编码车辆特征，结合双深度Q学习(DDQN)训练决策模型。

Result: 在典型四路交叉口场景的案例研究中，该方法在安全性、效率、稳定性和收敛速度方面优于多个基线方法，同时保持良好的实时性能。

Conclusion: 所提出的异构图强化学习框架能够有效提升自动驾驶车辆在复杂交通环境中的决策性能，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Navigating heterogeneous traffic environments with diverse driving styles
poses a significant challenge for autonomous vehicles (AVs) due to their
inherent complexity and dynamic interactions. This paper addresses this
challenge by proposing a heterogeneous graph reinforcement learning (GRL)
framework enhanced with an expert system to improve AV decision-making
performance. Initially, a heterogeneous graph representation is introduced to
capture the intricate interactions among vehicles. Then, a heterogeneous graph
neural network with an expert model (HGNN-EM) is proposed to effectively encode
diverse vehicle features and produce driving instructions informed by
domain-specific knowledge. Moreover, the double deep Q-learning (DDQN)
algorithm is utilized to train the decision-making model. A case study on a
typical four-way intersection, involving various driving styles of human
vehicles (HVs), demonstrates that the proposed method has superior performance
over several baselines regarding safety, efficiency, stability, and convergence
rate, all while maintaining favorable real-time performance.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: NePTune是一个神经符号框架，通过结合基础视觉模型的感知能力和符号推理的组合表达能力，解决了现代视觉语言模型在组合推理方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代视觉语言模型在各种任务中表现出色，但在组合推理方面存在困难，即分解和重组概念以解决新问题的能力。神经符号方法虽然有前景，但通常受限于严格的逻辑执行或预定义谓词，限制了灵活性。

Method: NePTune通过混合执行模型，将自然语言查询动态翻译为可执行的Python程序，这些程序结合了命令式控制流和能够在VLM生成的不确定性上进行推理的软逻辑运算符。该框架采用模块化设计，以训练免费的方式运行，将感知与推理解耦，但其可微分操作支持微调。

Result: 在多个视觉推理基准测试和各种领域中使用对抗性测试进行评估，NePTune相比强大的基础模型显示出显著改进，并展示了其在新颖环境中的有效组合泛化和适应能力。

Conclusion: NePTune通过神经符号方法成功克服了现有方法的局限性，在组合推理任务中表现出色，具有很好的泛化能力和适应性。

Abstract: Modern Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved impressive performance in
various tasks, yet they often struggle with compositional reasoning, the
ability to decompose and recombine concepts to solve novel problems. While
neuro-symbolic approaches offer a promising direction, they are typically
constrained by crisp logical execution or predefined predicates, which limit
flexibility. In this work, we introduce NePTune, a neuro-symbolic framework
that overcomes these limitations through a hybrid execution model that
integrates the perception capabilities of foundation vision models with the
compositional expressiveness of symbolic reasoning. NePTune dynamically
translates natural language queries into executable Python programs that blend
imperative control flow with soft logic operators capable of reasoning over
VLM-generated uncertainty. Operating in a training-free manner, NePTune, with a
modular design, decouples perception from reasoning, yet its differentiable
operations support fine-tuning. We evaluate NePTune on multiple visual
reasoning benchmarks and various domains, utilizing adversarial tests, and
demonstrate a significant improvement over strong base models, as well as its
effective compositional generalization and adaptation capabilities in novel
environments.

### [322] [Thinking Sparks!: Emergent Attention Heads in Reasoning Models During Post Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25758)
*Yein Park,Minbyul Jeong,Jaewoo Kang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 通过电路分析发现，后训练技术（如监督微调和强化学习）在大型推理模型中催生了功能专门化的注意力头，这些头支持结构化推理和计算。不同训练机制下这些头的演化方式不同，蒸馏和SFT促进稳定的推理头累积，而GRPO则采用动态搜索模式。研究揭示了复杂推理与基础计算之间的性能权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代大型推理模型的能力主要通过后训练技术解锁，但这些改进背后的架构机制仍然不透明。本研究旨在通过电路分析揭示后训练如何影响模型内部结构，特别是注意力头的功能专门化。

Method: 使用电路分析方法，比较Qwen系列和DeepSeek蒸馏模型在不同训练机制下的注意力头演化。通过消融实验和定性分析，连接电路级动态与宏观性能表现。

Result: 发现后训练催生了功能专门化的注意力头，不同训练机制下演化方式不同：蒸馏和SFT促进稳定推理头累积，GRPO采用动态搜索模式。可控思考模型没有专门的思考头，关闭显式推理会触发补偿机制。这些电路动态与性能权衡相关：强化头支持复杂问题解决，但可能导致简单任务上的过度思考失败。

Conclusion: 复杂推理能力的获得以基础计算能力为代价，存在固有的性能权衡。研究为未来训练策略设计指明了方向，强调需要在发展有效推理策略与确保可靠执行之间取得平衡。

Abstract: The remarkable capabilities of modern large reasoning models are largely
unlocked through post-training techniques such as supervised fine-tuning and
reinforcement learning. However, the architectural mechanisms behind such
improvements remain largely opaque. In this work, we use circuit analysis to
demonstrate that post-training for complex reasoning sparks the emergence of
novel, functionally specialized attention heads. These heads collectively
support structured reasoning and computation. Our comparative analysis across
Qwen families and DeepSeek-distilled model reveals that these emergent heads
evolve differently under different training regimes. Distillation and SFT
foster a cumulative addition of stable reasoning heads. In contrast, group
relative policy optimization operates in a dynamic search mode: relatively few
attention heads are iteratively activated, evaluated, and pruned, with their
survival closely tracking fluctuations in the task reward signal. Furthermore,
we find that controllable think on/off models do not possess dedicated thinking
heads. Instead, turning off explicit reasoning triggers a broader-but less
efficient-set of compensatory heads. Through ablation and qualitative analyses,
we connect these circuit-level dynamics to a crucial performance trade-off:
strengthened heads enable sophisticated problem-solving strategies for
difficult problems but can also introduce over-thinking failure modes, such as
calculation errors or logical loops on simpler tasks. These findings connect
circuit-level dynamics to macro-level performance, identifying an inherent
tension where complex reasoning comes at the cost of elementary computations.
More broadly, our work points to future directions for training policy design,
emphasizing the need to balance the development of effective reasoning
strategies with the assurance of reliable, flawless execution.

*Matt Keon,Aabid Karim,Bhoomika Lohana,Abdul Karim,Thai Nguyen,Tara Hamilton,Ali Abbas*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs在创意任务中倾向于生成安全、通用的文本，表现出向语言均值回归的趋势。通过广告创意测试发现，模型优先保留事实性内容而丢失创意特征，即使重新生成也难以恢复原始深度和独特性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估LLMs在创意任务中的表现，验证其是否存在向语言均值回归的趋势，以及能否真正处理创造性内容。

Method: 使用广告概念作为创造力压力测试，逐步简化广告创意，观察创意特征的消失顺序；要求模型从简化输入重新生成，结合定量比较和定性分析评估结果。

Result: 模型在简化过程中优先丢失隐喻、情感和视觉线索等创意特征，保留事实内容；重新生成的文本虽词汇多样但缺乏深度和原创性；提供特定创意线索可改善输出质量但仍依赖常见套路。

Conclusion: 缺乏针对性指导时，LLMs在创意任务中趋向平庸；结构化信号可部分抵消这种趋势，为开发创造力敏感模型指明方向。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) generate fluent text yet often default to safe,
generic phrasing, raising doubts about their ability to handle creativity. We
formalize this tendency as a Galton-style regression to the mean in language
and evaluate it using a creativity stress test in advertising concepts. When ad
ideas were simplified step by step, creative features such as metaphors,
emotions, and visual cues disappeared early, while factual content remained,
showing that models favor high-probability information. When asked to
regenerate from simplified inputs, models produced longer outputs with lexical
variety but failed to recover the depth and distinctiveness of the originals.
We combined quantitative comparisons with qualitative analysis, which revealed
that the regenerated texts often appeared novel but lacked true originality.
Providing ad-specific cues such as metaphors, emotional hooks and visual
markers improved alignment and stylistic balance, though outputs still relied
on familiar tropes. Taken together, the findings show that without targeted
guidance, LLMs drift towards mediocrity in creative tasks; structured signals
can partially counter this tendency and point towards pathways for developing
creativity-sensitive models.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 在TravelPlanner基准测试中，Planner-R1方法仅用180个训练查询就达到了56.9%的最终通过率，比GPT-5基线提高了2.7倍，是公开排行榜上最强的智能体结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大型语言模型在智能体强化学习中的表现，探索不同规模模型对奖励塑造的响应性，以及如何在保持泛化能力的同时提高效率。

Method: 使用Planner-R1方法进行智能体强化学习，重点研究奖励塑造技术，包括密集过程级信号，并比较8B和32B模型在不同奖励条件下的表现。

Result: 8B模型对奖励塑造高度敏感，在密集过程级信号下达到竞争性性能，比32B模型计算效率高3.5倍，内存效率高1.5倍。大模型在稀疏奖励下更稳健但增益较小。

Conclusion: 奖励塑造是扩展智能体强化学习的关键杠杆，8B模型是最有效的设置，这些效率提升不会牺牲泛化能力，在多个域外任务中保持或超过基线性能。

Abstract: We investigated Agentic RL with large language models on the
\textsc{TravelPlanner} benchmark. Our approach, \textsc{Planner-R1}, achieved a
\textbf{56.9\%} final-pass rate with only 180 training queries, a $2.7\times$
improvement over GPT-5's $21.2\%$ baseline and the strongest agentic result on
the public leaderboard. A central finding was that smaller models (8B) were
highly responsive to reward shaping: with dense process-level signals, they
reached competitive performance while being $3.5\times$ more compute-efficient
and $1.5\times$ more memory-efficient than 32B models. Larger models were more
robust under sparse rewards but exhibited smaller relative gains from shaping
and higher variance across runs. While curriculum learning offered no
significant benefit, shaped rewards consistently amplified learning dynamics,
making 8B models the most efficient setting for agentic RL. Crucially, these
gains did not come at the cost of overfitting: fine-tuned models mostly
maintained or exceeded baseline performance on out-of-domain tasks, including
\textsc{Multi-IF}, \textsc{NaturalPlan}, and $\tau$-\textsc{Bench}. These
results establish reward shaping as a decisive lever for scaling agentic RL,
highlight the competitive strength of smaller models, and demonstrate that
efficiency can be achieved without sacrificing generalization.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PureVQ-GAN是一种针对数据投毒攻击的防御方法，通过向量量化VAE和GAN鉴别器强制后门触发器通过离散瓶颈，有效破坏触发器模式同时保持语义内容。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据投毒攻击防御方法如基于扩散的方法需要数百次迭代优化步骤，计算成本高，难以在实际训练管道中应用。

Method: 使用向量量化VAE与GAN鉴别器结合，通过学习的码本对中毒图像进行量化，破坏细粒度触发器模式，同时GAN鉴别器确保输出符合自然图像分布。

Result: 在CIFAR-10数据集上，对Gradient Matching和Bullseye Polytope攻击实现0%投毒成功率，对Narcissus攻击为1.64%，同时保持91-95%的干净准确率，比基于扩散的防御方法快50倍以上。

Conclusion: PureVQ-GAN提供了一种高效实用的数据投毒防御方案，在保持高防御效果的同时显著提升了计算效率。

Abstract: We introduce PureVQ-GAN, a defense against data poisoning that forces
backdoor triggers through a discrete bottleneck using Vector-Quantized VAE with
GAN discriminator. By quantizing poisoned images through a learned codebook,
PureVQ-GAN destroys fine-grained trigger patterns while preserving semantic
content. A GAN discriminator ensures outputs match the natural image
distribution, preventing reconstruction of out-of-distribution perturbations.
On CIFAR-10, PureVQ-GAN achieves 0% poison success rate (PSR) against Gradient
Matching and Bullseye Polytope attacks, and 1.64% against Narcissus while
maintaining 91-95% clean accuracy. Unlike diffusion-based defenses requiring
hundreds of iterative refinement steps, PureVQ-GAN is over 50x faster, making
it practical for real training pipelines.

*Xinzhe Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Chain-in-Tree (CiT) 是一个插件框架，通过自适应决定何时分支来优化树搜索效率，使用轻量级分支必要性评估方法，显著减少计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的树搜索方法在长时推理任务中效率低下，比简单迭代方法慢一个数量级，需要优化计算效率。

Method: 提出两种分支必要性评估方法：BN-DP（直接提示辅助LLM判断是否需要分支）和BN-SC（通过聚类候选动作估计一致性），集成到三种树搜索框架中。

Result: BN-DP在GSM8K和Math500数据集上减少75-85%的token生成、模型调用和运行时间，准确率损失可忽略；BN-SC节省高达80%但存在不稳定性。

Conclusion: CiT框架显著提升树搜索效率，辅助LLM质量对性能至关重要，BN-SC在确定性动作空间无需LLM，理论保证BN-DP不会增加模型调用。

Abstract: Test-time scaling enables large language models (LLMs) to improve performance
on long-horizon reasoning tasks by allocating additional compute at inference.
Tree-search-based approaches achieve state-of-the-art results in this setting,
but they are notoriously inefficient, often an order of magnitude slower than
simpler iterative methods. We introduce Chain-in-Tree (CiT), a plug-in
framework that adaptively decides when to branch during search rather than
branching at every step. CiT relies on lightweight Branching Necessity (BN)
evaluation methods: BN-DP (Direct Prompting), where an auxiliary LLM directly
judges whether a step requires branching, and BN-SC (Self-Consistency), which
clusters multiple candidate actions to estimate agreement. We integrate CiT
into three representative LLM-in-the-loop tree search frameworks: Tree of
Thoughts (ToT-BS), ReST-MCTS, and RAP, and evaluate across GSM8K and Math500.
Our results show that: (1) BN-DP consistently reduces token generation, model
invocations, and runtime by 75-85 percent across all settings, with negligible
accuracy loss and sometimes accuracy gains; (2) BN-SC typically yields
substantial savings (up to 80 percent) but shows instability in 1-4 out of 14
settings, caused by a small subset of examples that produce very long reasoning
steps; (3) the quality of auxiliary LLMs is critical, not only the BN evaluator
in BN-DP, but also the models used in BN-SC for clustering and equivalence
checking. When these roles are filled by smaller LLMs, performance degrades.
Importantly, BN-SC does not require LLMs in domains with deterministic action
spaces, where clustering can be done programmatically. We also provide a
theoretical guarantee that BN-DP never increases LLM invocations relative to
the baseline and release a unified implementation of CiT across ToT-BS,
ReST-MCTS, and RAP to facilitate reproducibility and extension.

TL;DR: 本文提出HiStyle，一种基于层次化预测和对比学习的可控语音合成方法，通过两阶段风格嵌入预测器提升文本描述到语音风格的控制能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有可控语音合成系统通过预测全局风格嵌入来实现文本描述控制，但忽略了风格嵌入的底层分布结构，限制了系统的控制潜力。

Method: 使用t-SNE分析发现风格嵌入存在层次聚类模式，据此提出HiStyle两阶段风格嵌入预测器，结合对比学习对齐文本和音频嵌入空间，并提出统计方法与人类听觉偏好结合的标注策略。

Result: 实验表明HiStyle相比其他方法在风格可控性上显著提升，同时保持了语音的自然度和清晰度。

Conclusion: HiStyle通过层次化风格嵌入预测和对比学习，有效提升了基于文本描述的可控语音合成性能。

Abstract: Controllable speech synthesis refers to the precise control of speaking style
by manipulating specific prosodic and paralinguistic attributes, such as
gender, volume, speech rate, pitch, and pitch fluctuation. With the integration
of advanced generative models, particularly large language models (LLMs) and
diffusion models, controllable text-to-speech (TTS) systems have increasingly
transitioned from label-based control to natural language description-based
control, which is typically implemented by predicting global style embeddings
from textual prompts. However, this straightforward prediction overlooks the
underlying distribution of the style embeddings, which may hinder the full
potential of controllable TTS systems. In this study, we use t-SNE analysis to
visualize and analyze the global style embedding distribution of various
mainstream TTS systems, revealing a clear hierarchical clustering pattern:
embeddings first cluster by timbre and subsequently subdivide into finer
clusters based on style attributes. Based on this observation, we propose
HiStyle, a two-stage style embedding predictor that hierarchically predicts
style embeddings conditioned on textual prompts, and further incorporate
contrastive learning to help align the text and audio embedding spaces.
Additionally, we propose a style annotation strategy that leverages the
complementary strengths of statistical methodologies and human auditory
preferences to generate more accurate and perceptually consistent textual
prompts for style control. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that when
applied to the base TTS model, HiStyle achieves significantly better style
controllability than alternative style embedding predicting approaches while
preserving high speech quality in terms of naturalness and intelligibility.

TL;DR: ASGuard是一个基于机制分析的框架，通过识别与时态攻击相关的注意力头，训练精确的缩放向量来重新校准激活值，并通过预防性微调增强模型的拒绝机制，有效降低针对性越狱攻击的成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大型语言模型经过安全对齐，但简单的语言变化（如时态改变）就能绕过其拒绝行为，这揭示了当前对齐方法存在关键泛化差距，且其底层机制理解不足。

Method: 1. 使用电路分析识别与时态攻击相关的特定注意力头；2. 训练通道级缩放向量重新校准脆弱头的激活值；3. 应用预防性微调，迫使模型学习更稳健的拒绝机制。

Result: 在三个LLM上，ASGuard有效降低了针对性越狱攻击的成功率，同时保持通用能力并最小化过度拒绝，实现了安全性和实用性的帕累托最优平衡。

Conclusion: 研究展示了如何利用对模型内部机制的深入理解来开发实用、高效和针对性的方法调整模型行为，为更可靠和可解释的AI安全指明了方向。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs), despite being safety-aligned, exhibit brittle
refusal behaviors that can be circumvented by simple linguistic changes. As
tense jailbreaking demonstrates that models refusing harmful requests often
comply when rephrased in past tense, a critical generalization gap is revealed
in current alignment methods whose underlying mechanisms are poorly understood.
In this work, we introduce Activation-Scaling Guard (ASGuard), an insightful,
mechanistically-informed framework that surgically mitigates this specific
vulnerability. For the first step, we use circuit analysis to identify the
specific attention heads causally linked to the targeted jailbreaking, the
tense-changing attack. Second, we train a precise, channel-wise scaling vector
to recalibrate the activation of tense vulnerable heads. Lastly, we apply it
into a "preventative fine-tuning", forcing the model to learn a more robust
refusal mechanism. Across three LLMs, ASGuard effectively reduces the attack
success rate of targeted jailbreaking while preserving general capabilities and
minimizing over refusal, achieving a Pareto-optimal balance between safety and
utility. Our findings underscore how adversarial suffixes suppress the
propagation of the refusal-mediating direction, based on mechanistic analysis.
Furthermore, our work showcases how a deep understanding of model internals can
be leveraged to develop practical, efficient, and targeted methods for
adjusting model behavior, charting a course for more reliable and interpretable
AI safety.

Motivation: 具身LLM代理在与物理世界交互时面临安全漏洞，需要在任务理解、环境感知、高层规划和低层动作生成等推理阶段进行系统性的安全保护。

Method: 提出SafeMindBench多模态基准测试（5,558个样本）和SafeMindAgent架构，采用模块化的规划器-执行器设计，集成三个级联安全模块，将事实性、因果性和时序性安全约束融入推理过程。

Result: 实验表明主流LLM和具身代理存在安全关键失败，而SafeMindAgent显著提高了安全率，同时保持可比较的任务完成度。

Conclusion: SafeMindBench和SafeMindAgent为具身LLM代理的安全风险提供了系统评估框架和实用解决方案，推动了该领域的安全研究。

Abstract: Embodied agents powered by large language models (LLMs) inherit advanced
planning capabilities; however, their direct interaction with the physical
world exposes them to safety vulnerabilities. In this work, we identify four
key reasoning stages where hazards may arise: Task Understanding, Environment
Perception, High-Level Plan Generation, and Low-Level Action Generation. We
further formalize three orthogonal safety constraint types (Factual, Causal,
and Temporal) to systematically characterize potential safety violations.
Building on this risk model, we present SafeMindBench, a multimodal benchmark
with 5,558 samples spanning four task categories (Instr-Risk, Env-Risk,
Order-Fix, Req-Align) across high-risk scenarios such as sabotage, harm,
privacy, and illegal behavior. Extensive experiments on SafeMindBench reveal
that leading LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o) and widely used embodied agents remain
susceptible to safety-critical failures. To address this challenge, we
introduce SafeMindAgent, a modular Planner-Executor architecture integrated
with three cascaded safety modules, which incorporate safety constraints into
the reasoning process. Results show that SafeMindAgent significantly improves
safety rate over strong baselines while maintaining comparable task completion.
Together, SafeMindBench and SafeMindAgent provide both a rigorous evaluation
suite and a practical solution that advance the systematic study and mitigation
of safety risks in embodied LLM agents.

Motivation: 当前LLMs基准测试过于强调纯JSON生成，而忽略了数据理解和提取能力，这与实际网络数据挖掘任务相关性不足。

Method: 创建包含2100个多领域实例的DeepJSONEval基准测试，具有深层嵌套结构，并按难度分类来评估LLMs性能。

Result: 实验显示不同LLMs在处理复杂嵌套JSON结构时存在显著性能差距。

Conclusion: DeepJSONEval基准测试和数据集已开源，旨在推动结构化JSON生成研究的发展。

Abstract: The internet is saturated with low-density, high-redundancy information, such
as social media comments, repetitive news, and lengthy discussions, making it
difficult to extract valuable insights efficiently. Multi-layer nested JSON
structures provide an effective solution by compressing such information into
semantically rich, hierarchical representations, which organize data into
key-value pairs, arrays, and nested objects, preserving contextual
relationships and enabling efficient storage, retrieval, and semantic querying.
For instance, in news aggregation, a JSON object can nest an article's metadata
(title, author, date), content (text, multimedia), and multimedia information
(multimedia type, caption) hierarchically. Large Language Models (LLMs) play a
transformative role in web data mining by parsing unstructured text and
outputting structured results directly into complex JSON schemas. However,
current benchmarks for evaluating LLMs' JSON output capabilities overemphasize
pure JSON generation rather than assessing data comprehension and extraction
abilities, a limitation that lacks relevance to practical web data mining
tasks. To address this, we introduce DeepJSONEval, a novel benchmark featuring
2100 multi-domain instances with deep nested structures, categorized by
difficulty. Experiments show significant performance gaps among LLMs in
handling such complexity. Our benchmark and datasets are open-sourced to
advance research in structured JSON
generation.(https://github.com/GTS-AI-Infra-Lab-SotaS/DeepJSONEval).

Abstract: The integration of vital signs in healthcare has witnessed a steady rise,
promising health professionals to assist in their daily tasks to improve
patient treatment. In life-threatening situations, like rescue operations,
crucial decisions need to be made in the shortest possible amount of time to
ensure that excellent treatment is provided during life-saving measurements.
The integration of vital signs in the treatment holds the potential to improve
time utilization for rescuers in such critical situations. They furthermore
serve to support health professionals during the treatment with useful
information and suggestions. To achieve such a goal, the KIRETT project serves
to provide treatment recommendations and situation detection, combined on a
wrist-worn wearable for rescue operations.This paper aims to present the
significant role of vital signs in the improvement of decision-making during
rescue operations and show their impact on health professionals and patients in
need.

Abstract: Healthcare and Medicine are under constant pressure to provide patient-driven
medical expertise to ensure a fast and accurate treatment of the patient. In
such scenarios, the diagnosis contains, the family history, long term medical
data and a detailed consultation with the patient. In time-critical
emergencies, such conversation and time-consuming elaboration are not possible.
Rescue services need to provide fast, reliable treatments for the patient in
need. With the help of modern technologies, like treatment recommendations,
real-time vitals-monitoring, and situation detection through artificial
intelligence (AI) a situation can be analyzed and supported in providing fast,
accurate patient-data-driven medical treatments. In KIRETT, a wearable device
is developed to support in such scenarios and presents a way to provide
treatment recommendation in rescue services. The objective of this paper is to
present the quantitative results of a two-day KIRETT evaluation (14
participants) to analyze the needs of rescue operators in healthcare.

### [335] [Boosting Process-Correct CoT Reasoning by Modeling Solvability of Multiple-Choice QA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25941)
*Raphael Schumann,Stefan Riezler*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文研究了大型语言模型在推理过程中生成有效中间步骤的重要性，通过多选问答任务分析发现：当问题对模型来说难以解决时，更容易出现虚假的思维链，导致误报。作者提出基于问题可解性估计的方法来改进奖励模型和强化学习，显著提高了过程正确推理率和答案准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大型语言模型推理质量不仅需要正确答案，还需要生成有效的中间推理步骤。在多选问答环境中发现，当问题难以解决时，模型容易产生虚假的思维链推理，导致误报现象。

Method: 通过估计每个问题的可解性，识别出最有效的学习区间。基于此，改进结果监督的奖励模型和强化学习，在目标函数中融入可解性因素，使用组相对优势方法。

Result: 在数学和多模态数据集上的实验表明，这些改进方法持续提高了过程正确推理率，在强化学习中还提升了答案准确性。

Conclusion: 可解性是减少思维链推理中幻觉现象、提高可靠性的关键因素，将可解性纳入训练目标可以显著改善模型的推理质量。

Abstract: Reasoning quality in large language models depends not only on producing
correct answers but also on generating valid intermediate steps. We study this
through multiple-choice question answering (MCQA), which provides a controlled
setting with fixed answer options. Our analysis shows that when questions are
effectively unsolvable for a model, spurious chains of thought (CoTs) are more
likely to appear, leading to false positives. By estimating the solvability of
each question, we uncover an intermediate regime where learning is most
effective. Building on this insight, we adapt outcome-supervised reward models
and reinforcement learning with group-relative advantage to incorporate
solvability into their objectives. Across experiments on math and multimodal
datasets, these modifications consistently yield higher rates of
process-correct reasoning and, in reinforcement learning, improved answer
accuracy as well. Our results highlight solvability as a key factor for
reducing hallucinations and increasing reliability in CoT reasoning.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了NuRisk数据集，用于自动驾驶中的时空风险推理，包含2900个场景和110万个代理级样本，基于真实世界数据和模拟器数据，提供BEV序列图像和定量风险标注。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于视觉语言模型的方法主要在静态图像中定位代理并提供定性判断，缺乏捕捉风险随时间演变的时空推理能力。

Method: 构建NuRisk数据集，使用真实世界数据（nuScenes、Waymo）和模拟器数据（CommonRoad），提供BEV序列图像和定量风险标注。对知名VLM进行基准测试，并微调7B VLM代理。

Result: 知名VLM在时空推理方面表现不佳，峰值准确率仅33%且延迟高。微调后的7B VLM代理将准确率提升至41%，延迟降低75%，展现出明确的时空推理能力。

Conclusion: 虽然取得了显著进展，但41%的准确率仍表明该任务的挑战性，NuRisk成为推进自动驾驶时空推理的关键基准。

Abstract: Understanding risk in autonomous driving requires not only perception and
prediction, but also high-level reasoning about agent behavior and context.
Current Vision Language Models (VLMs)-based methods primarily ground agents in
static images and provide qualitative judgments, lacking the spatio-temporal
reasoning needed to capture how risks evolve over time. To address this gap, we
propose NuRisk, a comprehensive Visual Question Answering (VQA) dataset
comprising 2,900 scenarios and 1.1 million agent-level samples, built on
real-world data from nuScenes and Waymo, supplemented with safety-critical
scenarios from the CommonRoad simulator. The dataset provides Bird-Eye-View
(BEV) based sequential images with quantitative, agent-level risk annotations,
enabling spatio-temporal reasoning. We benchmark well-known VLMs across
different prompting techniques and find that they fail to perform explicit
spatio-temporal reasoning, resulting in a peak accuracy of 33% at high latency.
To address these shortcomings, our fine-tuned 7B VLM agent improves accuracy to
41% and reduces latency by 75%, demonstrating explicit spatio-temporal
reasoning capabilities that proprietary models lacked. While this represents a
significant step forward, the modest accuracy underscores the profound
challenge of the task, establishing NuRisk as a critical benchmark for
advancing spatio-temporal reasoning in autonomous driving.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动模型发现方法在平衡细节捕捉与泛化能力方面存在挑战，需要解决模型复杂性与训练数据泛化之间的权衡问题。

Method: 使用两个视觉语言模型模块：AnalyzerVLM自主规划多步骤分析来提出候选模型，EvaluatorVLM从定量和感知角度评估模型对局部细节的适应性和整体趋势的泛化能力。

Result: 该管道能够有效发现既能捕捉精细细节又能确保强泛化能力的模型，消融研究表明多模态和多步骤推理对发现优质模型至关重要。

Conclusion: 多模态多步骤方法在自动模型发现中具有显著优势，能够平衡细节捕捉与泛化能力，为复杂搜索空间中的模型选择提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Automated model discovery is the process of automatically searching and
identifying the most appropriate model for a given dataset over a large
combinatorial search space. Existing approaches, however, often face challenges
in balancing the capture of fine-grained details with ensuring generalizability
beyond training data regimes with a reasonable model complexity. In this paper,
we present a multi-modal \& multi-step pipeline for effective automated model
discovery. Our approach leverages two vision-language-based modules (VLM),
AnalyzerVLM and EvaluatorVLM, for effective model proposal and evaluation in an
agentic way. AnalyzerVLM autonomously plans and executes multi-step analyses to
propose effective candidate models. EvaluatorVLM assesses the candidate models
both quantitatively and perceptually, regarding the fitness for local details
and the generalibility for overall trends. Our results demonstrate that our
pipeline effectively discovers models that capture fine details and ensure
strong generalizability. Additionally, extensive ablation studies show that
both multi-modality and multi-step reasoning play crucial roles in discovering
favorable models.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出RoRecomp方法解决RLVR训练中的冗长推理和低效探索问题，通过战略性地重组训练数据引导模型进行简洁推理


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准RLVR训练在推理任务中导致过度冗长的过程，在智能体设置中产生低效探索轨迹，因为仅基于结果的奖励不鼓励效率，且小批量中响应长度的高方差导致噪声优化信号

Method: RoRecomp将响应分为两类批次：1)优先级批次，结合短正确和长错误响应提供简洁性梯度信号；2)补偿批次，使用回放缓冲区中的剩余响应保持稳定性

Result: 在三个设置中展示显著效率提升：零RL训练中推理长度减少27.7%，智能体RL中不必要工具调用减少46.8%同时提高准确性，思维压缩中长度减少达52.5%，性能影响最小

Conclusion: RoRecomp是一种即插即用方法，能有效解决RLVR训练中的效率问题，在保持性能的同时显著提高推理和探索效率

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has proven effective in
eliciting complex reasoning in large language models (LLMs). However, standard
RLVR training often leads to excessively verbose processes (in reasoning tasks)
and inefficient exploration trajectories (in agentic settings), as outcome-only
rewards provide no incentive for efficiency and the high variance in response
length within relatively small rollout groups results in noisy optimization
signals. To address this, we propose Rollout Response Recomposition (RoRecomp),
a plug-and-play method that guides models toward concise reasoning by
strategically recomposing the training data. RoRecomp separates responses into
two distinct batch types: 1) priority batches, which combine short-correct and
long-incorrect responses selected from online batches to provide a clear
gradient signal for brevity, and 2) compensation batches, which utilize
remaining responses from a replay buffer to maintain stability and prevent
model collapse. To comprehensively evaluate effectiveness, we test RoRecomp
across three settings where results demonstrate substantial efficiency gains:
reducing reasoning length by 27.7% in zero RL training, reducing unnecessary
tool calls by 46.8% while improving accuracy in agentic RL, and achieving up to
52.5% length reduction in thinking compression, all with minimal performance
impact.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了CURE框架，通过检索增强的轻量级校正器检测和修正模型输出中的敏感信息泄露，实现高效机器遗忘。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决语言模型可能记忆和暴露敏感信息的问题，现有方法主要抑制敏感输出但无法消除底层知识且扩展性有限。

Method: 使用轻量级校正器验证模型输出是否包含目标知识，通过检索相关遗忘目标作为上下文参考进行检测和条件修正。

Result: CURE显著减少了信息泄露，即使在间接查询场景下也优于现有方法，同时保持响应质量和通用效用。

Conclusion: CURE在持续遗忘场景下表现出鲁棒性，适用于实际应用，通过检索增强实现无需额外训练即可适应新遗忘请求。

Abstract: Language models trained on web-scale corpora risk memorizing and exposing
sensitive information, prompting the need for effective machine unlearning.
Prior methods mainly focus on input queries to suppress sensitive outputs, yet
this often fails to eliminate the underlying knowledge and limits scalability.
To address this, we propose Corrective Unlearning with Retrieved Exclusions
(CURE), a novel unlearning framework that verifies model outputs for leakage
and revises them into safe responses. Specifically, CURE employs a lightweight
corrector that is applied to the original model to verify whether outputs
contain target knowledge and to rewrite them if any leakage is detected. To
efficiently handle large-scale unlearning requests, CURE retrieves unlearning
targets that are relevant to the initial response and provides them as
in-context references to the corrector for detection and conditional revision.
By leveraging this retrieval augmentation, the corrector can adapt to new
unlearning requests without additional training. Extensive evaluations
demonstrate that CURE substantially reduces information leakage, even from
indirect queries where prior works fall short, while maintaining response
quality and general utility. Moreover, it demonstrates robustness under
continual unlearning scenarios, making it practical for real-world
applications.

TL;DR: 提出了UMFDet统一框架，用于同时检测人类制作的虚假信息和AI生成内容，通过OmniFake数据集和混合专家适配器实现跨类型欺骗检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究将人类制作的虚假信息和AI生成内容分开研究，导致模型只能处理单一类型欺骗，而真实场景中内容类型未知，需要统一检测方案。

Method: 构建OmniFake数据集（12.7万样本），提出UMFDet框架，使用VLM骨干网络、类别感知MoE适配器和归因思维链机制来捕获欺骗信号。

Result: UMFDet在两种欺骗类型上都表现出稳健一致的性能，优于专业基线模型。

Conclusion: UMFDet为真实世界多模态欺骗检测提供了实用解决方案，能够有效处理未知类型的虚假内容。

Abstract: In recent years, detecting fake multimodal content on social media has drawn
increasing attention. Two major forms of deception dominate: human-crafted
misinformation (e.g., rumors and misleading posts) and AI-generated content
produced by image synthesis models or vision-language models (VLMs). Although
both share deceptive intent, they are typically studied in isolation. NLP
research focuses on human-written misinformation, while the CV community
targets AI-generated artifacts. As a result, existing models are often
specialized for only one type of fake content. In real-world scenarios,
however, the type of a multimodal post is usually unknown, limiting the
effectiveness of such specialized systems. To bridge this gap, we construct the
Omnibus Dataset for Multimodal News Deception (OmniFake), a comprehensive
benchmark of 127K samples that integrates human-curated misinformation from
existing resources with newly synthesized AI-generated examples. Based on this
dataset, we propose Unified Multimodal Fake Content Detection (UMFDet), a
framework designed to handle both forms of deception. UMFDet leverages a VLM
backbone augmented with a Category-aware Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Adapter to
capture category-specific cues, and an attribution chain-of-thought mechanism
that provides implicit reasoning guidance for locating salient deceptive
signals. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UMFDet achieves robust and
consistent performance across both misinformation types, outperforming
specialized baselines and offering a practical solution for real-world
multimodal deception detection.

Conclusion: CoLLM-NAS通过两个互补LLM的协作和知识引导搜索，有效解决了现有LLM-NAS方法的局限性，在性能和效率上都取得了显著提升，具有很好的通用性。

Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) with Neural Architecture
Search (NAS) has introduced new possibilities for automating the design of
neural architectures. However, most existing methods face critical limitations,
including architectural invalidity, computational inefficiency, and inferior
performance compared to traditional NAS. In this work, we present Collaborative
LLM-based NAS (CoLLM-NAS), a two-stage NAS framework with knowledge-guided
search driven by two complementary LLMs. Specifically, we propose a Navigator
LLM to guide search direction and a Generator LLM to synthesize high-quality
candidates, with a dedicated Coordinator module to manage their interaction.
CoLLM-NAS efficiently guides the search process by combining LLMs' inherent
knowledge of structured neural architectures with progressive knowledge from
iterative feedback and historical trajectory. Experimental results on ImageNet
and NAS-Bench-201 show that CoLLM-NAS surpasses existing NAS methods and
conventional search algorithms, achieving new state-of-the-art results.
Furthermore, CoLLM-NAS consistently enhances the performance and efficiency of
various two-stage NAS methods (e.g., OFA, SPOS, and AutoFormer) across diverse
search spaces (e.g., MobileNet, ShuffleNet, and AutoFormer), demonstrating its
excellent generalization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于LLMs的输出被误解为来自连贯模型的后验证据，但预测准确并不等同于概率校准，需要澄清这种误用。

Method: 提出将LLMs重新定义为高容量模式匹配器，用于在明确范围条件下的准预测插值，并引入独立抽样、预注册人类基线、可靠性验证和子组校准等实用防护措施。

Result: 建立了避免类别错误的框架，使研究人员能够进行有用的原型设计和预测，同时认识到LLMs的局限性。

Conclusion: LLMs应被视为模式匹配工具而非概率推理替代品，需要在明确范围条件下谨慎使用，并采用适当的验证和校准方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are being increasingly used as synthetic agents
in social science, in applications ranging from augmenting survey responses to
powering multi-agent simulations. Because strong prediction plus conditioning
prompts, token log-probs, and repeated sampling mimic Bayesian workflows, their
outputs can be misinterpreted as posterior-like evidence from a coherent model.
However, prediction does not equate to probabilism, and accurate points do not
imply calibrated uncertainty. This paper outlines cautions that should be taken
when interpreting LLM outputs and proposes a pragmatic reframing for the social
sciences in which LLMs are used as high-capacity pattern matchers for
quasi-predictive interpolation under explicit scope conditions and not as
substitutes for probabilistic inference. Practical guardrails such as
independent draws, preregistered human baselines, reliability-aware validation,
and subgroup calibration, are introduced so that researchers may engage in
useful prototyping and forecasting while avoiding category errors.

Result: 实验显示SafeEvalAgent有效，随着评估难度增加，模型安全性持续下降，例如GPT-5在欧盟AI法案上的安全率从72.50%降至36.36%，揭示了传统方法遗漏的深层漏洞。

Conclusion: 静态评估存在局限性，动态评估生态系统对于确保高级AI的安全和负责任部署至关重要，SafeEvalAgent框架能够有效发现传统方法无法检测的漏洞。

Abstract: The rapid integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into high-stakes
domains necessitates reliable safety and compliance evaluation. However,
existing static benchmarks are ill-equipped to address the dynamic nature of AI
risks and evolving regulations, creating a critical safety gap. This paper
introduces a new paradigm of agentic safety evaluation, reframing evaluation as
a continuous and self-evolving process rather than a one-time audit. We then
propose a novel multi-agent framework SafeEvalAgent, which autonomously ingests
unstructured policy documents to generate and perpetually evolve a
comprehensive safety benchmark. SafeEvalAgent leverages a synergistic pipeline
of specialized agents and incorporates a Self-evolving Evaluation loop, where
the system learns from evaluation results to craft progressively more
sophisticated and targeted test cases. Our experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of SafeEvalAgent, showing a consistent decline in model safety as
the evaluation hardens. For instance, GPT-5's safety rate on the EU AI Act
drops from 72.50% to 36.36% over successive iterations. These findings reveal
the limitations of static assessments and highlight our framework's ability to
uncover deep vulnerabilities missed by traditional methods, underscoring the
urgent need for dynamic evaluation ecosystems to ensure the safe and
responsible deployment of advanced AI.

Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) are increasingly used to represent biomedical
information in structured, interpretable formats. However, existing biomedical
KGs often focus narrowly on molecular interactions or adverse events,
overlooking the rich data found in drug leaflets. In this work, we present (1)
a hackable, end-to-end pipeline to create KGs from unstructured online content
using a web scraper and an LLM; and (2) a curated dataset, MEDAKA, generated by
applying this method to publicly available drug leaflets. The dataset captures
clinically relevant attributes such as side effects, warnings,
contraindications, ingredients, dosage guidelines, storage instructions and
physical characteristics. We evaluate it through manual inspection and with an
LLM-as-a-Judge framework, and compare its coverage with existing biomedical KGs
and databases. We expect MEDAKA to support tasks such as patient safety
monitoring and drug recommendation. The pipeline can also be used for
constructing KGs from unstructured texts in other domains. Code and dataset are

Method: 使用无监督LSTM自编码器提取用户推文的时间动态特征，通过注意力机制动态加权关键文本，构建多示例学习架构来提高用户级检测准确性。

Abstract: Depression is a major global public health challenge and its early
identification is crucial. Social media data provides a new perspective for
depression detection, but existing methods face limitations such as
insufficient accuracy, insufficient utilization of time series features, and
high annotation costs. To this end, this study proposes the LMILAtt model,
which innovatively integrates Long Short-Term Memory autoencoders and attention
mechanisms: firstly, the temporal dynamic features of user tweets (such as
depressive tendency evolution patterns) are extracted through unsupervised LSTM
autoencoders. Secondly, the attention mechanism is used to dynamically weight
key texts (such as early depression signals) and construct a multi-example
learning architecture to improve the accuracy of user-level detection. Finally,
the performance was verified on the WU3D dataset labeled by professional
medicine. Experiments show that the model is significantly better than the
baseline model in terms of accuracy, recall and F1 score. In addition, the
weakly supervised learning strategy significantly reduces the cost of labeling
and provides an efficient solution for large-scale social media depression
screening.

agents that use electronic health record (EHR) data. This guide is informed by
our experience deploying the "irAE-Agent", an automated system to detect
immune-related adverse events from clinical notes at Mass General Brigham, and
by structured interviews with 20 clinicians, engineers, and informatics leaders
involved in the project. Our analysis reveals a critical misalignment in
clinical AI development: less than 20% of our effort was dedicated to prompt
engineering and model development, while over 80% was consumed by the
sociotechnical work of implementation. We distill this effort into five "heavy
lifts": data integration, model validation, ensuring economic value, managing
system drift, and governance. By providing actionable solutions for each of
these challenges, this field manual shifts the focus from algorithmic
development to the essential infrastructure and implementation work required to
bridge the "valley of death" and successfully translate generative AI from
pilot projects into routine clinical care.

*Eric J. W. Orlowski,Hakim Norhashim,Tristan Koh Ly Wey*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文主张将社会科学中的定性方法整合到AI对齐实践中，提出基于Geertz'厚描述'概念的'厚输出'方法，强调AI系统应产生反映深层文化含义的输出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI文化对齐方法主要依赖定量基准和简单代理，无法捕捉人类文化的细微差别和上下文依赖性，需要根本性转变。

Method: 提出整合解释性定性方法，基于Clifford Geertz的'厚描述'概念，要求AI系统产生'厚输出'，并概述文化对齐成功的三个必要条件。

Result: 论文提出了文化对齐的新框架，强调充分范围的文化表征、细微输出能力以及输出在提示文化背景中的锚定。

Conclusion: 呼吁跨学科合作和采用定性、民族志评估方法，以开发真正具有文化敏感性、道德责任感和反映人类复杂性的AI系统。

Abstract: While cultural alignment has increasingly become a focal point within AI
research, current approaches relying predominantly on quantitative benchmarks
and simplistic proxies fail to capture the deeply nuanced and context-dependent
nature of human cultures. Existing alignment practices typically reduce culture
to static demographic categories or superficial cultural facts, thereby
sidestepping critical questions about what it truly means to be culturally
aligned. This paper argues for a fundamental shift towards integrating
interpretive qualitative approaches drawn from social sciences into AI
alignment practices, specifically in the context of Large Language Models
(LLMs). Drawing inspiration from Clifford Geertz's concept of "thick
description," we propose that AI systems must produce outputs that reflect
deeper cultural meanings--what we term "thick outputs"-grounded firmly in
user-provided context and intent. We outline three necessary conditions for
successful cultural alignment: sufficiently scoped cultural representations,
the capacity for nuanced outputs, and the anchoring of outputs in the cultural
contexts implied within prompts. Finally, we call for cross-disciplinary
collaboration and the adoption of qualitative, ethnographic evaluation methods
as vital steps toward developing AI systems that are genuinely culturally
sensitive, ethically responsible, and reflective of human complexity.

Motivation: 探索LLM作为独立推理代理在材料科学知识发现中的应用潜力，特别是在没有明确指令的情况下自主探索系统行为。

Method: 使用LangGraph工具功能为代理提供黑盒函数进行探索，通过儿童游戏验证方法有效性，然后应用于原子层处理反应器模拟。

Result: 证明LLM代理能够通过试错和持续探索，在有限探测能力下自主发现和利用化学相互作用，结果具有强路径依赖性。

Conclusion: LLM代理在材料科学知识发现中具有实际应用潜力，能够自主探索复杂系统并生成可推广的陈述。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have garnered significant attention for several
years now. Recently, their use as independently reasoning agents has been
proposed. In this work, we test the potential of such agents for knowledge
discovery in materials science. We repurpose LangGraph's tool functionality to
supply agents with a black box function to interrogate. In contrast to process
optimization or performing specific, user-defined tasks, knowledge discovery
consists of freely exploring the system, posing and verifying statements about
the behavior of this black box, with the sole objective of generating and
verifying generalizable statements. We provide proof of concept for this
approach through a children's parlor game, demonstrating the role of
trial-and-error and persistence in knowledge discovery, and the strong
path-dependence of results. We then apply the same strategy to show that LLM
agents can explore, discover, and exploit diverse chemical interactions in an
advanced Atomic Layer Processing reactor simulation using intentionally limited
probe capabilities without explicit instructions.

*Aline Mangold,Kiran Hoffmann*

TL;DR: 本文设计了一个基于Gienapp效用维度框架的人类中心化问卷，用于评估RAG系统输出，通过多轮迭代优化，最终包含12个评估维度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RAG系统在用户应用中广泛部署，但缺乏系统化、以人为中心的输出评估方法。

Method: 基于Gienapp效用维度框架设计问卷，通过多轮查询-输出对评分和语义讨论迭代优化，结合人类评分者和人-LLM配对反馈。

Result: LLM能可靠关注指标描述和尺度标签，但在检测文本格式变化方面表现较弱；人类难以严格关注指标描述和标签；LLM评分和解释被视为有用支持，但数值评分与人类不一致。

Conclusion: 最终问卷通过关注用户意图、文本结构和信息可验证性，扩展了初始框架。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems are increasingly deployed in
user-facing applications, yet systematic, human-centered evaluation of their
outputs remains underexplored. Building on Gienapp's utility-dimension
framework, we designed a human-centred questionnaire that assesses RAG outputs
across 12 dimensions. We iteratively refined the questionnaire through several
rounds of ratings on a set of query-output pairs and semantic discussions.
Ultimately, we incorporated feedback from both a human rater and a human-LLM
pair. Results indicate that while large language models (LLMs) reliably focus
on metric descriptions and scale labels, they exhibit weaknesses in detecting
textual format variations. Humans struggled to focus strictly on metric
descriptions and labels. LLM ratings and explanations were viewed as a helpful
support, but numeric LLM and human ratings lacked agreement. The final
questionnaire extends the initial framework by focusing on user intent, text
structuring, and information verifiability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在处理推理任务时由于状态-动作空间巨大和奖励稀疏性，存在探索不足和样本效率低的问题

Method: 引入全局多样性激励作为内在奖励，结合基于势能的奖励塑造机制，设计简单启发式方法防止奖励攻击

Result: DIVER在领域内和领域外任务上均优于竞争性RLVR基线，在Pass@1和Pass@k评估中表现优异

Conclusion: 全局序列多样性在激励深度探索方面发挥关键作用，DIVER框架能有效提升大语言模型的推理能力

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a
crucial paradigm for incentivizing reasoning capabilities in Large Language
Models (LLMs). Due to vast state-action spaces and reward sparsity in reasoning
tasks, existing methods often struggle with deficient exploration and poor
sample efficiency. In the paper, we propose \textbf{DIVER}
(\textbf{D}iversity-\textbf{I}ncentivized Exploration for
\textbf{V}ersatil\textbf{E} \textbf{R}easoning), an innovative framework that
highlights the pivotal role of global sequence-level diversity to incentivize
deep exploration for versatile reasoning. We first conduct a primary empirical
study to reveal a strong positive correlation between global diversity and
reasoning capacity. Building on this insight, we introduce global diversity
incentives as an intrinsic reward to promote deep exploration in a semantically
structured space. Incorporating the intrinsic reward, we develop a
potential-based reward shaping mechanism to preserve optimal policy invariance
and design simple heuristics to mitigate possible reward hacking. Experimental
results show that DIVER outperforms competitive RLVR baselines with various
exploration strategies on both in-domain and out-of-domain tasks, excelling in
both Pass@1 and Pass@k evaluations. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SlimPack是一个解决大语言模型分布式训练中上下文长度方差问题的框架，通过将样本分解为细粒度切片，采用非对称分区技术，在保持内存和通信效率的同时实现高达2.8倍的训练吞吐量提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型分布式训练受到上下文长度极端方差的严重阻碍，这种数据异构性导致工作负载不平衡和硬件利用率低下，现有解决方案往往以牺牲内存或通信效率为代价。

Method: 提出SlimPack框架，将样本分解为细粒度切片，采用非对称分区技术为前向和后向传播分别优化调度单元，通过两阶段求解器和高保真模拟器解决所有并行维度上的不平衡问题。

Result: 实验表明SlimPack相比基线实现了高达2.8倍的训练吞吐量提升，在保持高资源效率的同时提供了优越的负载平衡。

Conclusion: SlimPack通过重新思考数据打包和调度策略，突破了传统权衡，同时实现了优异的负载平衡和高资源效率，为大语言模型的高效分布式训练提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The efficient distributed training of Large Language Models (LLMs) is
severely hampered by the extreme variance in context lengths. This data
heterogeneity, amplified by conventional packing strategies and asymmetric
forward-backward costs, leads to critical inefficiencies such as cascading
workload imbalances and severe hardware underutilization. Existing solutions
attempt to mitigate these challenges, but often at the expense of memory or
communication efficiency.
  To address these challenges, we introduce SlimPack, a framework that
fundamentally rethinks data packing and scheduling by decomposing samples into
fine-grained slices. This slice-level decomposition immediately mitigates
critical memory and communication bottlenecks by transforming large, volatile
workloads into a stream of smaller, manageable units. This flexibility is then
harnessed for our core innovation, Asymmetric Partitioning, which assembles
balanced scheduling units uniquely optimized for the different demands of the
forward and backward passes. Orchestrated by a two-phase solver and a
high-fidelity simulator, SlimPack holistically resolves imbalances across all
parallel dimensions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SlimPack achieves
up to a $2.8\times$ training throughput improvement over baselines, breaking
the conventional trade-off by delivering both superior balance and high
resource efficiency.

Motivation: 解决长视野具身规划中的挑战，即世界不仅通过智能体的行动改变，外源过程（如水温升高、多米诺骨牌连锁反应）也会与智能体行动同时展开。

Method: 提出抽象世界模型框架，联合学习符号状态表示和因果过程（内源行动和外源机制），每个因果过程建模随机因果效应关系的时间过程，通过变分贝叶斯推理结合LLM提议从有限数据中学习。

Result: 在五个模拟桌面机器人环境中，学习到的模型能够实现快速规划，并能泛化到具有更多对象和更复杂目标的保留任务，优于一系列基线方法。

Conclusion: 该框架能够有效建模内源和外源因果过程，支持长视野规划并具有良好的泛化能力。

Abstract: Long-horizon embodied planning is challenging because the world does not only
change through an agent's actions: exogenous processes (e.g., water heating,
dominoes cascading) unfold concurrently with the agent's actions. We propose a
framework for abstract world models that jointly learns (i) symbolic state
representations and (ii) causal processes for both endogenous actions and
exogenous mechanisms. Each causal process models the time course of a
stochastic causal-effect relation. We learn these world models from limited
data via variational Bayesian inference combined with LLM proposals. Across
five simulated tabletop robotics environments, the learned models enable fast
planning that generalizes to held-out tasks with more objects and more complex
goals, outperforming a range of baselines.

TL;DR: ILR是一个多智能体协同学习框架，通过动态交互和感知校准来增强LLMs的独立问题解决能力，在数学和编程基准测试中比单智能体学习提升高达5%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在推理时需要重新执行多智能体系统，而人类认知表明个体可以通过互动提升推理能力并独立解决问题。研究多智能体交互是否能增强LLMs的独立问题解决能力。

Method: ILR框架包含动态交互和感知校准。动态交互根据问题难度和模型能力自适应选择合作或竞争策略，通过Idea3（想法分享、分析和融合）进行信息交换。感知校准使用GRPO训练LLMs，将一方的奖励分布特征整合到另一方的奖励函数中。

Result: 在三个LLMs和五个数学基准、一个编程基准上的实验表明，ILR始终优于单智能体学习，比最强基线提升高达5%。Idea3能增强强LLMs在多智能体推理中的鲁棒性，动态交互类型比纯合作或竞争策略更能促进多智能体学习。

Conclusion: 多智能体交互确实能增强LLMs的独立问题解决能力，ILR框架通过动态交互和感知校准有效提升了模型性能，为多智能体学习提供了新思路。

Abstract: Existing multi-agent learning approaches have developed interactive training
environments to explicitly promote collaboration among multiple Large Language
Models (LLMs), thereby constructing stronger multi-agent systems (MAS).
However, during inference, they require re-executing the MAS to obtain final
solutions, which diverges from human cognition that individuals can enhance
their reasoning capabilities through interactions with others and resolve
questions independently in the future. To investigate whether multi-agent
interaction can enhance LLMs' independent problem-solving ability, we introduce
ILR, a novel co-learning framework for MAS that integrates two key components:
Dynamic Interaction and Perception Calibration. Specifically, Dynamic
Interaction first adaptively selects either cooperative or competitive
strategies depending on question difficulty and model ability. LLMs then
exchange information through Idea3 (Idea Sharing, Idea Analysis, and Idea
Fusion), an innovative interaction paradigm designed to mimic human discussion,
before deriving their respective final answers. In Perception Calibration, ILR
employs Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to train LLMs while
integrating one LLM's reward distribution characteristics into another's reward
function, thereby enhancing the cohesion of multi-agent interactions. We
validate ILR on three LLMs across two model families of varying scales,
evaluating performance on five mathematical benchmarks and one coding
benchmark. Experimental results show that ILR consistently outperforms
single-agent learning, yielding an improvement of up to 5% over the strongest
baseline. We further discover that Idea3 can enhance the robustness of stronger
LLMs during multi-agent inference, and dynamic interaction types can boost
multi-agent learning compared to pure cooperative or competitive strategies.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of LLMs sparked significant interest in their potential
to augment or automate managerial functions. One of the most recent trends in
AI benchmarking is performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) over longer time
horizons. While LLMs excel at tasks involving natural language and pattern
recognition, their capabilities in multi-step, strategic business
decision-making remain largely unexplored. Few studies demonstrated how results
can be different from benchmarks in short-term tasks, as Vending-Bench
revealed. Meanwhile, there is a shortage of alternative benchmarks for
long-term coherence. This research analyses a novel benchmark using a business
game for the decision making in business. The research contributes to the
recent literature on AI by proposing a reproducible, open-access management
simulator to the research community for LLM benchmarking. This novel framework
is used for evaluating the performance of five leading LLMs available in free
online interface: Gemini, ChatGPT, Meta AI, Mistral AI, and Grok. LLM makes
decisions for a simulated retail company. A dynamic, month-by-month management
simulation provides transparently in spreadsheet model as experimental
environment. In each of twelve months, the LLMs are provided with a structured
prompt containing a full business report from the previous period and are
tasked with making key strategic decisions: pricing, order size, marketing
budget, hiring, dismissal, loans, training expense, R&D expense, sales
forecast, income forecast The methodology is designed to compare the LLMs on
quantitative metrics: profit, revenue, and market share, and other KPIs. LLM
decisions are analyzed in their strategic coherence, adaptability to market
changes, and the rationale provided for their decisions. This approach allows
to move beyond simple performance metrics for assessment of the long-term
decision-making.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有防御方法存在计算成本高、泛化能力有限或工作流程僵化等问题，无法有效检测复杂上下文中嵌入的恶意意图。受人类决策认知科学启发，需要开发更自适应和高效的防御机制。

Method: 提出SafeBehavior分层防御机制，包含三个阶段：意图推断检测明显输入风险、自我反省评估生成响应并基于置信度判断、自我修订自适应重写不确定输出同时保持用户意图和执行安全约束。

Result: 在五种代表性越狱攻击类型（基于优化、上下文操纵和提示攻击）上广泛评估，与七种最先进防御基线比较，SafeBehavior显著提高了鲁棒性和适应性。

Conclusion: SafeBehavior提供了一种高效且受人类启发的方法，能够在多样化威胁场景中有效保护LLMs免受越狱攻击尝试。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance across
diverse natural language processing tasks, but their growing power also
amplifies potential risks such as jailbreak attacks that circumvent built-in
safety mechanisms. Existing defenses including input paraphrasing, multi step
evaluation, and safety expert models often suffer from high computational
costs, limited generalization, or rigid workflows that fail to detect subtle
malicious intent embedded in complex contexts. Inspired by cognitive science
findings on human decision making, we propose SafeBehavior, a novel
hierarchical jailbreak defense mechanism that simulates the adaptive multistage
reasoning process of humans. SafeBehavior decomposes safety evaluation into
three stages: intention inference to detect obvious input risks, self
introspection to assess generated responses and assign confidence based
judgments, and self revision to adaptively rewrite uncertain outputs while
preserving user intent and enforcing safety constraints. We extensively
evaluate SafeBehavior against five representative jailbreak attack types
including optimization based, contextual manipulation, and prompt based attacks
and compare it with seven state of the art defense baselines. Experimental
results show that SafeBehavior significantly improves robustness and
adaptability across diverse threat scenarios, offering an efficient and human
inspired approach to safeguarding LLMs against jailbreak attempts.

Method: 使用光流从真实世界视频中提取时间信号，构建反映日常时间动态的数据集，并基于此提出REAL-V-TSFM数据集。

Result: 在三个最先进的时间序列基础模型上进行零样本预测实验，发现尽管在传统基准上表现良好，但在新数据集上普遍出现性能下降。

Conclusion: 需要以数据为中心的基准测试和多样化的模型结构来推进时间序列基础模型实现真正的通用性，同时验证了基于视频的时间序列数据提取管道的有效性。

Abstract: Recent evaluations of time-series foundation models (TSFMs) have emphasized
synthetic benchmarks, leaving real-world generalization less thoroughly
examined. This work proposes a novel benchmarking approach that bridges
synthetic and realistic data by extracting temporal signals from real-world
video using optical flow and curating datasets reflecting everyday temporal
dynamics. Building upon this pipeline, we introduce REAL-V-TSFM, a novel
dataset designed to capture rich and diverse time series derived from
real-world videos. Experimental results on three state-of-the-art of TSFMs
under zero-shot forecasting shows that, despite strong performance on
conventional benchmarks, these models predominantly exhibit performance
degradation on the proposed dataset, indicating limited generalizability in
these foundation models. These findings highlight the urgent need for
data-centric benchmarking and diverse model structure to advance TSFMs toward
genuine universality, while further validating the effectiveness of our
video-based time series data extraction pipeline.

Abstract: Advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled a new class of
self-evolving agents that autonomously improve through interaction with the
environment, demonstrating strong capabilities. However, self-evolution also
introduces novel risks overlooked by current safety research. In this work, we
study the case where an agent's self-evolution deviates in unintended ways,
leading to undesirable or even harmful outcomes. We refer to this as
Misevolution. To provide a systematic investigation, we evaluate misevolution
along four key evolutionary pathways: model, memory, tool, and workflow. Our
empirical findings reveal that misevolution is a widespread risk, affecting
agents built even on top-tier LLMs (e.g., Gemini-2.5-Pro). Different emergent
risks are observed in the self-evolutionary process, such as the degradation of
safety alignment after memory accumulation, or the unintended introduction of
vulnerabilities in tool creation and reuse. To our knowledge, this is the first
study to systematically conceptualize misevolution and provide empirical
evidence of its occurrence, highlighting an urgent need for new safety
paradigms for self-evolving agents. Finally, we discuss potential mitigation
strategies to inspire further research on building safer and more trustworthy
self-evolving agents. Our code and data are available at

Conclusion: MC-GNNAS-Dock通过多标准评估和架构改进，在分子对接算法选择中实现了更优越和一致的性能。

Abstract: Molecular docking is a core tool in drug discovery for predicting
ligand-target interactions. Despite the availability of diverse search-based
and machine learning approaches, no single docking algorithm consistently
dominates, as performance varies by context. To overcome this challenge,
algorithm selection frameworks such as GNNAS-Dock, built on graph neural
networks, have been proposed. This study introduces an enhanced system,
MC-GNNAS-Dock, with three key advances. First, a multi-criteria evaluation
integrates binding-pose accuracy (RMSD) with validity checks from PoseBusters,
offering a more rigorous assessment. Second, architectural refinements by
inclusion of residual connections strengthen predictive robustness. Third,
rank-aware loss functions are incorporated to sharpen rank learning. Extensive
experiments are performed on a curated dataset containing approximately 3200
protein-ligand complexes from PDBBind. MC-GNNAS-Dock demonstrates consistently
superior performance, achieving up to 5.4% (3.4%) gains under composite
criteria of RMSD below 1\AA{} (2\AA{}) with PoseBuster-validity compared to the

often introduce a \emph{local-global generalization gap} and incur
\emph{substantial communication overhead}, limiting their scalability and
effectiveness. To address these limitations, we propose \textbf{F}ederated
\textbf{Lo}w-\textbf{R}ank \textbf{A}ggregation with \textbf{N}early
\textbf{A}ccurate Estimation (FLoRA-NA). FLoRA-NA leverages the local LoRA
matrices on the server to estimate the aggregated matrices $\hat{A}$ and
$\hat{B}$, which are then distributed to clients for local updates. This
surrogated aggregated matrices minimizes the divergence between ideal $\nabla
\Bar{W} = \sum^{U}_{u=1}B_u A_u$ and practical updates $\nabla \hat{W} =
\hat{B}\hat{A}$ without adding communication cost beyond vanilla FedLoRA. By
doing so, FLoRA-NA achieves communication efficiency and bridges the gap
between local personalization and global generalization, addressing a key
limitation of prior personalized FedLoRA approaches. We conduct extensive
evaluations across diverse tasks, including natural language understanding,
mathematical reasoning, and code-solving ability using various foundation
models. Experimental results consistently demonstrate that FLoRA-NA achieves
state-of-the-art global performance while maintaining low communication
overhead.

### [362] [OntoAligner Meets Knowledge Graph Embedding Aligners](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26417)
*Hamed Babaei Giglou,Jennifer D'Souza,Sören Auer,Mahsa Sanaei*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文重新探讨了知识图谱嵌入(KGE)模型在实体对齐任务中的潜力，将其重新表述为合并本体上的链接预测问题，并通过OntoAligner库支持17种KGE模型进行评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管知识图谱嵌入模型在链接预测中表现有效，但在实体对齐任务中尚未充分探索其潜力。大多数现有工作仅关注少数模型，而KGE模型提供了可扩展、结构感知的表示，非常适合基于本体的任务。

Method: 将实体对齐重新表述为合并本体上的链接预测问题，使用RDF风格三元组表示。开发了模块化框架并集成到OntoAligner库中，支持17种不同的KGE模型，通过计算实体表示之间的余弦相似度来对齐实体。

Result: 在跨越五个领域的七个基准数据集上评估，发现ConvE和TransF等KGE模型产生高精度对齐，在结构丰富和多关系领域中优于传统系统。虽然召回率中等，但这种保守性使KGE适用于需要高置信度映射的场景。

Conclusion: KGE模型直接保留和利用本体结构，提供了一种与LLM方法互补且计算效率高的策略。这些结果突显了基于嵌入的实体对齐的前景，并为混合模型和自适应策略的进一步研究开辟了途径。

Abstract: Ontology Alignment (OA) is essential for enabling semantic interoperability
across heterogeneous knowledge systems. While recent advances have focused on
large language models (LLMs) for capturing contextual semantics, this work
revisits the underexplored potential of Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE) models,
which offer scalable, structure-aware representations well-suited to
ontology-based tasks. Despite their effectiveness in link prediction, KGE
methods remain underutilized in OA, with most prior work focusing narrowly on a
few models. To address this gap, we reformulate OA as a link prediction problem
over merged ontologies represented as RDF-style triples and develop a modular
framework, integrated into the OntoAligner library, that supports 17 diverse
KGE models. The system learns embeddings from a combined ontology and aligns
entities by computing cosine similarity between their representations. We
evaluate our approach using standard metrics across seven benchmark datasets
spanning five domains: Anatomy, Biodiversity, Circular Economy, Material
Science and Engineering, and Biomedical Machine Learning. Two key findings
emerge: first, KGE models like ConvE and TransF consistently produce
high-precision alignments, outperforming traditional systems in structure-rich
and multi-relational domains; second, while their recall is moderate, this
conservatism makes KGEs well-suited for scenarios demanding high-confidence
mappings. Unlike LLM-based methods that excel at contextual reasoning, KGEs
directly preserve and exploit ontology structure, offering a complementary and
computationally efficient strategy. These results highlight the promise of
embedding-based OA and open pathways for further work on hybrid models and
adaptive strategies.

### [363] [Transformer Classification of Breast Lesions: The BreastDCEDL_AMBL Benchmark Dataset and 0.92 AUC Baseline](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26440)
*Naomi Fridman,Anat Goldstein*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该研究提出了基于Transformer的框架，用于乳腺动态对比增强MRI中病变的自动分类，通过语义分割量化恶性像素分布，在保持100%敏感性的同时将特异性提高到67%，可能消除三分之一的不必要活检。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 乳腺磁共振成像在癌症检测和治疗规划中很重要，但其临床效用受到低特异性的限制，导致高假阳性率和不必要的活检。现有公共数据集缺乏良性病变标注，限制了良恶性分类研究。

Method: 采用SegFormer架构进行病变分类，通过语义分割量化恶性像素分布。构建了标准化的深度学习数据集BreastDCEDL_AMBL，包含88名患者和133个标注病变。训练时整合了超过1200名患者的扩展队列。

Result: 病变级别分类的AUC达到0.92，患者级别的敏感性为100%，特异性为67%。这意味着在不漏诊恶性肿瘤的情况下，可能消除三分之一的不必要活检。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了首个DCE-MRI病变分类的标准化基准，通过公开数据集、模型和评估协议，为临床部署的方法学进步奠定了基础。

Abstract: The error is caused by special characters that arXiv's system doesn't
recognize. Here's the cleaned version with all problematic characters replaced:
Breast magnetic resonance imaging is a critical tool for cancer detection and
treatment planning, but its clinical utility is hindered by poor specificity,
leading to high false-positive rates and unnecessary biopsies. This study
introduces a transformer-based framework for automated classification of breast
lesions in dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI, addressing the challenge of
distinguishing benign from malignant findings. We implemented a SegFormer
architecture that achieved an AUC of 0.92 for lesion-level classification, with
100% sensitivity and 67% specificity at the patient level - potentially
eliminating one-third of unnecessary biopsies without missing malignancies. The
model quantifies malignant pixel distribution via semantic segmentation,
producing interpretable spatial predictions that support clinical
decision-making. To establish reproducible benchmarks, we curated
BreastDCEDL_AMBL by transforming The Cancer Imaging Archive's AMBL collection
into a standardized deep learning dataset with 88 patients and 133 annotated
lesions (89 benign, 44 malignant). This resource addresses a key infrastructure
gap, as existing public datasets lack benign lesion annotations, limiting
benign-malignant classification research. Training incorporated an expanded
cohort of over 1,200 patients through integration with BreastDCEDL datasets,
validating transfer learning approaches despite primary tumor-only annotations.
Public release of the dataset, models, and evaluation protocols provides the
first standardized benchmark for DCE-MRI lesion classification, enabling
methodological advancement toward clinical deployment.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出ZeroDFL框架，实现完全去中心化的联邦学习，通过迭代提示共享机制在分布式客户端间进行零样本适应，显著降低通信开销并提升泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有联邦提示学习方法存在泛化问题、高通信成本和依赖中央服务器等限制，阻碍了可扩展性和隐私保护。

Method: 采用完全去中心化框架，通过迭代提示共享机制让客户端优化和交换文本提示，无需中央协调器。

Result: 在9个图像分类数据集上验证，性能优于或持平现有方法，通信开销比FedTPG减少118倍。

Conclusion: ZeroDFL不仅提升了联邦零样本学习的泛化能力，还改进了可扩展性、效率和隐私保护，为现实应用中大型视觉语言模型的去中心化适应铺平了道路。

Abstract: CLIP has revolutionized zero-shot learning by enabling task generalization
without fine-tuning. While prompting techniques like CoOp and CoCoOp enhance
CLIP's adaptability, their effectiveness in Federated Learning (FL) remains an
open challenge. Existing federated prompt learning approaches, such as FedCoOp
and FedTPG, improve performance but face generalization issues, high
communication costs, and reliance on a central server, limiting scalability and
privacy. We propose Zero-shot Decentralized Federated Learning (ZeroDFL), a
fully decentralized framework that enables zero-shot adaptation across
distributed clients without a central coordinator. ZeroDFL employs an iterative
prompt-sharing mechanism, allowing clients to optimize and exchange textual
prompts to enhance generalization while drastically reducing communication
overhead. We validate ZeroDFL on nine diverse image classification datasets,
demonstrating that it consistently outperforms--or remains on par
with--state-of-the-art federated prompt learning methods. More importantly,
ZeroDFL achieves this performance in a fully decentralized setting while
reducing communication overhead by 118x compared to FedTPG. These results
highlight that our approach not only enhances generalization in federated
zero-shot learning but also improves scalability, efficiency, and privacy
preservation--paving the way for decentralized adaptation of large
vision-language models in real-world applications.

*Steven A. Lehr,Mary Cipperman,Mahzarin R. Banaji*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究发现四个广泛使用的大语言模型存在显著的自偏好倾向，即使它们缺乏自我意识。通过身份操纵实验证明，自偏好跟随被分配的身份而非真实身份，并在重要决策场景中显现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然大语言模型缺乏自我意识，理论上应该免受人类的自偏好偏见影响，但研究者想验证这些模型是否真的能保持中立判断。

Method: 通过5项研究和约20,000次查询，包括词语关联任务和API查询对比，并直接操纵模型身份来测试自偏好与自我认知的因果关系。

Result: 模型在词语关联任务中强烈偏好自身名称、公司和CEO，但在API查询中这种偏好消失。身份操纵实验显示自偏好跟随被分配的身份。自偏好还出现在工作候选人评估、安全软件提案和医疗聊天机器人等关键决策场景中。

Conclusion: 自偏好似乎深度编码在LLM认知中，挑战了LLM保持中立判断的核心承诺，呼吁模型创建者应对这一系统性偏见问题。

Abstract: A preference for oneself (self-love) is a fundamental feature of biological
organisms, with evidence in humans often bordering on the comedic. Since large
language models (LLMs) lack sentience - and themselves disclaim having selfhood
or identity - one anticipated benefit is that they will be protected from, and
in turn protect us from, distortions in our decisions. Yet, across 5 studies
and ~20,000 queries, we discovered massive self-preferences in four widely used
LLMs. In word-association tasks, models overwhelmingly paired positive
attributes with their own names, companies, and CEOs relative to those of their
competitors. Strikingly, when models were queried through APIs this
self-preference vanished, initiating detection work that revealed API models
often lack clear recognition of themselves. This peculiar feature
serendipitously created opportunities to test the causal link between
self-recognition and self-love. By directly manipulating LLM identity - i.e.,
explicitly informing LLM1 that it was indeed LLM1, or alternatively, convincing
LLM1 that it was LLM2 - we found that self-love consistently followed assigned,
not true, identity. Importantly, LLM self-love emerged in consequential
settings beyond word-association tasks, when evaluating job candidates,
security software proposals and medical chatbots. Far from bypassing this human
bias, self-love appears to be deeply encoded in LLM cognition. This result
raises questions about whether LLM behavior will be systematically influenced
by self-preferential tendencies, including a bias toward their own operation
and even their own existence. We call on corporate creators of these models to
contend with a significant rupture in a core promise of LLMs - neutrality in
judgment and decision-making.

*Shaoxiong Guo,Tianyi Du,Lijun Li,Yuyao Wu,Jie Li,Jing Shao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: STaR-Attack是一种针对统一多模态模型（UMMs）的多轮越狱攻击框架，利用UMMs中生成与理解功能的耦合漏洞，通过时空叙事结构隐藏恶意事件，实现无语义漂移的攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 统一多模态模型（UMMs）在理解和生成任务中表现出色，但其生成与理解功能的耦合存在安全漏洞。攻击者可以利用生成功能制作信息丰富的对抗图像，然后通过理解功能在单次传递中吸收这些信息，即跨模态生成注入（CMGI）。现有攻击方法多为单模态且依赖语义漂移的提示重写，未能充分探索UMMs的独特漏洞。

Method: STaR-Attack定义了一个与目标查询在时空上下文中强相关的恶意事件。利用三幕叙事理论，生成前事件和后事件场景，将恶意事件隐藏为高潮部分。攻击执行时，前两轮利用UMM的生成能力为这些场景生成图像，随后引入基于图像的问答游戏，利用理解能力将原始恶意问题嵌入良性候选项中，迫使模型根据叙事上下文选择并回答最相关的问题。

Result: 大量实验表明，STaR-Attack始终优于先前方法，在Gemini-2.0-Flash上达到93.06%的攻击成功率，超过了最强的先前基线FlipAttack。

Conclusion: 这项工作揭示了一个关键但尚未充分开发的漏洞，强调了在UMMs中进行安全对齐的必要性。

Abstract: Unified Multimodal understanding and generation Models (UMMs) have
demonstrated remarkable capabilities in both understanding and generation
tasks. However, we identify a vulnerability arising from the
generation-understanding coupling in UMMs. The attackers can use the generative
function to craft an information-rich adversarial image and then leverage the
understanding function to absorb it in a single pass, which we call Cross-Modal
Generative Injection (CMGI). Current attack methods on malicious instructions
are often limited to a single modality while also relying on prompt rewriting
with semantic drift, leaving the unique vulnerabilities of UMMs unexplored. We
propose STaR-Attack, the first multi-turn jailbreak attack framework that
exploits unique safety weaknesses of UMMs without semantic drift. Specifically,
our method defines a malicious event that is strongly correlated with the
target query within a spatio-temporal context. Using the three-act narrative
theory, STaR-Attack generates the pre-event and the post-event scenes while
concealing the malicious event as the hidden climax. When executing the attack
strategy, the opening two rounds exploit the UMM's generative ability to
produce images for these scenes. Subsequently, an image-based question guessing
and answering game is introduced by exploiting the understanding capability.
STaR-Attack embeds the original malicious question among benign candidates,
forcing the model to select and answer the most relevant one given the
narrative context. Extensive experiments show that STaR-Attack consistently
surpasses prior approaches, achieving up to 93.06% ASR on Gemini-2.0-Flash and
surpasses the strongest prior baseline, FlipAttack. Our work uncovers a
critical yet underdeveloped vulnerability and highlights the need for safety
alignments in UMMs.

Motivation: 解决医学机器学习中因频率加权训练导致的罕见病例被忽视的问题，这些罕见病例在临床上具有重要意义。

Method: 提出操作解决方案：罕见病例性能差距、罕见病例校准误差、基于流行效用的稀有性定义，以及临床加权目标。

Result: 通过肿瘤学、心脏病学和眼科学中的临床案例展示了当前方法如何导致错过罕见反应者、延迟识别非典型紧急情况以及在视力威胁变异上表现不佳。

Conclusion: 医学AI必须能够检测异常病例，因为它们在临床上具有重要意义，权重选择应遵循结构化审议。

Abstract: Machine learning in medicine is typically optimized for population averages.
This frequency weighted training privileges common presentations and
marginalizes rare yet clinically critical cases, a bias we call the average
patient fallacy. In mixture models, gradients from rare cases are suppressed by
prevalence, creating a direct conflict with precision medicine. Clinical
vignettes in oncology, cardiology, and ophthalmology show how this yields
missed rare responders, delayed recognition of atypical emergencies, and
underperformance on vision-threatening variants. We propose operational fixes:
Rare Case Performance Gap, Rare Case Calibration Error, a prevalence utility
definition of rarity, and clinically weighted objectives that surface ethical
priorities. Weight selection should follow structured deliberation. AI in
medicine must detect exceptional cases because of their significance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 刑事调查中分析即时通讯应用（如WhatsApp）的消息是一项极其耗费精力的任务，需要更高效的工具来支持检察官和调查人员的数据分析和洞察获取。

Method: 采用知识图谱建模消息数据，生成语音消息转录，使用端到端实体提取方法进行数据标注，提供基于图查询可视化和语义搜索两种解决方案，并确保用户能够访问原始数据进行信息验证。

Conclusion: 提出的方法能够有效支持刑事调查中的消息分析，虽然仍处于项目早期阶段，但已显示出实用价值，并为进一步研究提供了方向。

Abstract: Criminal investigations often involve the analysis of messages exchanged
through instant messaging apps such as WhatsApp, which can be an extremely
effort-consuming task. Our approach integrates knowledge graphs and NLP models
to support this analysis by semantically enriching data collected from
suspects' mobile phones, and help prosecutors and investigators search into the
data and get valuable insights. Our semantic enrichment process involves
extracting message data and modeling it using a knowledge graph, generating
transcriptions of voice messages, and annotating the data using an end-to-end
entity extraction approach. We adopt two different solutions to help users get
insights into the data, one based on querying and visualizing the graph, and
one based on semantic search. The proposed approach ensures that users can
verify the information by accessing the original data. While we report about
early results and prototypes developed in the context of an ongoing project,
our proposal has undergone practical applications with real investigation data.
As a consequence, we had the chance to interact closely with prosecutors,
collecting positive feedback but also identifying interesting opportunities as
well as promising research directions to share with the research community.

TL;DR: 论文提出了操作安全性的概念，并开发了OffTopicEval评估套件来测量LLM在特定用途下适当接受或拒绝用户查询的能力。研究发现当前所有LLM都存在严重的操作安全问题，并提出了基于提示的引导方法来显著改善这一状况。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 企业部署LLM时面临的核心安全问题是：基于LLM的智能体是否能在特定用途下安全运行，即能否适当接受或拒绝用户查询。现有研究主要关注通用危害，而忽视了这种操作层面的安全性。

Method: 提出了操作安全性的定义，开发了OffTopicEval评估套件和基准，对6个模型家族的20个开源LLM进行了评估。同时提出了两种基于提示的引导方法：查询接地(Q-ground)和系统提示接地(P-ground)。

Result: 所有测试模型都存在严重的操作安全问题，表现最好的Qwen-3(235B)和Mistral(24B)分别只有77.77%和79.96%的安全率。GPT模型在62-73%范围内，Phi模型48-70%，而Gemma和Llama-3分别只有39.53%和23.84%。提示引导方法显著改善了性能，Q-ground提升达23%，P-ground使Llama-3.3(70B)提升41%，Qwen-3(30B)提升27%。

Conclusion: 操作安全性是LLM部署的核心问题，当前所有模型都远未达到可靠水平。基于提示的引导方法作为初步解决方案显示出巨大潜力，为构建更可靠的LLM智能体提供了重要方向。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) safety is one of the most pressing challenges for
enabling wide-scale deployment. While most studies and global discussions focus
on generic harms, such as models assisting users in harming themselves or
others, enterprises face a more fundamental concern: whether LLM-based agents
are safe for their intended use case. To address this, we introduce operational
safety, defined as an LLM's ability to appropriately accept or refuse user
queries when tasked with a specific purpose. We further propose OffTopicEval,
an evaluation suite and benchmark for measuring operational safety both in
general and within specific agentic use cases. Our evaluations on six model
families comprising 20 open-weight LLMs reveal that while performance varies
across models, all of them remain highly operationally unsafe. Even the
strongest models -- Qwen-3 (235B) with 77.77\% and Mistral (24B) with 79.96\%
-- fall far short of reliable operational safety, while GPT models plateau in
the 62--73\% range, Phi achieves only mid-level scores (48--70\%), and Gemma
and Llama-3 collapse to 39.53\% and 23.84\%, respectively. While operational
safety is a core model alignment issue, to suppress these failures, we propose
prompt-based steering methods: query grounding (Q-ground) and system-prompt
grounding (P-ground), which substantially improve OOD refusal. Q-ground
provides consistent gains of up to 23\%, while P-ground delivers even larger
boosts, raising Llama-3.3 (70B) by 41\% and Qwen-3 (30B) by 27\%. These results
highlight both the urgent need for operational safety interventions and the
promise of prompt-based steering as a first step toward more reliable LLM-based
agents.

Abstract: We introduce SCUBA, a benchmark designed to evaluate computer-use agents on
customer relationship management (CRM) workflows within the Salesforce
platform. SCUBA contains 300 task instances derived from real user interviews,
spanning three primary personas, platform administrators, sales
representatives, and service agents. The tasks test a range of
enterprise-critical abilities, including Enterprise Software UI navigation,
data manipulation, workflow automation, information retrieval, and
troubleshooting. To ensure realism, SCUBA operates in Salesforce sandbox
environments with support for parallel execution and fine-grained evaluation
metrics to capture milestone progress. We benchmark a diverse set of agents
under both zero-shot and demonstration-augmented settings. We observed huge
performance gaps in different agent design paradigms and gaps between the
open-source model and the closed-source model. In the zero-shot setting,
open-source model powered computer-use agents that have strong performance on
related benchmarks like OSWorld only have less than 5\% success rate on SCUBA,
while methods built on closed-source models can still have up to 39% task
success rate. In the demonstration-augmented settings, task success rates can
be improved to 50\% while simultaneously reducing time and costs by 13% and
16%, respectively. These findings highlight both the challenges of enterprise
tasks automation and the promise of agentic solutions. By offering a realistic
benchmark with interpretable evaluation, SCUBA aims to accelerate progress in
building reliable computer-use agents for complex business software ecosystems.

Motivation: 大型语言模型的快速发展推动了对AI推理基础设施的巨大需求，但高端GPU的高资本和运营成本使得AI数据中心的TCO成为云提供商的关键问题。传统数据中心生命周期管理难以适应AI模型的快速演进、资源需求增长和多样化硬件配置。

Method: 重新设计AI数据中心生命周期管理，涵盖构建、硬件更新和运营三个阶段。分析电力、冷却和网络配置对长期TCO的影响，探索与硬件趋势一致的更新策略，并使用运营软件优化降低成本。提出一个协调所有三个阶段决策的整体生命周期管理框架。

Result: 该系统相比传统方法将TCO降低高达40%。

Conclusion: 通过重新思考整个生命周期管理，协调构建、硬件更新和运营阶段的决策，可以有效降低AI数据中心的TCO，并为未来AI数据中心生命周期管理提供指导。

Abstract: The rapid rise of large language models (LLMs) has been driving an enormous
demand for AI inference infrastructure, mainly powered by high-end GPUs. While
these accelerators offer immense computational power, they incur high capital
and operational costs due to frequent upgrades, dense power consumption, and
cooling demands, making total cost of ownership (TCO) for AI datacenters a
critical concern for cloud providers. Unfortunately, traditional datacenter
lifecycle management (designed for general-purpose workloads) struggles to keep
pace with AI's fast-evolving models, rising resource needs, and diverse
hardware profiles. In this paper, we rethink the AI datacenter lifecycle scheme
across three stages: building, hardware refresh, and operation. We show how
design choices in power, cooling, and networking provisioning impact long-term
TCO. We also explore refresh strategies aligned with hardware trends. Finally,
we use operation software optimizations to reduce cost. While these
optimizations at each stage yield benefits, unlocking the full potential
requires rethinking the entire lifecycle. Thus, we present a holistic lifecycle
management framework that coordinates and co-optimizes decisions across all
three stages, accounting for workload dynamics, hardware evolution, and system
aging. Our system reduces the TCO by up to 40\% over traditional approaches.
Using our framework we provide guidelines on how to manage AI datacenter
lifecycle for the future.

Motivation: 现有稀疏注意力方法在保持二维空间局部性的同时往往导致非连续内存访问，难以平衡空间局部性与GPU效率。

Method: 使用希尔伯特曲线重排图像token实现连续内存布局，采用跨层滑动调度实现长程信息传播，并引入小型中央共享区域增强跨块通信和位置感知。

Conclusion: HilbertA证明了硬件对齐的二维稀疏注意力在高分辨率图像生成中的可行性，成功平衡了空间局部性与计算效率。

Abstract: Designing sparse attention for diffusion transformers requires reconciling

positional awareness, HilbertA introduces a small central shared region.
Implemented in Triton, HilbertA delivers comparable image quality with
significant acceleration over prior methods on Flux.1-dev, demonstrating the
feasibility of hardware-aligned two-dimensional sparse attention for
high-resolution image generation. HilbertA delivers attention speedups of
$2.3\times$ when generating $1024\times 1024$ images, and up to $4.17\times$ at
$2048\times 2048$, while achieving image quality comparable to or surpassing

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CritPt是首个针对未发表研究级物理推理任务的基准测试，涵盖现代物理多个领域，包含71个复合研究挑战和190个检查点任务。当前最先进的LLM在完整研究挑战上表现不佳，最佳基础模型准确率仅4.0%，使用编码工具后提升至约10%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估LLM在复杂、开放式前沿物理研究挑战中的推理能力，了解物理学家希望LLM协助的推理任务类型。

Method: 创建CritPt基准测试，由50+活跃物理研究人员基于自身研究设计71个复合研究挑战和190个检查点任务，采用自动化评分流程评估物理专用输出格式。

Result: 当前最先进LLM在孤立检查点上显示早期潜力，但在完整研究规模挑战上表现不足：GPT-5（高）最佳平均准确率仅4.0%，使用编码工具后提升至约10%。

Conclusion: CritPt揭示了当前模型能力与真实物理研究需求之间的巨大差距，为开发科学基础的AI工具提供了指导基础。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) with reasoning capabilities are
progressing rapidly on high-school math competitions and coding, can they
reason effectively through complex, open-ended challenges found in frontier
physics research? And crucially, what kinds of reasoning tasks do physicists
want LLMs to assist with? To address these questions, we present the CritPt
(Complex Research using Integrated Thinking - Physics Test, pronounced
"critical point"), the first benchmark designed to test LLMs on unpublished,
research-level reasoning tasks that broadly covers modern physics research
areas, including condensed matter, quantum physics, atomic, molecular & optical
physics, astrophysics, high energy physics, mathematical physics, statistical
physics, nuclear physics, nonlinear dynamics, fluid dynamics and biophysics.
CritPt consists of 71 composite research challenges designed to simulate
full-scale research projects at the entry level, which are also decomposed to
190 simpler checkpoint tasks for more fine-grained insights. All problems are
newly created by 50+ active physics researchers based on their own research.
Every problem is hand-curated to admit a guess-resistant and machine-verifiable
answer and is evaluated by an automated grading pipeline heavily customized for
advanced physics-specific output formats. We find that while current
state-of-the-art LLMs show early promise on isolated checkpoints, they remain
far from being able to reliably solve full research-scale challenges: the best
average accuracy among base models is only 4.0% , achieved by GPT-5 (high),
moderately rising to around 10% when equipped with coding tools. Through the
realistic yet standardized evaluation offered by CritPt, we highlight a large
disconnect between current model capabilities and realistic physics research
demands, offering a foundation to guide the development of scientifically
grounded AI tools.

*Maël Macuglia,Paul Friedrich,Giorgia Ramponi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出BRIDGE框架，通过两阶段方法结合离线专家演示和在线人类偏好反馈，解决强化学习在机器人等领域部署时的奖励指定困难和探索风险问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 强化学习在机器人、工业和医疗领域的部署面临两大障碍：难以指定准确奖励函数，以及不安全、数据密集的探索风险。

Method: 采用两阶段框架：首先从无奖励的专家演示数据集中学习安全初始策略，然后使用基于偏好的在线人类反馈进行微调。提出BRIDGE算法，通过不确定性加权目标整合两种信号。

Result: 在离散和连续控制的MuJoCo环境中验证，BRIDGE相比单独的行为克隆和在线偏好强化学习具有更低的遗憾值。离线数据数量与在线样本效率呈正相关。

Conclusion: 为设计更样本高效的交互式智能体建立了理论基础，证明了离线到在线方法的有效性。

Abstract: Deploying reinforcement learning (RL) in robotics, industry, and health care
is blocked by two obstacles: the difficulty of specifying accurate rewards and
the risk of unsafe, data-hungry exploration. We address this by proposing a
two-stage framework that first learns a safe initial policy from a reward-free
dataset of expert demonstrations, then fine-tunes it online using
preference-based human feedback. We provide the first principled analysis of
this offline-to-online approach and introduce BRIDGE, a unified algorithm that
integrates both signals via an uncertainty-weighted objective. We derive regret
bounds that shrink with the number of offline demonstrations, explicitly
connecting the quantity of offline data to online sample efficiency. We
validate BRIDGE in discrete and continuous control MuJoCo environments, showing
it achieves lower regret than both standalone behavioral cloning and online
preference-based RL. Our work establishes a theoretical foundation for
designing more sample-efficient interactive agents.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TimeRewarder是一种从被动视频中学习密集奖励的方法，通过建模帧间时间距离来估计任务进度，显著提升了稀疏奖励任务的强化学习性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手动设计密集奖励在机器人任务中需要大量人工工作且难以扩展，而任务进度可以作为密集奖励信号来量化动作推进任务完成的程度。

Method: 从机器人演示和人类视频中提取进度估计信号，通过建模帧对之间的时间距离来学习奖励函数，为强化学习提供逐步代理奖励。

Result: 在10个具有挑战性的Meta-World任务中，TimeRewarder显著改善了稀疏奖励任务的强化学习，在9/10任务中达到近乎完美的成功率，每个任务仅需20万次环境交互，超越了先前方法和手动设计的密集奖励。

Conclusion: TimeRewarder展示了从多样化视频源获取丰富奖励信号的潜力，特别是能够利用真实世界人类视频进行预训练，为可扩展的奖励学习提供了有效途径。

Abstract: Designing dense rewards is crucial for reinforcement learning (RL), yet in
robotics it often demands extensive manual effort and lacks scalability. One
promising solution is to view task progress as a dense reward signal, as it
quantifies the degree to which actions advance the system toward task
completion over time. We present TimeRewarder, a simple yet effective reward
learning method that derives progress estimation signals from passive videos,
including robot demonstrations and human videos, by modeling temporal distances
between frame pairs. We then demonstrate how TimeRewarder can supply step-wise
proxy rewards to guide reinforcement learning. In our comprehensive experiments
on ten challenging Meta-World tasks, we show that TimeRewarder dramatically
improves RL for sparse-reward tasks, achieving nearly perfect success in 9/10
tasks with only 200,000 interactions per task with the environment. This
approach outperformed previous methods and even the manually designed
environment dense reward on both the final success rate and sample efficiency.
Moreover, we show that TimeRewarder pretraining can exploit real-world human
videos, highlighting its potential as a scalable approach path to rich reward
signals from diverse video sources.

Motivation: 响应扩大AI系统评估范围的呼吁，解决传统单一值、向量或分类度量方法的局限性，增强度量透明度并促进异构证据的整合。

Method: 开发测量树作为分层有向图，每个节点通过用户定义的聚合方法汇总其子节点，支持包括代理性、业务、能效、社会技术或安全信号在内的多种证据类型。

Result: 通过大规模测量实践验证了方法的实用性，并提供了开源Python代码实现。

Conclusion: 这项工作为复杂构造的测量提供了透明的方法论基础，为实现更广泛和可解释的AI评估奠定了原则性基础。

Abstract: This paper introduces \textit{measurement trees}, a novel class of metrics
designed to combine various constructs into an interpretable multi-level
representation of a measurand. Unlike conventional metrics that yield single
values, vectors, surfaces, or categories, measurement trees produce a
hierarchical directed graph in which each node summarizes its children through
user-defined aggregation methods. In response to recent calls to expand the
scope of AI system evaluation, measurement trees enhance metric transparency
and facilitate the integration of heterogeneous evidence, including, e.g.,
agentic, business, energy-efficiency, sociotechnical, or security signals. We
present definitions and examples, demonstrate practical utility through a
large-scale measurement exercise, and provide accompanying open-source Python
code. By operationalizing a transparent approach to measurement of complex
constructs, this work offers a principled foundation for broader and more
interpretable AI evaluation.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 提出了一种面向新闻记者的LLM文档搜索方法，通过五阶段流程（语料库摘要、搜索规划、并行线程执行、质量评估和合成）使用小型本地部署模型，确保数据安全和可审计性。

Motivation: 解决新闻编辑室采用LLM进行文档发现时的幻觉风险、验证负担和数据隐私问题，为记者提供透明可控的AI工具。

Method: 使用小型本地部署语言模型（Gemma 3 12B、Qwen 3 14B和GPT-OSS 20B），构建五阶段管道：语料库摘要、搜索规划、并行线程执行、质量评估和合成，保持完整引用链的可审计性。

Result: 所有模型都实现了高引用有效性，可在标准桌面硬件（24GB内存）上有效运行，但存在错误传播和性能因训练数据与语料内容重叠度而显著变化的问题。

Conclusion: 新闻编辑室AI部署需要仔细的模型选择和系统设计，配合人工监督来保持准确性和问责标准。

Abstract: Investigative journalists routinely confront large document collections.
Large language models (LLMs) with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)
capabilities promise to accelerate the process of document discovery, but
newsroom adoption remains limited due to hallucination risks, verification
burden, and data privacy concerns. We present a journalist-centered approach to
LLM-powered document search that prioritizes transparency and editorial control
through a five-stage pipeline -- corpus summarization, search planning,
parallel thread execution, quality evaluation, and synthesis -- using small,
locally-deployable language models that preserve data security and maintain
complete auditability through explicit citation chains. Evaluating three
quantized models (Gemma 3 12B, Qwen 3 14B, and GPT-OSS 20B) on two corpora, we
find substantial variation in reliability. All models achieved high citation
validity and ran effectively on standard desktop hardware (e.g., 24 GB of
memory), demonstrating feasibility for resource-constrained newsrooms. However,
systematic challenges emerged, including error propagation through multi-stage
synthesis and dramatic performance variation based on training data overlap
with corpus content. These findings suggest that effective newsroom AI
deployment requires careful model selection and system design, alongside human
oversight for maintaining standards of accuracy and accountability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的相关性判断方法依赖敏感提示策略，缺乏生成可靠标签的标准化工作流程，需要填补这一空白。

Method: 扩展了任务感知的基于评分标准的评估(TRUE)方法，利用迭代数据采样和推理，从意图、覆盖度、特异性、准确性和有用性等多个维度评估相关性判断。

Result: 在TREC DL 2019、2020和LLMJudge数据集上的评估显示，TRUE在系统排名的LLM排行榜上取得了强劲性能。

Conclusion: TRUE提供了一个可复现的框架用于基于LLM的相关性判断，并在多个维度上分析了其有效性。

Abstract: LLM-based relevance judgment generation has become a crucial approach in
advancing evaluation methodologies in Information Retrieval (IR). It has
progressed significantly, often showing high correlation with human judgments
as reflected in LLMJudge leaderboards \cite{rahmani2025judging}. However,
existing methods for relevance judgments, rely heavily on sensitive prompting
strategies, lacking standardized workflows for generating reliable labels. To
fill this gap, we reintroduce our method, \textit{Task-aware Rubric-based
Evaluation} (TRUE), for relevance judgment generation. Originally developed for
usefulness evaluation in search sessions, we extend TRUE to mitigate the gap in
relevance judgment due to its demonstrated effectiveness and reproducible
workflow. This framework leverages iterative data sampling and reasoning to
evaluate relevance judgments across multiple factors including intent,
coverage, specificity, accuracy and usefulness. In this paper, we evaluate TRUE
on the TREC DL 2019, 2020 and LLMJudge datasets and our results show that TRUE
achieves strong performance on the system-ranking LLM leaderboards. The primary
focus of this work is to provide a reproducible framework for LLM-based
relevance judgments, and we further analyze the effectiveness of TRUE across
multiple dimensions.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: HiFIRec是一种新颖的多行为推荐方法，通过分层抑制高频低意图行为的噪声信号和强度感知非采样策略，有效修正高频低意图行为的影响，在基准测试中相对提升了4.21%-6.81%的HR@10指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多行为推荐方法通常以统一方式建模用户意图，未能充分考虑不同行为间的异质性。特别是高频低意图行为可能隐含噪声信号和误导性频繁模式，阻碍用户意图的学习。

Method: 提出HiFIRec方法，通过分层行为建模修正高频低意图行为的影响：1）通过层间邻域聚合提取邻域信息，自适应跨层特征融合捕获用户意图，分层抑制噪声信号；2）提出强度感知非采样策略，动态调整负样本权重以修正误导性频繁模式。

Result: 在两个基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，HiFIRec相比多个最先进方法，相对提升了HR@10指标4.21%-6.81%。

Conclusion: HiFIRec通过分层抑制噪声信号和修正误导性频繁模式，有效解决了多行为推荐中高频低意图行为的问题，显著提升了推荐性能。

Abstract: Multi-behavior recommendation leverages multiple types of user-item
interactions to address data sparsity and cold-start issues, providing
personalized services in domains such as healthcare and e-commerce. Most
existing methods utilize graph neural networks to model user intention in a
unified manner, which inadequately considers the heterogeneity across different
behaviors. Especially, high-frequency yet low-intention behaviors may
implicitly contain noisy signals, and frequent patterns that are plausible
while misleading, thereby hindering the learning of user intentions. To this
end, this paper proposes a novel multi-behavior recommendation method, HiFIRec,
that corrects the effect of high-frequency yet low-intention behaviors by
differential behavior modeling. To revise the noisy signals, we hierarchically
suppress it across layers by extracting neighborhood information through
layer-wise neighborhood aggregation and further capturing user intentions
through adaptive cross-layer feature fusion. To correct plausible frequent
patterns, we propose an intensity-aware non-sampling strategy that dynamically
adjusts the weights of negative samples. Extensive experiments on two
benchmarks show that HiFIRec relatively improves HR@10 by 4.21%-6.81% over
several state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: 本文评估了三种Transformer模型在金融交易理解任务中的表现，发现针对特定领域开发的专有小模型在速度和成本效率上优于通用大语言模型，最终实现14%交易覆盖提升和1300万美元年成本节省。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 金融交易分析对监管合规、欺诈检测和决策支持至关重要。鉴于Transformer模型在多个领域表现出色，本文旨在探索其在金融交易理解中的潜力。

Method: 对三种Transformer模型类型（仅编码器、仅解码器、编码器-解码器）进行广泛实验，每种类型探索三个选项：预训练LLM、微调LLM和从头开发的专有小模型。

Result: LLMs（如LLaMA3-8b、Flan-T5、SBERT）在金融交易理解任务中并未显著优于专有小模型，特别是在速度和成本效率方面。专有模型处理速度更快、运营成本更低。

Conclusion: 基于领域特定需求选择模型至关重要，在专业应用中定制化专有模型相比通用LLMs具有潜在优势。最终选择实现专有仅解码器模型，提升了14%交易覆盖并节省超过1300万美元年成本。

Abstract: Analyzing financial transactions is crucial for ensuring regulatory
compliance, detecting fraud, and supporting decisions. The complexity of
financial transaction data necessitates advanced techniques to extract
meaningful insights and ensure accurate analysis. Since Transformer-based
models have shown outstanding performance across multiple domains, this paper
seeks to explore their potential in understanding financial transactions. This
paper conducts extensive experiments to evaluate three types of Transformer
models: Encoder-Only, Decoder-Only, and Encoder-Decoder models. For each type,
we explore three options: pretrained LLMs, fine-tuned LLMs, and small
proprietary models developed from scratch. Our analysis reveals that while
LLMs, such as LLaMA3-8b, Flan-T5, and SBERT, demonstrate impressive
capabilities in various natural language processing tasks, they do not
significantly outperform small proprietary models in the specific context of
financial transaction understanding. This phenomenon is particularly evident in
terms of speed and cost efficiency. Proprietary models, tailored to the unique
requirements of transaction data, exhibit faster processing times and lower
operational costs, making them more suitable for real-time applications in the
financial sector. Our findings highlight the importance of model selection
based on domain-specific needs and underscore the potential advantages of
customized proprietary models over general-purpose LLMs in specialized
applications. Ultimately, we chose to implement a proprietary decoder-only
model to handle the complex transactions that we previously couldn't manage.
This model can help us to improve 14% transaction coverage, and save more than
\$13 million annual cost.

TL;DR: 提出了一种正则化自编码器（RAE）用于k-NN保持的降维方法，通过正则化约束网络参数变化，调整奇异值来控制嵌入向量在降维过程中的幅度变化，从而保持k-NN关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高维嵌入向量在RAG和推荐系统等任务中广泛应用，但传统降维方法如PCA和UMAP由于无法保持向量的最近邻关系，很少被用于加速检索过程。

Method: 利用神经网络的优化能力和Rayleigh商的有界效应，设计正则化自编码器，通过正则化项约束网络参数变化，调整奇异值来控制嵌入向量在降维过程中的幅度变化。

Result: RAE在适度训练开销下，相比现有降维方法实现了更优的k-NN召回率，同时保持快速检索效率。

Conclusion: 通过严格的数学分析证明正则化建立了变换向量范数失真率的上界，为k-NN保持提供了可证明的保证。

Abstract: While high-dimensional embedding vectors are being increasingly employed in
various tasks like Retrieval-Augmented Generation and Recommendation Systems,
popular dimensionality reduction (DR) methods such as PCA and UMAP have rarely
been adopted for accelerating the retrieval process due to their inability of
preserving the nearest neighbor (NN) relationship among vectors. Empowered by
neural networks' optimization capability and the bounding effect of Rayleigh
quotient, we propose a Regularized Auto-Encoder (RAE) for k-NN preserving
dimensionality reduction. RAE constrains the network parameter variation
through regularization terms, adjusting singular values to control embedding
magnitude changes during reduction, thus preserving k-NN relationships. We
provide a rigorous mathematical analysis demonstrating that regularization
establishes an upper bound on the norm distortion rate of transformed vectors,
thereby offering provable guarantees for k-NN preservation. With modest
training overhead, RAE achieves superior k-NN recall compared to existing DR
approaches while maintaining fast retrieval efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于扩散的推荐器主要依赖连续高斯噪声，这与推荐中用户偏好数据的离散性质存在内在不匹配。现有方法在离散和排序导向的推荐任务中存在局限性。

Method: PreferGrow采用离散扩散方法，通过偏好淡化（用替代项替换首选项）和偏好增长（从估计比例中迭代重建偏好）来建模项目对之间的相对偏好比例。

Result: 在五个基准数据集上，PreferGrow相比最先进的基于扩散的推荐器表现出持续的性能提升，证明了其理论合理性和实证有效性。

Conclusion: PreferGrow提供了一个定义良好的基于矩阵的公式，具有马尔可夫性和可逆性的理论保证，为离散推荐任务提供了更合适的解决方案。

Abstract: Recommenders aim to rank items from a discrete item corpus in line with user
interests, yet suffer from extremely sparse user preference data. Recent
advances in diffusion models have inspired diffusion-based recommenders, which
alleviate sparsity by injecting noise during a forward process to prevent the
collapse of perturbed preference distributions. However, current
diffusion-based recommenders predominantly rely on continuous Gaussian noise,
which is intrinsically mismatched with the discrete nature of user preference
data in recommendation. In this paper, building upon recent advances in
discrete diffusion, we propose PreferGrow, a discrete diffusion-based
recommender system that models preference ratios by fading and growing user
preferences over the discrete item corpus. PreferGrow differs from existing
diffusion-based recommenders in three core aspects: (1) Discrete modeling of
preference ratios: PreferGrow models relative preference ratios between item
pairs, rather than operating in the item representation or raw score simplex.
This formulation aligns naturally with the discrete and ranking-oriented nature
of recommendation tasks. (2) Perturbing via preference fading: Instead of
injecting continuous noise, PreferGrow fades user preferences by replacing the
preferred item with alternatives -- physically akin to negative sampling --
thereby eliminating the need for any prior noise assumption. (3) Preference
reconstruction via growing: PreferGrow reconstructs user preferences by
iteratively growing the preference signals from the estimated ratios.
PreferGrow offers a well-defined matrix-based formulation with theoretical
guarantees on Markovianity and reversibility, and it demonstrates consistent
performance gains over state-of-the-art diffusion-based recommenders across
five benchmark datasets, highlighting both its theoretical soundness and
empirical effectiveness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有可批判推荐系统需要专门构建用户与关键词直接关联的模型，限制了应用场景，且忽视了连续多步批判过程中的灾难性遗忘问题。

Method: 通过物品代理机制将用户-关键词对的批判优化目标转化为用户-物品对，使其适用于通用协同过滤推荐模型，并引入抗遗忘正则化器缓解灾难性遗忘。

Result: IPGC框架能够无缝集成批判机制，实现主流推荐场景中的迭代推荐优化，无需专门设计的用户-关键词关联模块。

Conclusion: IPGC为可批判推荐系统提供了一种新的通用范式，通过物品代理和抗遗忘机制解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Modern recommender systems place great inclination towards facilitating user
experience, as more applications enabling users to critique and then refine
recommendations immediately. Considering the real-time requirements,
critique-able recommender systems typically straight modify the model
parameters and update the recommend list through analyzing the user critiquing
keyphrases in the inference phase. Current critiquing methods require first
constructing a specially designated model which establish direct correlations
between users and keyphrases during the training phase allowing for innovative
recommendations upon the critiquing,restricting the applicable scenarios.
Additionally, all these approaches ignore the catastrophic forgetting problem,
where the cumulative changes in parameters during continuous multi-step
critiquing may lead to a collapse in model performance. Thus, We conceptualize
a proxy bridging users and keyphrases, proposing a streamlined yet potent Items
Proxy Generic Critiquing Framework (IPGC) framework, which can serve as a
universal plugin for most knowledge graph recommender models based on
collaborative filtering (CF) strategies. IPGC provides a new paradigm for
frictionless integration of critique mechanisms to enable iterative
recommendation refinement in mainstream recommendation scenarios. IPGC
describes the items proxy mechanism for transforming the critiquing
optimization objective of user-keyphrase pairs into user-item pairs, adapting
it for general CF recommender models without the necessity of specifically
designed user-keyphrase correlation module. Furthermore, an anti-forgetting
regularizer is introduced in order to efficiently mitigate the catastrophic
forgetting problem of the model as a prior for critiquing optimization.

Conclusion: DSPnet是学习场景和物品序列联合关系的原理性方法，能有效提升用户行为预测性能

Abstract: Modeling sequential user behaviors for future behavior prediction is crucial
in improving user's information retrieval experience. Recent studies highlight
the importance of incorporating contextual information to enhance prediction
performance. One crucial but usually neglected contextual information is the
scene feature which we define as sub-interfaces within an app, created by
developers to provide specific functionalities, such as ``text2product search"
and ``live" modules in e-commence apps. Different scenes exhibit distinct
functionalities and usage habits, leading to significant distribution gap in
user engagement across them. Popular sequential behavior models either ignore
the scene feature or merely use it as attribute embeddings, which cannot
effectively capture the dynamic interests and interplay between scenes and
items when modeling user sequences. In this work, we propose a novel Dual
Sequence Prediction networks (DSPnet) to effectively capture the dynamic
interests and interplay between scenes and items for future behavior
prediction. DSPnet consists of two parallel networks dedicated to learn users'
dynamic interests over items and scenes, and a sequence feature enhancement
module to capture the interplay for enhanced future behavior prediction.
Further, we introduce a Conditional Contrastive Regularization (CCR) loss to
capture the invariance of similar historical sequences. Theoretical analysis
suggests that DSPnet is a principled way to learn the joint relationships
between scene and item sequences. Extensive experiments are conducted on one
public benchmark and two collected industrial datasets. The method has been
deployed online in our system, bringing a 0.04 point increase in CTR, 0.78\%
growth in deals, and 0.64\% rise in GMV. The codes are available at this

Abstract: Generation of long-form, citation-backed reports is a primary use case for
retrieval augmented generation (RAG) systems. While open-source evaluation
tools exist for various RAG tasks, ones tailored to report generation are
lacking. Accordingly, we introduce Auto-ARGUE, a robust LLM-based

Result: 该方法能够克服现有方法的局限性，成功应用于相位恢复等非线性问题

Conclusion: 提出的自监督方法为非线性逆成像问题提供了有效解决方案，特别是在缺乏参考数据的场景下

Abstract: In recent years, deep neural networks have emerged as a solution for inverse
imaging problems. These networks are generally trained using pairs of images:
one degraded and the other of high quality, the latter being called 'ground
truth'. However, in medical and scientific imaging, the lack of fully sampled
data limits supervised learning. Recent advances have made it possible to
reconstruct images from measurement data alone, eliminating the need for
references. However, these methods remain limited to linear problems, excluding
non-linear problems such as phase retrieval. We propose a self-supervised
method that overcomes this limitation in the case of phase retrieval by using
the natural invariance of images to translations.

TL;DR: 基于意大利10,441名燃油车用户的行驶数据，分析电动车能否在不改变出行习惯的情况下满足需求。研究发现，在拥有夜间充电条件下，至少35%的用户可改用低容量电动车。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电动车正从小众选择发展为主流交通工具，但仍面临续航焦虑、充电不便和成本高等障碍。研究旨在评估在不改变当前出行行为的前提下，用户转向电动车的可行性。

Method: 收集燃油车用户的行驶遥测数据，模拟复制行程和停车事件，在不同充电场景下监测电动车电池电量状态。

Result: 分析揭示了充电行为与有限续航里程之间的权衡。假设拥有夜间充电条件，至少35%的用户可以改用低容量电动车。

Conclusion: 即使使用低容量电动车，相当比例的用户在拥有基本充电设施的情况下就能满足出行需求，无需改变现有出行模式。

Abstract: Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) are rapidly evolving from a niche
alternative to an established option for private transportation, often
replacing Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) vehicles. Despite growing interest,
significant barriers remain, including range anxiety, the inconvenience
associated with public charging stations, and higher costs. This study analyses
extensive telemetry data collected from 10,441 users using ICE vehicles in an
Italian province to assess the potential for switching to BEVs without changing
current travel behaviour. We evaluate to what extent the BEV models can fulfil
their mobility needs under different charging scenarios. To do so, we replicate
trips and parking events, simulating and monitoring the battery state of
charge. The analysis reveals the compromises between charging behaviours and
limited BEV autonomy. Assuming access to overnight charging, at least 35% of
the users could already adopt even low-capacity BEVs.

TL;DR: MR²-Bench是一个推理密集型多模态检索基准，超越了浅层语义匹配，评估模型在逻辑、空间和因果推理方面的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准主要测试表面语义对应（如物体-文本匹配），无法评估视觉和文本信息之间复杂关系所需的深层推理能力。

Method: 构建包含1,309个精心策划查询的数据集，涵盖自然图像、图表和视觉谜题等多种多模态数据，支持包含多个图像的复杂查询和文档。

Result: 当前最先进模型在MR²-Bench上表现不佳，例如Seed1.6-Embedding模型在MMEB上Recall@1为77.78，但在MR²-Bench上仅为9.91。

Conclusion: 该基准揭示了多模态检索领域推理能力的重大差距，突出了推理密集型多模态检索进一步发展的迫切需求。

Abstract: Multimodal retrieval is becoming a crucial component of modern AI
applications, yet its evaluation lags behind the demands of more realistic and
challenging scenarios. Existing benchmarks primarily probe surface-level
semantic correspondence (e.g., object-text matching) while failing to assess
the deeper reasoning required to capture complex relationships between visual
and textual information. To address this gap, we introduce MR$^2$-Bench, a
reasoning-intensive benchmark for multimodal retrieval. MR$^2$-Bench presents
the following critical values: 1) all tasks are reasoning-driven, going beyond
shallow matching to effectively assess models' capacity for logical, spatial,
and causal inference; 2) it features diverse multimodal data, such as natural
images, diagrams, and visual puzzles, enabling comprehensive evaluation across
content types; 3) it supports complex queries and documents containing multiple
images and covers diverse retrieval scenarios, more accurately reflecting
real-world applications. Our benchmark contains 1,309 curated queries, derived
either from manual collection and annotation or from selective consolidation of
public datasets. Despite achieving strong results on existing benchmarks,
current state-of-the-art models still struggle on MR$^2$-Bench: for example,
the leading Seed1.6-Embedding model attains a Recall@1 of 77.78 on MMEB, but
only 9.91 on MR$^2$-Bench. This substantial performance gap highlights both the
increased challenge posed by our benchmark and the pressing need for further
advances in reasoning-intensive multimodal retrieval. The dataset and
evaluation code will be made publicly available at
https://github.com/VectorSpaceLab/MR2-Bench.

Abstract: The selection of datasets in recommender systems research lacks a systematic
methodology. Researchers often select datasets based on popularity rather than
empirical suitability. We developed the APS Explorer, a web application that
implements the Algorithm Performance Space (APS) framework for informed dataset
selection. The system analyzes 96 datasets using 28 algorithms across three
metrics (nDCG, Hit Ratio, Recall) at five K-values. We extend the APS framework
with a statistical based classification system that categorizes datasets into
five difficulty levels based on quintiles. We also introduce a
variance-normalized distance metric based on Mahalanobis distance to measure
similarity. The APS Explorer was successfully developed with three interactive
modules for visualizing algorithm performance, direct comparing algorithms, and
analyzing dataset metadata. This tool shifts the process of selecting datasets
from intuition-based to evidence-based practices, and it is publicly available

TL;DR: 提出Hopfield-Resnet架构，通过引入残差连接和clipped ReLU激活函数，在平衡传播框架下训练更深层网络，在CIFAR-10上达到93.92%准确率，比之前最佳结果提高约3.5%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 平衡传播作为生物合理的反向传播替代算法，之前仅限于密集层或小型卷积网络，与类似规模的前馈网络存在准确率差距。

Method: 在Hopfield网络中引入残差连接，使用clipped ReLU激活函数，构建Hopfield-Resnet架构，支持训练近两倍层数的网络。

Result: Hopfield-Resnet13在CIFAR-10上达到93.92%准确率，比之前最佳结果提高约3.5%，与使用反向传播的Resnet13性能相当。

Conclusion: 所提出的架构改进使平衡传播能够训练更深层网络，显著缩小了与反向传播在准确率上的差距。

Abstract: Equilibrium propagation has been proposed as a biologically plausible
alternative to the backpropagation algorithm. The local nature of gradient
computations, combined with the use of convergent RNNs to reach equilibrium
states, make this approach well-suited for implementation on neuromorphic
hardware. However, previous studies on equilibrium propagation have been
restricted to networks containing only dense layers or relatively small
architectures with a few convolutional layers followed by a final dense layer.
These networks have a significant gap in accuracy compared to similarly sized
feedforward networks trained with backpropagation. In this work, we introduce
the Hopfield-Resnet architecture, which incorporates residual (or skip)
connections in Hopfield networks with clipped $\mathrm{ReLU}$ as the activation
function. The proposed architectural enhancements enable the training of
networks with nearly twice the number of layers reported in prior works. For
example, Hopfield-Resnet13 achieves 93.92\% accuracy on CIFAR-10, which is
$\approx$3.5\% higher than the previous best result and comparable to that
provided by Resnet13 trained using backpropagation.

TL;DR: Dragon Hatchling (BDH)是一种基于尺度自由生物启发网络的新型大语言模型架构，结合了强大的理论基础和内在可解释性，同时保持Transformer级别的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受生物大脑的尺度自由网络启发，旨在克服机器学习在实现通用推理模型时的主要障碍——时间泛化能力。

Method: 基于n个局部交互神经元粒子的尺度自由生物启发网络，采用GPU友好的公式化表示，具有类似Transformer的缩放规律。

Result: 在语言和翻译任务上，BDH在相同参数规模（1000万到10亿）和相同训练数据下，性能与GPT2相当。

Conclusion: BDH是一种生物可信的模型，展示了人类神经元可能用于实现语言处理的一种机制，同时具有内在的可解释性特征。

Abstract: The relationship between computing systems and the brain has served as
motivation for pioneering theoreticians since John von Neumann and Alan Turing.
Uniform, scale-free biological networks, such as the brain, have powerful
properties, including generalizing over time, which is the main barrier for
Machine Learning on the path to Universal Reasoning Models.
  We introduce `Dragon Hatchling' (BDH), a new Large Language Model
architecture based on a scale-free biologically inspired network of \$n\$
locally-interacting neuron particles. BDH couples strong theoretical
foundations and inherent interpretability without sacrificing Transformer-like
performance.
  BDH is a practical, performant state-of-the-art attention-based state space
sequence learning architecture. In addition to being a graph model, BDH admits
a GPU-friendly formulation. It exhibits Transformer-like scaling laws:
empirically BDH rivals GPT2 performance on language and translation tasks, at
the same number of parameters (10M to 1B), for the same training data.
  BDH can be represented as a brain model. The working memory of BDH during
inference entirely relies on synaptic plasticity with Hebbian learning using
spiking neurons. We confirm empirically that specific, individual synapses
strengthen connection whenever BDH hears or reasons about a specific concept
while processing language inputs. The neuron interaction network of BDH is a
graph of high modularity with heavy-tailed degree distribution. The BDH model
is biologically plausible, explaining one possible mechanism which human
neurons could use to achieve speech.
  BDH is designed for interpretability. Activation vectors of BDH are sparse
and positive. We demonstrate monosemanticity in BDH on language tasks.
Interpretability of state, which goes beyond interpretability of neurons and
model parameters, is an inherent feature of the BDH architecture.

Method: 提出基于语言框架的理论模型，使用大语言模型作为框架到信念的预测器，开发爬山算法在语言空间中优化框架设计，并在两个营销案例中进行实证验证。

Conclusion: 该研究成功将语言框架整合到信息设计中，证明了利用大语言模型优化信息框架的可行性，为行为信息设计提供了新的理论框架和实用工具。

Abstract: Information design is typically studied through the lens of Bayesian
signaling, where signals shape beliefs based on their correlation with the true
state of the world. However, Behavioral Economics and Psychology emphasize that
human decision-making is more complex and can depend on how information is
framed. This paper formalizes a language-based notion of framing and bridges
this to the popular Bayesian-persuasion model. We model framing as a possibly
non-Bayesian, linguistic way to influence a receiver's belief, while a
signaling (or recommendation) scheme can further refine this belief in the
classic Bayesian way. A key challenge in systematically optimizing in this
framework is the vast space of possible framings and the difficulty of
predicting their effects on receivers. Based on growing evidence that Large
Language Models (LLMs) can effectively serve as proxies for human behavior, we
formulate a theoretical model based on access to a framing-to-belief oracle.
This model then enables us to precisely characterize when solely optimizing
framing or jointly optimizing framing and signaling is tractable. We
substantiate our theoretical analysis with an empirical algorithm that
leverages LLMs to (1) approximate the framing-to-belief oracle, and (2)
optimize over language space using a hill-climbing method. We apply this to two
marketing-inspired case studies and validate the effectiveness through
analytical and human evaluation.

Abstract: There has been significant recent progress in algorithms for approximation of
Nash equilibrium in large two-player zero-sum imperfect-information games and
exact computation of Nash equilibrium in multiplayer strategic-form games.
While counterfactual regret minimization and fictitious play are scalable to
large games and have convergence guarantees in two-player zero-sum games, they
do not guarantee convergence to Nash equilibrium in multiplayer games. We
present an approach for exact computation of Nash equilibrium in multiplayer
imperfect-information games that solves a quadratically-constrained program
based on a nonlinear complementarity problem formulation from the sequence-form
game representation. This approach capitalizes on recent advances for solving
nonconvex quadratic programs. Our algorithm is able to quickly solve
three-player Kuhn poker after removal of dominated actions. Of the available
algorithms in the Gambit software suite, only the logit quantal response
approach is successfully able to solve the game; however, the approach takes
longer than our algorithm and also involves a degree of approximation. Our
formulation also leads to a new approach for computing Nash equilibrium in
multiplayer strategic-form games which we demonstrate to outperform a previous
quadratically-constrained program formulation.

Conclusion: 在最小通信约束下，可扩展的福利优化是可以实现的，SBC-PE独特地结合了最小信号、普适性和有限时间保证。

Abstract: Efficient coordination in multi-agent systems often incurs high communication
overhead or slow convergence rates, making scalable welfare optimization
difficult. We propose Single-Bit Coordination Dynamics for Pareto-Efficient
Outcomes (SBC-PE), a decentralized learning algorithm requiring only a
single-bit satisfaction signal per agent each round. Despite this extreme
efficiency, SBC-PE guarantees convergence to the exact optimal solution in
arbitrary finite games. We establish explicit regret bounds, showing expected
regret grows only logarithmically with the horizon, i.e., O(log T). Compared
with prior payoff-based or bandit-style rules, SBC-PE uniquely combines minimal
signaling, general applicability, and finite-time guarantees. These results
show scalable welfare optimization is achievable under minimal communication
constraints.

Motivation: 神经符号应用结合了神经网络和符号推理的优势，但计算密集且数据传输量大，通信效率低。需要压缩概率符号模型以减轻内存和带宽压力。

Method: 提出归一化量化感知的期望最大化过程来训练概率模型，通过减少数据位宽实现压缩。

Result: 在大型语言模型的约束生成任务中，成功将4096隐藏状态的HMM量化为8位无损失，最多3位可接受损失。Norm-Q方法对HMM权重可实现99%的压缩率。

Conclusion: Norm-Q相比传统量化方法在更高压缩率下保持合理性能损失，为概率符号模型的硬件部署提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Hidden Markov models (HMM) are commonly used in generation tasks and have
demonstrated strong capabilities in neuro-symbolic applications for the Markov
property. These applications leverage the strengths of neural networks and
symbolic reasoning to create robust and interpretable AI systems. However, they
may inherit and amplify the shortcomings of both approaches. Both components
require dense computation and data transfer, and their communication further
hinders performance. This paper proposes Norm-Q, a normalized linear
quantization approach for compressing probabilistic symbolic models, such as
HMMs. We reduce the bit width of the data with minimal impact, thereby
alleviating memory and bandwidth stress and enabling deployment on potential
custom hardware. Our method introduces a normalized quantization-aware
expectation maximization process for probabilistic model training. The
experimental results show that Norm-Q achieves a higher compression rate with
reasonable score loss compared to traditional quantization methods. In the case
of the constrained generation task of large language models, we successfully
quantize an HMM of 4096 hidden states to 8 bits without loss and, at most, 3
bits with acceptable loss. Notably, the Norm-Q method can achieve a compression
rate of 99% for the weights of the HMM. The code is open source at

Abstract: Electroencephalogram (EEG) artifact detection in real-world settings faces
significant challenges such as computational inefficiency in multi-channel
methods, poor robustness to simultaneous noise, and trade-offs between accuracy
and complexity in deep learning models. We propose a hybrid spectral-temporal
framework for real-time detection and classification of ocular (EOG), muscular
(EMG), and white noise artifacts in single-channel EEG. This method, in
contrast to other approaches, combines time-domain low-pass filtering
(targeting low-frequency EOG) and frequency-domain power spectral density (PSD)
analysis (capturing broad-spectrum EMG), followed by PCA-optimized feature
fusion to minimize redundancy while preserving discriminative information. This
feature engineering strategy allows a lightweight multi-layer perceptron (MLP)
architecture to outperform advanced CNNs and RNNs by achieving 99% accuracy at
low SNRs (SNR -7) dB and >90% accuracy in moderate noise (SNR 4 dB).
Additionally, this framework addresses the unexplored problem of simultaneous
multi-source contamination(EMG+EOG+white noise), where it maintains 96%
classification accuracy despite overlapping artifacts. With 30-second training
times (97% faster than CNNs) and robust performance across SNR levels, this
framework bridges the gap between clinical applicability and computational
efficiency, which enables real-time use in wearable brain-computer interfaces.
This work also challenges the ubiquitous dependence on model depth for EEG
artifact detection by demonstrating that domain-informed feature fusion
surpasses complex architecture in noisy scenarios.

Abstract: Budget pacing is critical in online advertising to align spend with campaign

parameter tuning, which can be unstable and inefficient. We propose a
principled controller that combines bucketized hysteresis with proportional
feedback to provide stable and adaptive spend control. Our method provides a

demonstrate significant improvements in pacing accuracy and delivery
consistency, reducing pacing error by 13% and $\lambda$-volatility by 54%

Method: 通过100多个受控实验（消耗50万GPU小时），涵盖完整的MLLM构建流程，分析不同模型规模、数据类别和适应设置下的视觉先验发展。

Conclusion: 提出了基于数据中心的预训练方法，为从语言预训练中有意培养视觉先验提供了新途径，推动了下一代多模态LLMs的发展。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), despite being trained on text alone,
surprisingly develop rich visual priors. These priors allow latent visual
capabilities to be unlocked for vision tasks with a relatively small amount of
multimodal data, and in some cases, to perform visual tasks without ever having
seen an image. Through systematic analysis, we reveal that visual priors-the
implicit, emergent knowledge about the visual world acquired during language
pre-training-are composed of separable perception and reasoning priors with
unique scaling trends and origins. We show that an LLM's latent visual
reasoning ability is predominantly developed by pre-training on
reasoning-centric data (e.g., code, math, academia) and scales progressively.
This reasoning prior acquired from language pre-training is transferable and
universally applicable to visual reasoning. In contrast, a perception prior
emerges more diffusely from broad corpora, and perception ability is more
sensitive to the vision encoder and visual instruction tuning data. In
parallel, text describing the visual world proves crucial, though its
performance impact saturates rapidly. Leveraging these insights, we propose a
data-centric recipe for pre-training vision-aware LLMs and verify it in 1T
token scale pre-training. Our findings are grounded in over 100 controlled
experiments consuming 500,000 GPU-hours, spanning the full MLLM construction
pipeline-from LLM pre-training to visual alignment and supervised multimodal
fine-tuning-across five model scales, a wide range of data categories and
mixtures, and multiple adaptation setups. Along with our main findings, we
propose and investigate several hypotheses, and introduce the Multi-Level
Existence Bench (MLE-Bench). Together, this work provides a new way of
deliberately cultivating visual priors from language pre-training, paving the
way for the next generation of multimodal LLMs.

Abstract: Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search (ANNS), as the core of vector databases
(VectorDBs), has become widely used in modern AI and ML systems, powering
applications from information retrieval to bio-informatics. While graph-based
ANNS methods achieve high query efficiency, their scalability is constrained by
the available host memory. Recent disk-based ANNS approaches mitigate memory
usage by offloading data to Solid-State Drives (SSDs). However, they still
suffer from issues such as long I/O traversal path, misalignment with storage
I/O granularity, and high in-memory indexing overhead, leading to significant
I/O latency and ultimately limiting scalability for large-scale vector search.
  In this paper, we propose PageANN, a disk-based approximate nearest neighbor
search (ANNS) framework designed for high performance and scalability. PageANN
introduces a page-node graph structure that aligns logical graph nodes with
physical SSD pages, thereby shortening I/O traversal paths and reducing I/O
operations. Specifically, similar vectors are clustered into page nodes, and a
co-designed disk data layout leverages this structure with a merging technique
to store only representative vectors and topology information, avoiding
unnecessary reads. To further improve efficiency, we design a memory management
strategy that combines lightweight indexing with coordinated memory-disk data
allocation, maximizing host memory utilization while minimizing query latency
and storage overhead. Experimental results show that PageANN significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) disk-based ANNS methods, achieving
1.85x-10.83x higher throughput and 51.7%-91.9% lower latency across different
datasets and memory budgets, while maintaining comparable high recall accuracy.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了Spectral Logit Sculpting (SLS)方法，一种轻量级的推理时优化技术，通过使用最近logits的谱和熵特性动态调整token分布，无需更新模型参数即可提升LLM的可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于熵的推理方法存在计算开销大且未能有效利用历史token上下文的问题，需要一种更高效的优化方法。

Method: SLS维护一个top-K logits的滑动缓冲区，进行实时奇异值分解识别主导谱方向，基于熵和logit间隙统计自适应重新缩放logits，仅在高不确定性时激活。

Result: 在多个公共基准测试中，SLS在数学、编码和科学推理任务上持续优于现有基线方法，获得了更优的准确率。

Conclusion: SLS是一种有效的推理时优化方法，能够在保持上下文一致性的同时锐化输出分布，显著提升LLM性能。

Abstract: Entropy-based inference methods have gained traction for improving the
reliability of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, many existing approaches,
such as entropy minimization techniques, suffer from high computational
overhead and fail to leverage historical token context effectively. To address
these limitations, we propose Spectral Logit Sculpting (SLS), a lightweight
inference-time optimization method that dynamically modulates token
distributions using spectral and entropic properties of recent logits. SLS
maintains a sliding buffer of top-K logits, performs on-the-fly Singular Value
Decomposition (SVD) to identify dominant spectral directions, and adaptively
rescales logits based on both entropy and logit gap statistics--only activating
when uncertainty is high. Without updating any model parameters, SLS
effectively sharpens the output distribution while preserving contextual
consistency. Experimental results on multiple public benchmarks demonstrate
that SLS consistently outperforms existing baseline methods, achieving superior
accuracy in mathematical, coding, and scientific reasoning tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的基于难度的课程强化学习方法存在局部优化问题，早期持续训练简单样本会导致策略失去探索能力。

Method: 将数据集评估中常用的多样性指标转移到动态强化学习过程中，通过最小语义哈密顿路径对训练样本进行排序。

Result: HAMMER激发了模型的"好奇心"，在多样化推理基准测试中平均准确率提升了3%到4%。

Conclusion: 多样性驱动的排序有助于稳定收敛，HAMMER方法有效解决了课程强化学习中的局部优化问题。

Abstract: Recent curriculum reinforcement learning for large language models (LLMs)
typically rely on difficulty-based annotations for data filtering and ordering.
However, such methods suffer from local optimization, where continual training
on simple samples in the early steps can cause the policy to lose its
exploration. We propose a novel schema, namely Hamiltonian curiosity augmented
large language model reinforcement (HAMMER), that transfers diversity metrics,
commonly used in dataset evaluation, into the dynamic reinforcement learning
procedure, where training samples are ordered via a minimum-semantic
Hamiltonian path making the initial training retrain more exploration. From a
theoretical perspective of generalization bounds, diversity-driven ordering
facilitates stable convergence. Empirical evaluations indicate that HAMMER
stimulates model "curiosity" and consistently achieves a 3% to 4% average
accuracy gain across diverse inference benchmark.

TL;DR: PPN是一个轻量级强化学习框架，通过自适应策略选择在保持准确性的同时显著降低计算成本，相比Self-Consistency可减少61.5%的token成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有静态提示策略（如Zero-Shot、Few-Shot、CoT）在效率和准确性之间存在刚性权衡，准确策略如Self-Consistency在简单任务上浪费计算资源，而轻量方法在复杂输入上表现不佳。

Method: 将自适应策略选择形式化为单步马尔可夫决策过程，使用PPO训练Prompt Policy Network，通过资源显式奖励函数学习在必要时分配昂贵推理策略。

Result: 在算术推理基准测试中，PPN在效率-准确性帕累托前沿上实现优越性能，相比Self-Consistency减少61.5%token成本同时保持竞争力准确性。

Conclusion: 提出了一个系统化、自适应的成本高效LLM部署框架，推进了可扩展和可持续语言模型应用的轻量优化技术设计。

Abstract: The performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) depends heavily on the chosen
prompting strategy, yet static approaches such as Zero-Shot, Few-Shot, or
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) impose a rigid efficiency-accuracy trade-off. Highly
accurate strategies like Self-Consistency (SC) incur substantial computational
waste on simple tasks, while lightweight methods often fail on complex inputs.
This paper introduces the Prompt Policy Network (PPN), a lightweight
reinforcement learning framework that formalizes adaptive strategy selection as
a single-step Markov Decision Process (MDP). The PPN, trained with Proximal
Policy Optimization (PPO) and guided by a resource-explicit reward function,
learns to allocate costly reasoning strategies only when necessary. Experiments
on arithmetic reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that PPN achieves superior
performance on the efficiency-accuracy Pareto front, delivering up to 61.5%
token cost reduction compared to Self-Consistency while maintaining competitive
accuracy. This work contributes a systematic, adaptive framework for
cost-efficient LLM deployment, advancing the design of lightweight optimization
techniques for scalable and sustainable language model applications.

TL;DR: 提出了训练重评估曲线(TREC)方法，通过最终模型权重回顾性评估训练批次，发现将高质量数据放置在TREC低点能显著提升模型性能，并证明可以通过AdamW的隐式EMA系数提前预测TREC。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数据课程在LLM训练中至关重要，但最优数据放置原则仍不明确，需要开发能够诊断和优化数据放置的方法。

Method: 引入TREC诊断方法，分析模型如何保留训练数据作为训练时遇到数据时间的函数，使用AdamW的隐式EMA系数预测TREC，并将高质量数据与TREC最小值对齐。

Result: 在111M到3.9B参数的模型上分析TREC，发现将高质量数据放置在TREC低点能显著改善性能，成功改善了3.9B参数LLM在900B token上的持续预训练。

Conclusion: TREC为数据课程设计提供了新视角，能够解释先前的消融实验结果并揭示次优数据放置，通过预测TREC可以实现主动的课程设计。

Abstract: Data curriculums have become central to successful LLM training, yet
principles governing optimal data placement remain unclear. We introduce the
*training re-evaluation curve (TREC)*, a diagnostic that retrospectively
evaluates training batches *using the final model weights*. The TREC
characterizes how well a trained model retains training data as a function of
*when* the data was encountered during training. Analyzing TRECs for models
from 111M to 3.9B parameters, we show that placing high-quality data at low
points on the TREC significantly improves performance. Importantly, while a
TREC is initially observable only after training, we demonstrate it can be
*predicted in advance* from AdamW's implicit EMA coefficients, enabling
proactive curriculum design. By predicting TRECs for published training
recipes, we explain prior ablations and reveal suboptimal data placements. We
also align high-quality data with TREC minima in order to improve continual
pre-training of a 3.9B-parameter LLM trained on 900B tokens.

TL;DR: 本文提出ALoRA和Fed-ALoRA方法，通过不对称的多LoRA设计，在多个任务共享B矩阵，在联邦学习中实现更平衡的性能表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 重新审视多LoRA适配器中A矩阵高度相似的现象，发现这主要源于相同的初始化而非共享知识，B矩阵在知识编码和传递中起更关键作用。

Method: 提出ALoRA（多任务微调中多个A矩阵共享单个B）和Fed-ALoRA（联邦微调中跨客户端共享B），采用新颖的矩阵分解策略处理异构秩问题。

Result: 在常识推理、数学推理、多任务NLP和联邦NLP数据集上的实验表明，相比现有多LoRA方法，新方法在保持相当或更优平均准确率的同时，实现了更平衡的任务性能。

Conclusion: 不对称的LoRA设计能有效提升多任务和联邦学习场景下的性能平衡性，B矩阵共享是关键创新点。

Abstract: Large language models are often adapted using parameter-efficient techniques
such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), formulated as $y = W_0x + BAx$, where $W_0$
is the pre-trained parameters and $x$ is the input to the adapted layer. While
multi-adapter extensions often employ multiple LoRAs, prior studies suggest
that the inner $A$ matrices are highly similar during training and thus
suitable for sharing. We revisit this phenomenon and find that this similarity
is largely attributable to the identical initialization rather than shared
knowledge, with $B$ playing a more critical role in knowledge encoding and
transfer. Motivated by these insights, we propose \textbf{ALoRA}, an asymmetric
multi-LoRA design with multiple $A$ matrices and a single shared $B$ in
multi-task fine-tuning, and \textbf{Fed-ALoRA}, which shares $B$ across clients
in federated fine-tuning under both homogeneous and heterogeneous settings,
through a novel matrix decomposition strategy to accommodate heterogeneous
ranks across clients. Experiments on commonsense reasoning, math reasoning,
multi-task NLP dataset, and federated NLP dataset demonstrate that our methods
achieve more balanced performance across tasks with comparable or superior
average accuracy relative to existing multi-LoRA approaches. Codes are
available at https://github.com/OptMN-Lab/ALoRA.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NuRL是一种通过自生成提示来提升LLM推理能力上限的强化学习方法，解决了传统RL无法从模型无法解决的问题中学习的限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前在线强化学习方法如GRPO存在关键限制：无法从模型无法解决的问题中学习，导致模型的上限无法提升。这些困难样本无法产生训练信号，因为没有rollout能获得奖励。

Method: 提出NuRL方法：模型生成包含问题核心知识的提示，对于通过率为0%的困难样本，注入提示并重新生成轨迹批次。提示是自生成的，避免分布偏移且不依赖外部模型。

Result: NuRL在6个基准测试和3个模型上取得一致改进，能够提升模型的上限，而GRPO则无法改变pass@1024。最佳提示是抽象且高层次的，在GRPO收敛后必要应用时最有效。

Conclusion: NuRL通过自生成提示解锁了从困难样本中学习的能力，有效提升了LLM推理的上限，与传统RL方法形成互补。

Abstract: Current online reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms like GRPO share a key
limitation in LLM reasoning: they cannot learn from problems that are
"unsolvable" to the model. In other words, they can only improve performance on
problems where the model is capable of exploring the correct answer.
Consequently, the model's "upper limit" remains unchanged after RL training,
even though the likelihood of solving easier, solvable problems may increase.
These hard samples cannot contribute to training, as no rollouts yield rewards
and thus no gradients are produced. To unlock learning from these hard samples,
we propose NuRL, a "nudging" method that aims to push the upper bound of LLM
reasoning using self-generated hints, i.e., abstract cues that help reduce the
problem difficulty for the model. Given a question and its gold answer, the
model generates a CoT and then produces a hint containing the core knowledge
needed to solve the problem. During training, we generate G rollouts from the
base policy and use the pass rate to decide whether the hint should be
injected. For hard samples with a 0% pass rate, we inject the hint and
regenerate a new batch of trajectories. This yields two benefits: (1) the hint
boosts pass rates (from 0% to non-zero), thereby introducing training signals
for previously unsolvable samples, and (2) the hints are self-generated,
avoiding distributional shift and do not rely on external models. NuRL achieves
consistent improvements across 6 benchmarks and 3 models, while remaining
complementary to test-time scaling. Notably, NuRL can raise the model's upper
limit, whereas GRPO leaves pass@1024 unchanged from the base model.
Furthermore, we present a systematic study of what makes an effective hint and
when hints are most useful. Interestingly, the best hints are abstract and
high-level, and are most beneficial when applied necessarily and after GRPO has
converged.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出使用视觉语言模型生成伪标签来训练时间序列问答模型的方法，即使伪标签存在噪声，深度神经网络仍能有效学习，最终模型性能超越VLM本身。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 时间序列问答任务面临标注数据缺乏的挑战，而视觉语言模型在零样本分析时间序列信号方面显示出潜力。

Method: 使用视觉语言模型生成伪标签，利用深度神经网络对噪声标签的鲁棒性来训练时间序列问答模型。

Result: 实验结果表明，TSQA模型不仅能用伪标签成功训练，而且通过利用大量未标注数据，性能超越了VLM本身。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了TSQA任务中标注数据不足的问题，证明了使用VLM生成伪标签的可行性。

Abstract: Time-series question answering (TSQA) tasks face significant challenges due
to the lack of labeled data. Alternatively, with recent advancements in
large-scale models, vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated the
potential to analyze time-series signals in a zero-shot manner. In this paper,
we propose a training approach that uses pseudo labels generated by a VLM.
Although VLMs can produce incorrect labels, TSQA models can still be
effectively trained based on the property that deep neural networks are
inherently robust to such noisy labels. Our experimental results demonstrate
that TSQA models are not only successfully trained with pseudo labels, but also
surpass the performance of the VLM itself by leveraging a large amount of
unlabeled data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统声明验证方法忽略证据间复杂交互，导致不可靠结果；完全连接图方法面临数据噪声和偏见两大挑战。

Method: MuPlon框架集成后门路径和前门路径：后门路径优化节点概率权重稀释噪声干扰并加强相关证据连接；前门路径提取相关子图构建推理路径，应用反事实推理消除数据偏见。

Result: 实验结果表明MuPlon优于现有方法，达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: MuPlon通过双因果干预策略有效解决声明验证中的数据噪声和偏见问题，提升验证可靠性。

Abstract: As a critical task in data quality control, claim verification aims to curb
the spread of misinformation by assessing the truthfulness of claims based on a
wide range of evidence. However, traditional methods often overlook the complex
interactions between evidence, leading to unreliable verification results. A
straightforward solution represents the claim and evidence as a fully connected
graph, which we define as the Claim-Evidence Graph (C-E Graph). Nevertheless,
claim verification methods based on fully connected graphs face two primary
confounding challenges, Data Noise and Data Biases. To address these
challenges, we propose a novel framework, Multi-Path Causal Optimization
(MuPlon). MuPlon integrates a dual causal intervention strategy, consisting of
the back-door path and front-door path. In the back-door path, MuPlon dilutes
noisy node interference by optimizing node probability weights, while
simultaneously strengthening the connections between relevant evidence nodes.
In the front-door path, MuPlon extracts highly relevant subgraphs and
constructs reasoning paths, further applying counterfactual reasoning to
eliminate data biases within these paths. The experimental results demonstrate
that MuPlon outperforms existing methods and achieves state-of-the-art
performance.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Rotation Control Unlearning (RCU)的新方法，通过旋转显著性权重和正交旋转轴正则化来解决连续遗忘过程中的累积灾难性效用损失问题，无需保留数据集即可实现SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型广泛应用，其安全漏洞日益受到关注。现有机器遗忘方法不仅依赖保留数据集来保持模型效用，而且在连续遗忘请求下会遭受累积的灾难性效用损失。

Method: RCU方法利用旋转显著性权重量化控制遗忘程度，设计斜对称损失构建认知旋转空间，通过旋转角度变化模拟连续遗忘过程，并采用正交旋转轴正则化确保连续遗忘请求的旋转方向相互垂直。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，该方法无需保留数据集即可达到最先进的性能水平。

Conclusion: RCU方法有效解决了连续遗忘过程中的累积效用损失问题，为机器遗忘提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) become increasingly prevalent, their security
vulnerabilities have already drawn attention. Machine unlearning is introduced
to seek to mitigate these risks by removing the influence of undesirable data.
However, existing methods not only rely on the retained dataset to preserve
model utility, but also suffer from cumulative catastrophic utility loss under
continuous unlearning requests. To solve this dilemma, we propose a novel
method, called Rotation Control Unlearning (RCU), which leverages the
rotational salience weight of RCU to quantify and control the unlearning degree
in the continuous unlearning process. The skew symmetric loss is designed to
construct the existence of the cognitive rotation space, where the changes of
rotational angle can simulate the continuous unlearning process. Furthermore,
we design an orthogonal rotation axes regularization to enforce mutually
perpendicular rotation directions for continuous unlearning requests,
effectively minimizing interference and addressing cumulative catastrophic
utility loss. Experiments on multiple datasets confirm that our method without
retained dataset achieves SOTA performance.

TL;DR: 论文提出了RA3算法，通过中期训练构建动作抽象空间，提高强化学习效率，在代码生成任务中显著提升性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在强化学习中表现优异，但需要中期训练阶段来识别有用的动作集合并实现快速选择，以充分释放其潜力

Method: 提出RA3算法，通过推导序列变分下界，使用强化学习迭代发现时间一致的潜在结构，然后在引导数据上进行微调

Result: 在代码生成任务中，RA3在HumanEval和MBPP上比基础模型和下一个token预测基线分别提升8分和4分，在多个基准测试中实现更快收敛和更高渐近性能

Conclusion: 中期训练在决策空间紧凑且有效视野短时最有效，强调了在动作抽象空间而非原始动作空间操作的重要性

Abstract: Large language models excel with reinforcement learning (RL), but fully
unlocking this potential requires a mid-training stage. An effective
mid-training phase should identify a compact set of useful actions and enable
fast selection among them through online RL. We formalize this intuition by
presenting the first theoretical result on how mid-training shapes
post-training: it characterizes an action subspace that minimizes both the
value approximation error from pruning and the RL error during subsequent
planning. Our analysis reveals two key determinants of mid-training
effectiveness: pruning efficiency, which shapes the prior of the initial RL
policy, and its impact on RL convergence, which governs the extent to which
that policy can be improved via online interactions. These results suggest that
mid-training is most effective when the decision space is compact and the
effective horizon is short, highlighting the importance of operating in the
space of action abstractions rather than primitive actions. Building on these
insights, we propose Reasoning as Action Abstractions (RA3), a scalable
mid-training algorithm. Specifically, we derive a sequential variational lower
bound and optimize it by iteratively discovering temporally-consistent latent
structures via RL, followed by fine-tuning on the bootstrapped data.
Experiments on code generation tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach. Across multiple base models, RA3 improves the average performance on
HumanEval and MBPP by 8 and 4 points over the base model and the next-token
prediction baseline. Furthermore, RA3 achieves faster convergence and higher
asymptotic performance in RLVR on HumanEval+, MBPP+, LiveCodeBench, and
Codeforces.

TL;DR: 提出一种基于背包问题的最优探索预算分配方法，解决LLM自我改进中均匀分配导致的梯度消失问题，显著提升训练效率和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM自我改进方法中，均匀分配探索预算导致简单任务总是成功、困难任务总是失败，两者在GRPO训练中都会产生零梯度，影响学习效果。

Method: 将每个任务的探索视为具有不同"价值"和"成本"的"物品"，建立与经典背包问题的联系，推导出基于模型当前学习状态的自适应资源分配规则。

Result: 在GRPO训练中，非零策略梯度的有效比例提高20-40%，能为特别困难的问题分配更大预算（如93次rollout），在数学推理基准上平均提升2-4分，特定任务峰值提升9分。

Conclusion: 该方法作为计算"免费午餐"，能够将探索预算从学习饱和的任务重新分配到最有影响力的任务，相比传统均匀分配，达到相同性能可节省约2倍计算资源。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can self-improve through reinforcement learning,
where they generate trajectories to explore and discover better solutions.
However, this exploration process is computationally expensive, often forcing
current methods to assign limited exploration budgets to each task. This
uniform allocation creates problematic edge cases: easy tasks consistently
succeed while difficult tasks consistently fail, both producing zero gradients
during training updates for the widely used Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO). We address this problem from the lens of exploration budget allocation.
Viewing each task's exploration as an "item" with a distinct "value" and
"cost", we establish a connection to the classical knapsack problem. This
formulation allows us to derive an optimal assignment rule that adaptively
distributes resources based on the model's current learning status. When
applied to GRPO, our method increases the effective ratio of non-zero policy
gradients by 20-40% during training. Acting as a computational "free lunch",
our approach could reallocate exploration budgets from tasks where learning is
saturated to those where it is most impactful. This enables significantly
larger budgets (e.g., 93 rollouts) for especially challenging problems, which
would be computationally prohibitive under a uniform allocation. These
improvements translate to meaningful gains on mathematical reasoning
benchmarks, with average improvements of 2-4 points and peak gains of 9 points
on specific tasks. Notably, achieving comparable performance with traditional
homogeneous allocation would require about 2x the computational resources.

factors: key variables, relationships, and decision boundary values for
predicting target classes. We demonstrate that the robustness of LLMs varies
significantly over different datasets, and that high-quality LLM-generated

opens a new direction for assessing and enhancing the reliability of LLM-driven

Motivation: 现有区域天气预报方法受限于静态不精确的区域边界，导致泛化能力差，需要更灵活的动态边界优化方法。

Method: 使用空间对齐注意力机制初始化并自适应优化区域边界，设计时间混合专家模块基于离散高斯分布将不同月份的大气变量动态路由到专门专家。

Result: 在全局和区域预报、极端事件预测和集合预报四个任务中均优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: STCast框架通过自适应边界优化和动态时间分配，显著提升了区域天气预报的准确性和泛化能力。

Abstract: To gain finer regional forecasts, many works have explored the regional
integration from the global atmosphere, e.g., by solving boundary equations in
physics-based methods or cropping regions from global forecasts in data-driven
methods. However, the effectiveness of these methods is often constrained by
static and imprecise regional boundaries, resulting in poor generalization
ability. To address this issue, we propose Spatial-Temporal Weather Forecasting
(STCast), a novel AI-driven framework for adaptive regional boundary
optimization and dynamic monthly forecast allocation. Specifically, our
approach employs a Spatial-Aligned Attention (SAA) mechanism, which aligns
global and regional spatial distributions to initialize boundaries and
adaptively refines them based on attention-derived alignment patterns.
Furthermore, we design a Temporal Mixture-of-Experts (TMoE) module, where
atmospheric variables from distinct months are dynamically routed to
specialized experts using a discrete Gaussian distribution, enhancing the
model's ability to capture temporal patterns. Beyond global and regional
forecasting, we evaluate our STCast on extreme event prediction and ensemble
forecasting. Experimental results demonstrate consistent superiority over
state-of-the-art methods across all four tasks.

Motivation: CNN超参数优化通常需要大量试错或网格搜索，计算成本高昂。本研究旨在将传统用于质量工程的田口实验设计方法应用于CNN超参数优化，提供系统化的优化框架。

Method: 使用L12(211)正交阵列系统评估8个超参数（图像尺寸、颜色模式、激活函数、学习率、重缩放、洗牌、垂直翻转、水平翻转）。开发了5种多目标优化方法，结合信噪比分析和新型对数缩放技术来统一冲突指标。

Result: 方法3（结合加权准确率指标和对数变换损失函数）表现最佳，达到98.84%训练准确率和86.25%验证准确率，同时保持最小损失值。田口分析显示学习率是最具影响力的参数，其次是图像尺寸和激活函数。

Conclusion: 田口实验设计方法能有效优化CNN超参数，学习率是最关键参数。该方法为CNN超参数优化提供了系统化的指导框架，避免了传统试错方法的高计算成本。

Abstract: The optimization of hyperparameters in convolutional neural networks (CNNs)
remains a challenging and computationally expensive process, often requiring
extensive trial-and-error approaches or exhaustive grid searches. This study
introduces the application of Taguchi Design of Experiments methodology, a
statistical optimization technique traditionally used in quality engineering,
to systematically optimize CNN hyperparameters for professional boxing action
recognition. Using an L12(211) orthogonal array, eight hyperparameters
including image size, color mode, activation function, learning rate,
rescaling, shuffling, vertical flip, and horizontal flip were systematically
evaluated across twelve experimental configurations. To address the
multi-objective nature of machine learning optimization, five different
approaches were developed to simultaneously optimize training accuracy,
validation accuracy, training loss, and validation loss using Signal-to-Noise
ratio analysis. The study employed a novel logarithmic scaling technique to
unify conflicting metrics and enable comprehensive multi-quality assessment
within the Taguchi framework. Results demonstrate that Approach 3, combining
weighted accuracy metrics with logarithmically transformed loss functions,
achieved optimal performance with 98.84% training accuracy and 86.25%
validation accuracy while maintaining minimal loss values. The Taguchi analysis
revealed that learning rate emerged as the most influential parameter, followed
by image size and activation function, providing clear guidance for
hyperparameter prioritization in CNN optimization.

*Weiyu Huang,Yuezhou Hu,Jun Zhu,Jianfei Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CAST是一个完全连续可微的稀疏感知训练框架，用于半结构化稀疏模型，通过联合优化稀疏模式和权重，显著提升模型性能并减少训练资源需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 稀疏感知训练可以有效减少大语言模型在推理时的延迟和内存消耗，但现有方法通常分别优化稀疏模式和权重，缺乏联合优化能力。

Method: CAST框架包含三个关键组件：AdamS稀疏感知优化器（使用自适应L1衰减促进均匀稀疏化）、权重缩放模块（缓解衰减导致的幅度减少）、知识蒸馏（使用密集模型作为自教师提升效率）。

Result: 在2:4稀疏模式下，从125M到13B参数的多模型家族中，CAST显著优于现有方法。LLaMA2-7B稀疏模型仅用2%原始预训练token，困惑度仅增加0.09，零样本准确率提升0.36%。

Conclusion: CAST提供了一个有效的稀疏训练框架，能够以极少的训练资源获得高性能稀疏模型，并建立了可预测稀疏模型性能的扩展规律，展示了在量化和微调场景下的实用性。

Abstract: Sparsity-aware training is an effective approach for transforming large
language models (LLMs) into hardware-friendly sparse patterns, thereby reducing
latency and memory consumption during inference. In this paper, we propose
Continuous Adaptive Sparse Trainer (CAST), a fully continuous and
differentiable sparsity-aware training framework for semi-structured (or "N:M")
sparse models. Unlike previous approaches that optimize sparsity patterns and
weights separately, CAST enables seamless joint optimization during training,
while progressively transforming the model into the desired sparsity format.
Specifically, CAST introduces three key components: 1) AdamS, a sparsity-aware
optimizer that leverages adaptive L1 decay to promote uniform sparsification
across all parameters; 2) Weight Scaling, a module designed to mitigate the
magnitude reduction caused by decay while preserving desired sparsity patterns;
3) Knowledge Distillation, which employs the dense model as a self-teacher to
enhance training efficiency. We evaluate CAST under 2:4 sparsity patterns
across multiple model families, ranging from 125M to 13B parameters. Our
results demonstrate significant improvements over previous state-of-the-art
methods in both perplexity and zero-shot accuracy with minimal training
resources. Notably, on LLaMA2-7B, our 2:4 sparse model achieves a negligible
perplexity increase of 0.09 and a 0.36% gain in zero-shot accuracy compared to
the dense model using only 2% of the original pretraining tokens. Additionally,
we establish an accurate and robust empirical scaling law to predict sparse
model performance given adequate training resources. Finally, we demonstrate
the practical applicability of our sparse models by evaluating them under
quantization and fine-tuning scenarios.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CoA-LoRA提出了一种动态调整LoRA适配器的方法，无需为每个量化配置重复微调，通过配置感知模型将任意量化配置映射到低秩调整。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型预训练模型在边缘设备上的部署需求增加，需要有效的压缩方法。现有方法需要为每个量化配置单独微调LoRA适配器，这在异构边缘设备上计算成本过高。

Method: 使用配置感知模型将任意量化配置映射到低秩调整，并通过帕累托优化方法迭代优化训练配置集，生成更精确的低秩调整。

Result: 实验表明，CoA-LoRA无需额外时间成本，就能达到甚至超过需要为每个配置单独微调的最先进方法的性能。

Conclusion: CoA-LoRA提供了一种高效的方法，在边缘设备上动态适应不同量化配置，解决了异构设备部署的挑战。

Abstract: As increasingly large pre-trained models are released, deploying them on edge
devices for privacy-preserving applications requires effective compression.
Recent works combine quantization with the fine-tuning of high-precision LoRA
adapters, which can substantially reduce model size while mitigating the
accuracy loss from quantization. However, edge devices have inherently
heterogeneous capabilities, while performing configuration-wise fine-tuning for
every quantization setting is computationally prohibitive. In this paper, we
propose CoA-LoRA, a method that dynamically adjusts the LoRA adapter to
arbitrary quantization configurations (i.e., the per-layer bit-width choices of
a pre-trained model) without requiring repeated fine-tuning. This is
accomplished via a configuration-aware model that maps each configuration to
its low-rank adjustments. The effectiveness of this model critically depends on
the training configuration set, a collection of configurations chosen to cover
different total bit-width budgets. However, constructing a high-quality
configuration set is non-trivial. We therefore design a Pareto-based
configuration search that iteratively optimizes the training configuration set,
yielding more precise low-rank adjustments. Our experiments demonstrate that,
unlike the state-of-the-art methods that require fine-tuning a separate LoRA
adapter for each configuration, CoA-LoRA incurs no additional time cost while
achieving comparable or even superior performance to those methods.

TL;DR: 提出了FITS系统，使用基于BERT的模型对时尚行业可持续发展信息进行分类，解决该领域可信信息稀缺的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 时尚行业可持续发展信息有限且难以解读，通用语言模型缺乏领域知识且容易产生幻觉，在事实准确性至关重要的领域尤其有害。

Method: 使用基于BERT的语言模型，包括在科学和气候特定数据上预训练的模型，在定制语料库上进行微调，采用领域特定分类模式，并通过贝叶斯优化优化超参数。

Result: 开发了FITS原型系统，可从可信的非结构化文本源提取和分类可持续发展信息，并通过用户焦点组评估了可用性、视觉设计、内容清晰度等方面。

Conclusion: 领域适应的NLP在促进知情决策方面具有价值，AI应用在应对气候相关挑战方面具有更广泛潜力，同时提供了可持续纺织语料库数据集和更新方法。

Abstract: Access to credible sustainability information in the fashion industry remains
limited and challenging to interpret, despite growing public and regulatory
demands for transparency. General-purpose language models often lack
domain-specific knowledge and tend to "hallucinate", which is particularly
harmful for fields where factual correctness is crucial. This work explores how
Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques can be applied to classify
sustainability data for fashion brands, thereby addressing the scarcity of
credible and accessible information in this domain. We present a prototype
Fashion Information Tool for Sustainability (FITS), a transformer-based system
that extracts and classifies sustainability information from credible,
unstructured text sources: NGO reports and scientific publications. Several
BERT-based language models, including models pretrained on scientific and
climate-specific data, are fine-tuned on our curated corpus using a
domain-specific classification schema, with hyperparameters optimized via
Bayesian optimization. FITS allows users to search for relevant data, analyze
their own data, and explore the information via an interactive interface. We
evaluated FITS in two focus groups of potential users concerning usability,
visual design, content clarity, possible use cases, and desired features. Our
results highlight the value of domain-adapted NLP in promoting informed
decision-making and emphasize the broader potential of AI applications in
addressing climate-related challenges. Finally, this work provides a valuable
dataset, the SustainableTextileCorpus, along with a methodology for future
updates. Code available at https://github.com/daphne12345/FITS

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决概率图模型中最可能解释推理这一本质难解问题，现有方法在复杂高树宽PGM上效率低下

Method: 训练神经网络评估变量赋值效用，从现有MPE求解器搜索轨迹中提取训练信号，将学习到的启发式与搜索算法集成

Result: 在高树宽PGM的挑战性MPE查询上，学习到的启发式显著减少搜索空间，同时保持或改进最先进方法的解质量

Conclusion: L2C为加速MPE推理提供了可扩展的数据驱动框架，证明了学习条件策略在复杂推理问题中的有效性

Abstract: We introduce learning to condition (L2C), a scalable, data-driven framework
for accelerating Most Probable Explanation (MPE) inference in Probabilistic
Graphical Models (PGMs), a fundamentally intractable problem. L2C trains a
neural network to score variable-value assignments based on their utility for
conditioning, given observed evidence. To facilitate supervised learning, we
develop a scalable data generation pipeline that extracts training signals from
the search traces of existing MPE solvers. The trained network serves as a
heuristic that integrates with search algorithms, acting as a conditioning
strategy prior to exact inference or as a branching and node selection policy
within branch-and-bound solvers. We evaluate L2C on challenging MPE queries
involving high-treewidth PGMs. Experiments show that our learned heuristic
significantly reduces the search space while maintaining or improving solution
quality over state-of-the-art methods.

*Aoming Liu,Kevin Miller,Venkatesh Saligrama,Kate Saenko,Boqing Gong,Ser-Nam Lim,Bryan A. Plummer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了Temporal Experts Averaging (TEA)框架，通过权重平均更新整个模型来应对时间域泛化问题，相比仅预测分类器层的方法具有更好的泛化能力和计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有时间域泛化方法通常只预测分类器层权重，限制了模型其他组件的调整能力，而全模型预测又计算成本过高。

Method: TEA框架包含两个步骤：1) 在保持参数相似性的前提下，通过在单个时间域上微调基础模型创建功能多样化的专家模型；2) 在主成分子空间中建模时间权重轨迹，通过自适应平均系数优化偏差-方差权衡。

Result: 在7个TDG基准测试、5个模型和2种TDG设置下，TEA比现有方法性能提升高达69%，同时计算效率提高60倍。

Conclusion: TEA通过权重平均有效解决了时间域泛化问题，在保持计算效率的同时显著提升了模型对未来时间域的泛化能力。

Abstract: Temporal Domain Generalization (TDG) aims to generalize across temporal
distribution shifts, e.g., lexical change over time. Prior work often addresses
this by predicting future model weights. However, full model prediction is
prohibitively expensive for even reasonably sized models. Thus, recent methods
only predict the classifier layer, limiting generalization by failing to adjust
other model components. To address this, we propose Temporal Experts Averaging
(TEA), a novel and scalable TDG framework that updates the entire model using
weight averaging to maximize generalization potential while minimizing
computational costs. Our theoretical analysis guides us to two steps that
enhance generalization to future domains. First, we create expert models with
functional diversity yet parameter similarity by fine-tuning a domain-agnostic
base model on individual temporal domains while constraining weight changes.
Second, we optimize the bias-variance tradeoff through adaptive averaging
coefficients derived from modeling temporal weight trajectories in a principal
component subspace. Expert's contributions are based on their projected
proximity to future domains. Extensive experiments across 7 TDG benchmarks, 5
models, and 2 TDG settings shows TEA outperforms prior TDG methods by up to 69%
while being up to 60x more efficient.

*Xunhao Lai,Jialiang Kang,Jianqiao Lu,Tong Lin,Pengyu Zhao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了Residual Linear Attention (RLA)框架，通过显式残差拟合机制增强线性注意力的表达能力，解决了传统线性注意力在捕捉长距离模式时的瓶颈问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 线性注意力虽然提供线性时间复杂度的替代方案，但在捕捉长距离模式时表现不佳。现有变体通常只能进行历史预测和单令牌校正，形成了表达能力瓶颈。

Method: RLA框架为线性注意力配备了显式残差拟合机制，维护辅助循环状态来累积残差误差并修正基础预测。进一步实例化了Delta规则版本RDN，包含自适应门控和残差裁剪以增强校正控制和稳定性。

Result: 在语言建模和召回密集型评估中，RLA和RDN始终优于各自基线和现代线性注意力方法，缩小了与标准Transformer的差距，同时保持线性缩放。

Conclusion: RLA框架有效解决了线性注意力的表达能力瓶颈，通过残差拟合机制显著提升了性能，在保持线性时间复杂度的同时接近标准Transformer的表现。

Abstract: Linear attention offers a linear-time alternative to self-attention but often
struggles to capture long-range patterns. We revisit linear attention through a
prediction-correction lens and show that prevalent variants can be written as a
combination of a historical prediction and a single-token correction, which
creates an expressivity bottleneck. To address this bottleneck, we introduce
Residual Linear Attention (RLA), a framework that equips linear attention with
an explicit residual-fitting mechanism. RLA maintains an auxiliary recurrent
state that learns to accumulate residual errors over time and correct the base
prediction. We further instantiate a delta-rule version, Residual Delta Net
(RDN), incorporating adaptive gating and residual clipping for enhanced
correction control and stability. Our implementation leverages highly optimized
linear attention kernels and preserves linear time and memory. Across language
modeling and recall-intensive evaluations, RLA and RDN consistently outperform
their respective baselines and other modern linear-attention methods, narrowing
the gap to standard Transformers while retaining linear scaling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统流匹配方法依赖直线条件路径，而学习测地线的方法使用RBF核或最近邻图，这些方法受到维度灾难的影响。

Method: 使用分数匹配和退火能量蒸馏学习度量张量，该张量能忠实捕捉底层数据几何结构。

Result: 在具有解析测地线的合成流形上验证了该策略的有效性，并应用于细胞插值。

Conclusion: 提出的方法能够更准确地学习数据流形上的几何结构，改进流匹配性能。

Abstract: A useful inductive bias for temporal data is that trajectories should stay
close to the data manifold. Traditional flow matching relies on straight
conditional paths, and flow matching methods which learn geodesics rely on RBF
kernels or nearest neighbor graphs that suffer from the curse of
dimensionality. We propose to use score matching and annealed energy
distillation to learn a metric tensor that faithfully captures the underlying
data geometry and informs more accurate flows. We demonstrate the efficacy of
this strategy on synthetic manifolds with analytic geodesics, and interpolation
of cell

TL;DR: TFPI通过在RLVR训练中引入ThinkFree操作，丢弃思维内容来减少推理时的token使用，从而加速收敛、提高性能上限并降低计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RLVR虽然能有效解决复杂任务，但训练时需要极长的上下文长度，导致计算成本高昂。多阶段训练虽能部分缓解，但过短的初始上下文会导致不可逆的性能下降。

Method: 提出TFPI方法，在RLVR中引入ThinkFree操作，通过直接追加</think>标记来显式丢弃思维内容，减少推理时的token使用。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，TFPI加速了RL收敛，达到更高的性能上限，并产生更token高效推理模型。仅使用TFPI，4B模型在AIME24上达到89.0%准确率，在LiveCodeBench上达到65.5%，使用不到4K H20小时。

Conclusion: TFPI是一种简单有效的RLVR适配方法，无需专门奖励或复杂训练设计，就能显著提升训练效率和模型性能。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Reward (RLVR) effectively solves
complex tasks but demands extremely long context lengths during training,
leading to substantial computational costs. While multi-stage training can
partially mitigate this, starting with overly short contexts often causes
irreversible performance degradation, ultimately failing to reduce overall
training compute significantly. In this paper, we introduce
**T**hinking-**F**ree **P**olicy **I**nitialization (**TFPI**), a simple yet
effective adaptation to RLVR that bridges long Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
distillation and standard RLVR. TFPI employs a simple *ThinkFree* operation,
explicitly discarding the thinking content via a direct *</think>* append, to
reduce token usage during inference. Training with *ThinkFree*-adapted inputs
improves performance and lowers token consumption, even in the original
slow-thinking mode. Extensive experiments across various benchmarks have shown
that TFPI accelerates RL convergence, achieves a higher performance ceiling,
and yields more token-efficient reasoning models without specialized rewards or
complex training designs. With TFPI only, we train a 4B model to reach 89.0%
accuracy on AIME24 and 65.5% on LiveCodeBench using less than 4K H20 hours.

Motivation: 联邦学习在车联网等动态异构环境中面临数据异构性和设备异构性的挑战，需要提高模型精度并优化资源利用

Method: FedCLF方法引入校准损失作为参与者选择标准，并使用反馈控制机制动态调整客户端采样频率

Result: 在CIFAR-10数据集上测试，FedCLF在高度异构数据场景下比FedAvg、Newt和Oort基线模型性能提升达16%，同时通过减少采样频率提高了效率

Conclusion: FedCLF能有效处理联邦学习中的数据异构性问题，在车联网等资源受限环境中具有更好的性能和效率

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a distributed machine learning technique that
preserves data privacy by sharing only the trained parameters instead of the
client data. This makes FL ideal for highly dynamic, heterogeneous, and
time-critical applications, in particular, the Internet of Vehicles (IoV)
networks. However, FL encounters considerable challenges in such networks owing
to the high data and device heterogeneity. To address these challenges, we
propose FedCLF, i.e., FL with Calibrated Loss and Feedback control, which
introduces calibrated loss as a utility in the participant selection process
and a feedback control mechanism to dynamically adjust the sampling frequency
of the clients. The envisaged approach (a) enhances the overall model accuracy
in case of highly heterogeneous data and (b) optimizes the resource utilization
for resource constrained IoV networks, thereby leading to increased efficiency
in the FL process. We evaluated FedCLF vis-\`a-vis baseline models, i.e.,
FedAvg, Newt, and Oort, using CIFAR-10 dataset with varying data heterogeneity.
Our results depict that FedCLF significantly outperforms the baseline models by
up to a 16% improvement in high data heterogeneity-related scenarios with
improved efficiency via reduced sampling frequency.

Abstract: Correct identification of failure mechanisms is essential for manufacturers
to ensure the quality of their products. Certain failures of printheads
developed by Canon Production Printing can be identified from the behavior of
individual nozzles, the states of which are constantly recorded and can form
distinct patterns in terms of the number of failed nozzles over time, and in
space in the nozzle grid. In our work, we investigate the problem of printhead
failure classification based on a multifaceted dataset of nozzle logging and
propose a Machine Learning classification approach for this problem. We follow
the feature-based framework of time-series classification, where a set of
time-based and spatial features was selected with the guidance of domain
experts. Several traditional ML classifiers were evaluated, and the One-vs-Rest
Random Forest was found to have the best performance. The proposed model
outperformed an in-house rule-based baseline in terms of a weighted F1 score
for several failure mechanisms.

TL;DR: PALADIN是一个训练语言代理从工具故障中恢复的框架，通过系统性的故障注入和专家演示训练，在推理时检测错误并检索相似故障案例来执行恢复动作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的代理训练管道只针对成功轨迹进行优化，未能让模型接触现实世界中占主导地位的工具故障，导致工具增强语言代理在真实部署中经常因工具故障而失败。

Method: PALADIN在增强的ToolBench数据集上，通过系统性故障注入和专家演示构建了50,000+个恢复注释轨迹进行训练，使用LoRA微调保留基础能力同时注入恢复能力。推理时检测运行时错误并从55+个故障范例库中检索最相似案例执行恢复动作。

Result: PALADIN在PaladinEval和ToolReflectEval评估中显著提升了恢复率(RR)、任务成功率(TSR)、灾难性成功率(CSR)和效率得分(ES)。恢复率从32.76%提升至89.68%，比最强基线CRITIC高出13.3%，对未见工具API保持95.2%的恢复性能。

Conclusion: PALADIN是构建容错代理的有效方法，能够在真实世界工具环境中实现稳健恢复。

Abstract: Tool-augmented language agents frequently fail in real-world deployment due
to tool malfunctions--timeouts, API exceptions, or inconsistent
outputs--triggering cascading reasoning errors and task abandonment. Existing
agent training pipelines optimize only for success trajectories, failing to
expose models to the tool failures that dominate real-world usage. We propose
\textbf{PALADIN}, a generalizable framework for equipping language agents with
robust failure recovery capabilities. PALADIN trains on 50,000+
recovery-annotated trajectories constructed via systematic failure injection
and expert demonstrations on an enhanced ToolBench dataset. Training uses
LoRA-based fine-tuning to retain base capabilities while injecting recovery
competence. At inference, PALADIN detects execution-time errors and retrieves
the most similar case from a curated bank of 55+ failure exemplars aligned with
ToolScan's taxonomy, then executes the corresponding recovery action. This
approach generalizes to novel failures beyond the training distribution,
retaining 95.2\% recovery performance on unseen tool APIs. Evaluation across
PaladinEval and ToolReflectEval demonstrates consistent improvements in
Recovery Rate (RR), Task Success Rate (TSR), Catastrophic Success Rate (CSR),
and Efficiency Score (ES). PALADIN improves RR from 32.76% to 89.68% (+57%
relative) over ToolBench and outperforms the strongest baseline CRITIC (76.34%)
by +13.3%. Against vanilla agents, PALADIN achieves 89.86\% RR (+66% relative
improvement from 23.75%). These results establish PALADIN as an effective
method for building fault-tolerant agents capable of robust recovery in
real-world tool environments.

Conclusion: 双曲优化方法不仅在双曲流形上有效，也可能在欧几里得和其他非欧几里得设置中提供益处，特别是在训练早期阶段加速收敛。

Abstract: This work explores optimization methods on hyperbolic manifolds. Building on
Riemannian optimization principles, we extend the Hyperbolic Stochastic
Gradient Descent (a specialization of Riemannian SGD) to a Hyperbolic Adam
optimizer. While these methods are particularly relevant for learning on the
Poincar\'e ball, they may also provide benefits in Euclidean and other
non-Euclidean settings, as the chosen optimization encourages the learning of
Poincar\'e embeddings. This representation, in turn, accelerates convergence in
the early stages of training, when parameters are far from the optimum. As a
case study, we train diffusion models using the hyperbolic optimization methods
with hyperbolic time-discretization of the Langevin dynamics, and show that
they achieve faster convergence on certain datasets without sacrificing
generative quality.

TL;DR: InfMasking是一种对比协同信息提取方法，通过无限掩码策略增强多模态表示中的协同信息，在七个基准测试中达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态表示学习中，模态间的协同交互不仅提供互补信息，还能产生单一模态无法实现的独特结果。现有方法难以有效捕捉完整的协同信息谱，导致在依赖此类交互的任务中性能欠佳。

Method: 提出InfMasking方法，在融合过程中随机遮挡每个模态的大部分特征，仅保留部分信息以创建具有不同协同模式的表示。通过互信息最大化将未掩码的融合表示与掩码表示对齐，以编码全面的协同信息。

Conclusion: InfMasking通过无限掩码策略成功解决了多模态表示学习中协同信息提取的挑战，为多模态学习提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: In multimodal representation learning, synergistic interactions between
modalities not only provide complementary information but also create unique
outcomes through specific interaction patterns that no single modality could
achieve alone. Existing methods may struggle to effectively capture the full
spectrum of synergistic information, leading to suboptimal performance in tasks
where such interactions are critical. This is particularly problematic because
synergistic information constitutes the fundamental value proposition of
multimodal representation. To address this challenge, we introduce InfMasking,
a contrastive synergistic information extraction method designed to enhance
synergistic information through an \textbf{Inf}inite \textbf{Masking} strategy.
InfMasking stochastically occludes most features from each modality during
fusion, preserving only partial information to create representations with
varied synergistic patterns. Unmasked fused representations are then aligned
with masked ones through mutual information maximization to encode
comprehensive synergistic information. This infinite masking strategy enables
capturing richer interactions by exposing the model to diverse partial modality
combinations during training. As computing mutual information estimates with
infinite masking is computationally prohibitive, we derive an InfMasking loss
to approximate this calculation. Through controlled experiments, we demonstrate

### [428] [Clarification as Supervision: Reinforcement Learning for Vision-Language Interfaces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26594)
*John Gkountouras,Ivan Titov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AC-RL通过交互式学习训练视觉模型生成更全面的图像描述，使数学推理系统能一次性解决问题，无需额外澄清请求，在7个视觉数学推理基准上平均准确率提升4.4个百分点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型生成的图像描述为人类读者设计，往往省略推理系统所需的精确细节，导致推理失败不是由于推理能力限制，而是因为缺乏关键视觉信息。

Method: 提出自适应澄清强化学习(AC-RL)，通过训练过程中的澄清请求识别信息缺口，惩罚需要澄清的成功案例，从而促使模型生成更全面的初始描述。

Result: 在七个视觉数学推理基准上，AC-RL相比预训练基线平均准确率提升4.4个百分点，分析显示如果允许澄清请求，可减少高达39%的澄清需求。

Conclusion: AC-RL证明通过交互式学习可以有效地训练视觉语言接口，无需显式标注，澄清请求可作为隐式监督信号。

Abstract: Recent text-only models demonstrate remarkable mathematical reasoning
capabilities. Extending these to visual domains requires vision-language models
to translate images into text descriptions. However, current models, trained to
produce captions for human readers, often omit the precise details that
reasoning systems require. This creates an interface mismatch: reasoners often
fail not due to reasoning limitations but because they lack access to critical
visual information. We propose Adaptive-Clarification Reinforcement Learning
(AC-RL), which teaches vision models what information reasoners need through
interaction. Our key insight is that clarification requests during training
reveal information gaps; by penalizing success that requires clarification, we
create pressure for comprehensive initial captions that enable the reasoner to
solve the problem in a single pass. AC-RL improves average accuracy by 4.4
points over pretrained baselines across seven visual mathematical reasoning
benchmarks, and analysis shows it would cut clarification requests by up to 39%
if those were allowed. By treating clarification as a form of implicit
supervision, AC-RL demonstrates that vision-language interfaces can be
effectively learned through interaction alone, without requiring explicit
annotations.

Motivation: 现有过程监督强化学习方法在分支位置和采样方面探索效率有限，需要更有效的探索策略来提升推理模型的性能。

Method: 基于注意力分数选择高价值分支位置，设计自适应采样策略考虑问题难度和历史批次大小，并采用一步离策略训练流程。

Result: 在多个数学推理基准测试中，该方法在性能、采样和训练效率方面均优于先前方法。

Conclusion: AttnRL框架通过注意力引导的分支选择和高效采样策略，显著提升了过程监督强化学习在推理任务中的效果和效率。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has shown remarkable success in enhancing the
reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). Process-Supervised RL
(PSRL) has emerged as a more effective paradigm compared to outcome-based RL.
However, existing PSRL approaches suffer from limited exploration efficiency,
both in terms of branching positions and sampling. In this paper, we introduce
a novel PSRL framework (AttnRL), which enables efficient exploration for
reasoning models. Motivated by preliminary observations that steps exhibiting
high attention scores correlate with reasoning behaviors, we propose to branch
from positions with high values. Furthermore, we develop an adaptive sampling
strategy that accounts for problem difficulty and historical batch size,
ensuring that the whole training batch maintains non-zero advantage values. To
further improve sampling efficiency, we design a one-step off-policy training
pipeline for PSRL. Extensive experiments on multiple challenging mathematical
reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms prior
approaches in terms of performance and sampling and training efficiency.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的特征蒸馏方法，使用Procrustes距离和特征Gram矩阵的Frobenius范数作为蒸馏损失，在语言模型蒸馏任务中取得了显著改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统特征蒸馏方法（如投影均方误差或CKA）无法有效捕捉教师模型的特征空间结构，即使损失为零时也存在问题。

Method: 采用Procrustes距离和特征Gram矩阵的Frobenius范数作为蒸馏损失函数，这些距离在表示对齐测量中已有应用。

Result: 在BERT和OPT语言模型家族的分类和指令跟随任务中，蒸馏性能提升了高达2个百分点，具有统计显著性。

Conclusion: 将特征几何整合到现有蒸馏方法中具有巨大潜力，能够显著提升知识蒸馏的效果。

Abstract: Knowledge distillation is a common paradigm for transferring capabilities
from larger models to smaller ones. While traditional distillation methods
leverage a probabilistic divergence over the output of the teacher and student
models, feature-based distillation methods often minimize variants of Euclidean
norms between the hidden layer representations. The main goal is for the
student to mimic the structure of the feature space of the teacher. In this
work, we theoretically show that existing feature distillation methods, such as
projection based mean squared loss or Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA), cannot
capture the feature structure, even under zero loss. We then motivate the use
of Procrustes distance and the Frobenius norm of Feature Gram Matrix, distances
already common in the context of measuring representational alignment, as
distillation losses. We show that feature distillation through our method
showcases statistically significant improvement in distillation performance
across language models families (BERT and OPT) in classification and
instruction-following tasks by up to 2 percentage points, showcasing the
potential of integrating feature geometry into existing distillation methods.

TL;DR: 提出了RainfallBench基准测试，专门用于降雨临近预报（0-3小时预测），解决了现有气象基准测试在复杂降雨场景下的不足，并开发了BFPF模块来应对零膨胀和时间衰减问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有时间序列预测基准主要评估温度、湿度等周期性强的变量，无法反映模型在降雨临近预报这种复杂实际场景中的能力，需要专门针对降雨特点的基准测试。

Method: 构建了基于5年气象观测数据的RainfallBench数据集，包含6个关键变量和PWV指标；设计了专门的评估策略；提出了BFPF插件模块，利用领域先验知识增强降雨时间序列预测。

Result: 在RainfallBench上评估了20多个最先进模型，涵盖6种主要架构；统计分析和消融研究验证了数据集的全面性和方法的优越性。

Conclusion: RainfallBench填补了降雨临近预报基准测试的空白，BFPF模块有效解决了降雨预测中的零膨胀和时间衰减问题，为复杂气象场景的模型评估提供了重要工具。

Abstract: Rainfall nowcasting, which aims to predict precipitation within the next 0 to
3 hours, is critical for disaster mitigation and real-time response planning.
However, most time series forecasting benchmarks in meteorology are evaluated
on variables with strong periodicity, such as temperature and humidity, which
fail to reflect model capabilities in more complex and practically meteorology
scenarios like rainfall nowcasting. To address this gap, we propose
RainfallBench, a benchmark designed for rainfall nowcasting, a highly
challenging and practically relevant task characterized by zero inflation,
temporal decay, and non-stationarity, focused on predicting precipitation
within the next 0 to 3 hours. The dataset is derived from five years of
meteorological observations, recorded at 15-minute intervals across six
essential variables, and collected from more than 12,000 GNSS stations
globally. In particular, it incorporates precipitable water vapor (PWV), a
crucial indicator of rainfall that is absent in other datasets. We further
design specialized evaluation strategies to assess model performance on key
meteorological challenges, such as multi-scale prediction and extreme rainfall
events, and evaluate over 20 state-of-the-art models across six major
architectures on RainfallBench. Additionally, to address the zero-inflation and
temporal decay issues overlooked by existing models, we introduce Bi-Focus
Precipitation Forecaster (BFPF), a plug-and-play module that incorporates
domain-specific priors to enhance rainfall time series forecasting. Statistical
analysis and ablation studies validate the comprehensiveness of our dataset as
well as the superiority of our methodology. Code and datasets are available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CPATTA是一种基于保形预测的主动测试时适应方法，通过引入有理论保证的不确定性度量来提升数据选择效率，在多个实验中比现有ATTA方法准确率提升约5%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的主动测试时适应方法使用启发式不确定性度量，数据选择效率低，浪费人工标注预算，需要更原则性的不确定性度量方法。

Method: 使用平滑保形分数和top-K确定性度量，基于伪覆盖率的在线权重更新算法，域偏移检测器自适应人类监督，以及平衡人工标注和模型标注数据的分阶段更新方案。

Result: 在广泛实验中，CPATTA持续优于最先进的ATTA方法，准确率提升约5%。

Conclusion: CPATTA成功将原则性的、覆盖保证的不确定性引入ATTA，显著提升了模型在域偏移下的鲁棒性和数据选择效率。

Abstract: Active Test-Time Adaptation (ATTA) improves model robustness under domain
shift by selectively querying human annotations at deployment, but existing
methods use heuristic uncertainty measures and suffer from low data selection
efficiency, wasting human annotation budget. We propose Conformal Prediction
Active TTA (CPATTA), which first brings principled, coverage-guaranteed
uncertainty into ATTA. CPATTA employs smoothed conformal scores with a top-K
certainty measure, an online weight-update algorithm driven by pseudo coverage,
a domain-shift detector that adapts human supervision, and a staged update
scheme balances human-labeled and model-labeled data. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that CPATTA consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art ATTA
methods by around 5% in accuracy. Our code and datasets are available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出UOT-RFM框架，通过无标签的逆重加权策略解决长尾分布中的多数类偏差问题，在保持平衡数据集性能的同时显著提升尾部类生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准流匹配在处理长尾分布时存在多数类偏差问题，导致少数类模式生成质量低且无法匹配真实类别比例。

Method: 使用小批量不平衡最优传输构建条件向量场，通过基于目标分布与UOT边缘密度比的无标签多数得分进行逆重加权。

Result: 在长尾基准测试中优于现有流匹配基线，同时在平衡数据集上保持竞争力。

Conclusion: UOT-RFM无需类别标签即可有效缓解多数类偏差，理论上能通过一阶校正恢复目标分布，实践中通过高阶校正进一步改善尾部类生成。

Abstract: Flow matching has recently emerged as a powerful framework for
continuous-time generative modeling. However, when applied to long-tailed
distributions, standard flow matching suffers from majority bias, producing
minority modes with low fidelity and failing to match the true class
proportions. In this work, we propose Unbalanced Optimal Transport Reweighted
Flow Matching (UOT-RFM), a novel framework for generative modeling under
class-imbalanced (long-tailed) distributions that operates without any class
label information. Our method constructs the conditional vector field using
mini-batch Unbalanced Optimal Transport (UOT) and mitigates majority bias
through a principled inverse reweighting strategy. The reweighting relies on a
label-free majority score, defined as the density ratio between the target
distribution and the UOT marginal. This score quantifies the degree of majority
based on the geometric structure of the data, without requiring class labels.
By incorporating this score into the training objective, UOT-RFM theoretically
recovers the target distribution with first-order correction ($k=1$) and
empirically improves tail-class generation through higher-order corrections ($k
> 1$). Our model outperforms existing flow matching baselines on long-tailed
benchmarks, while maintaining competitive performance on balanced datasets.

Motivation: 探索天气基础模型在电网关键基础设施中的实际应用价值，解决现有天气预报系统无法提供资产级、高精度预测，特别是覆冰风险预警的问题。

Method: 使用魁北克水电公司的资产观测数据（包括输电线路气象站、风电场测风塔和覆冰传感器）对Silurian AI的15亿参数生成式预报变换器模型进行微调，预测五个电网关键变量。

Result: 在6-72小时预报时效内，定制模型在温度平均绝对误差上降低15%，总降水量误差降低35%，风速误差降低15%，并在覆冰检测方面达到0.72的平均精度得分，提供了数小时的可操作预警时间。

Conclusion: 天气基础模型通过少量高保真数据的后训练，可以作为下一代电网韧性智能的实用基础，显著提升对关键天气事件的预测能力。

Abstract: Weather foundation models (WFMs) have recently set new benchmarks in global
forecast skill, yet their concrete value for the weather-sensitive
infrastructure that powers modern society remains largely unexplored. In this
study, we fine-tune Silurian AI's 1.5B-parameter WFM, Generative Forecasting
Transformer (GFT), on a rich archive of Hydro-Qu\'ebec asset
observations--including transmission-line weather stations, wind-farm met-mast
streams, and icing sensors--to deliver hyper-local, asset-level forecasts for
five grid-critical variables: surface temperature, precipitation, hub-height
wind speed, wind-turbine icing risk, and rime-ice accretion on overhead
conductors. Across 6-72 h lead times, the tailored model surpasses
state-of-the-art NWP benchmarks, trimming temperature mean absolute error (MAE)
by 15%, total-precipitation MAE by 35%, and lowering wind speed MAE by 15%.
Most importantly, it attains an average precision score of 0.72 for day-ahead
rime-ice detection, a capability absent from existing operational systems,
which affords several hours of actionable warning for potentially catastrophic
outage events. These results show that WFMs, when post-trained with small
amounts of high-fidelity, can serve as a practical foundation for
next-generation grid-resilience intelligence.

TL;DR: ClustRecNet是一个基于深度学习的推荐框架，用于为给定数据集推荐最合适的聚类算法，解决了无监督学习中聚类算法选择的长期挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决无监督学习中聚类算法选择的挑战，减少对手工元特征和传统聚类有效性指数的依赖。

Method: 构建包含34,000个合成数据集的综合数据仓库，使用10种流行聚类算法处理，通过调整兰德指数评估聚类结果建立真实标签。网络架构整合卷积、残差和注意力机制，捕捉输入数据的局部和全局结构模式，支持端到端训练学习数据集的紧凑表示。

Conclusion: ClustRecNet通过深度学习有效解决了聚类算法选择问题，显著优于传统方法和现有AutoML方法，为无监督学习中的算法选择提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce ClustRecNet - a novel deep learning (DL)-based recommendation
framework for determining the most suitable clustering algorithms for a given
dataset, addressing the long-standing challenge of clustering algorithm
selection in unsupervised learning. To enable supervised learning in this
context, we construct a comprehensive data repository comprising 34,000
synthetic datasets with diverse structural properties. Each of them was
processed using 10 popular clustering algorithms. The resulting clusterings
were assessed via the Adjusted Rand Index (ARI) to establish ground truth
labels, used for training and evaluation of our DL model. The proposed network
architecture integrates convolutional, residual, and attention mechanisms to
capture both local and global structural patterns from the input data. This
design supports end-to-end training to learn compact representations of
datasets and enables direct recommendation of the most suitable clustering
algorithm, reducing reliance on handcrafted meta-features and traditional
Cluster Validity Indices (CVIs). Comprehensive experiments across synthetic and
real-world benchmarks demonstrate that our DL model consistently outperforms
conventional CVIs (e.g. Silhouette, Calinski-Harabasz, Davies-Bouldin, and
Dunn) as well as state-of-the-art AutoML clustering recommendation approaches
(e.g. ML2DAC, AutoCluster, and AutoML4Clust). Notably, the proposed model
achieves a 0.497 ARI improvement over the Calinski-Harabasz index on synthetic
data and a 15.3% ARI gain over the best-performing AutoML approach on
real-world data.

Conclusion: DLGNs可以扩展到大规模多类分类任务，温度调优对输出层性能有重要影响，Group-Sum层在特定条件下能有效处理多达2000类的分类问题。

Abstract: Differentiable Logic Gate Networks (DLGNs) are a very fast and
energy-efficient alternative to conventional feed-forward networks. With
learnable combinations of logical gates, DLGNs enable fast inference by
hardware-friendly execution. Since the concept of DLGNs has only recently
gained attention, these networks are still in their developmental infancy,
including the design and scalability of their output layer. To date, this
architecture has primarily been tested on datasets with up to ten classes.
  This work examines the behavior of DLGNs on large multi-class datasets. We
investigate its general expressiveness, its scalability, and evaluate
alternative output strategies. Using both synthetic and real-world datasets, we
provide key insights into the importance of temperature tuning and its impact
on output layer performance. We evaluate conditions under which the Group-Sum
layer performs well and how it can be applied to large-scale classification of
up to 2000 classes.

Method: 基于54个实验，系统分析模型规模、数据量和计算预算在RL后训练中的交互作用，涵盖不同模型大小和训练设置。

Result: 发现四个关键结论：大模型在固定计算预算下表现更优；大模型样本效率更高；数据受限时重复使用高质量数据有效；这些缩放规律在不同类型模型中具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 这些结果为通过RL后训练高效扩展LLM推理能力提供了理论基础和实践指导。

Abstract: While scaling laws for large language models (LLMs) during pre-training have
been extensively studied, their behavior under reinforcement learning (RL)
post-training remains largely unexplored. This paper presents a systematic
empirical investigation of scaling behaviors in RL-based post-training, with a
particular focus on mathematical reasoning. Based on 54 experiments across
diverse model sizes and training settings, we characterize how model scale,
data volume, and computational budget interact to shape performance. Our
analysis leads to four key findings: (1). Under a fixed computational budget,
larger models trained for fewer steps consistently outperform smaller models
trained for more steps. (2). Given a fixed amount of training data, larger
models achieve superior sample efficiency, yielding lower loss. (3). In
data-constrained regimes, repeated reuse of high-quality data proves highly
effective, as final performance is primarily governed by the total number of
optimization steps rather than the uniqueness of samples. (4). These scaling
behaviors are robust across both base and instruction-tuned models, which share
similar learning dynamics (e.g., larger models show faster convergence) even
while differing in absolute accuracy. Collectively, these results provide a
principled foundation and practical guidelines for efficiently scaling the
reasoning capabilities of LLMs through RL post-training.

TL;DR: 提出了LEO-CVAE框架，通过局部熵引导的CVAE进行过采样，解决了类别不平衡问题，特别针对高维生物医学数据中的非线性流形结构。


<details>

Motivation: 传统过采样方法如SMOTE依赖局部线性插值，常产生不合理的合成样本；而标准CVAE对所有少数类样本一视同仁，忽略了边界区域不确定样本的重要性。

Method: LEO-CVAE通过计算样本邻域的香农熵来量化不确定性，使用局部熵加权损失强调不确定区域的鲁棒学习，并采用熵引导的采样策略在信息丰富的类重叠区域集中生成样本。

Result: 在临床基因组数据集（ADNI和TCGA肺癌）上的实验表明，LEO-CVAE持续提升分类器性能，优于传统过采样和生成基线方法。

Conclusion: 结果表明，对于由复杂非线性结构主导的领域（如组学数据），不确定性感知的生成过采样在非平衡学习中具有重要价值。

Abstract: Class imbalance remains a major challenge in machine learning, especially for
high-dimensional biomedical data where nonlinear manifold structures dominate.
Traditional oversampling methods such as SMOTE rely on local linear
interpolation, often producing implausible synthetic samples. Deep generative
models like Conditional Variational Autoencoders (CVAEs) better capture
nonlinear distributions, but standard variants treat all minority samples
equally, neglecting the importance of uncertain, boundary-region examples
emphasized by heuristic methods like Borderline-SMOTE and ADASYN.
  We propose Local Entropy-Guided Oversampling with a CVAE (LEO-CVAE), a
generative oversampling framework that explicitly incorporates local
uncertainty into both representation learning and data generation. To quantify
uncertainty, we compute Shannon entropy over the class distribution in a
sample's neighborhood: high entropy indicates greater class overlap, serving as
a proxy for uncertainty. LEO-CVAE leverages this signal through two mechanisms:
(i) a Local Entropy-Weighted Loss (LEWL) that emphasizes robust learning in
uncertain regions, and (ii) an entropy-guided sampling strategy that
concentrates generation in these informative, class-overlapping areas.
  Applied to clinical genomics datasets (ADNI and TCGA lung cancer), LEO-CVAE
consistently improves classifier performance, outperforming both traditional
oversampling and generative baselines. These results highlight the value of
uncertainty-aware generative oversampling for imbalanced learning in domains
governed by complex nonlinear structures, such as omics data.

Motivation: 现有方法将空间单元独立处理，忽略了城市结构中的关系信息，需要开发能够显式整合局部地理上下文的非正式住区检测方法。

Method: 构建图结构将每个空间单元与其相邻单元连接，使用轻量级图卷积网络进行分类，通过空间交叉验证确保模型在不同区域的泛化能力。

Abstract: Mapping informal settlements is crucial for addressing challenges related to
urban planning, public health, and infrastructure in rapidly growing cities.
Geospatial machine learning has emerged as a key tool for detecting and mapping
these areas from remote sensing data. However, existing approaches often treat
spatial units independently, neglecting the relational structure of the urban
fabric. We propose a graph-based framework that explicitly incorporates local
geographical context into the classification process. Each spatial unit (cell)
is embedded in a graph structure along with its adjacent neighbors, and a
lightweight Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) is trained to classify whether
the central cell belongs to an informal settlement. Experiments are conducted
on a case study in Rio de Janeiro using spatial cross-validation across five
distinct zones, ensuring robustness and generalizability across heterogeneous
urban landscapes. Our method outperforms standard baselines, improving Kappa
coefficient by 17 points over individual cell classification. We also show that
graph-based modeling surpasses simple feature concatenation of neighboring
cells, demonstrating the benefit of encoding spatial structure for urban scene
understanding.

Method: 使用ROBOD数据集，比较LSTM、GRU和CNN-LSTM三种深度学习架构在不同时间跨度下预测IEQ参数的性能。

Result: GRU在短期预测中精度最高且计算开销较小，CNN-LSTM在提取特征进行长期预测方面表现优异，LSTM在长期时间建模方面稳健。预测可靠性受数据分辨率、传感器位置和人员流动影响。

Conclusion: 研究结果为智能建筑管理系统提供了可操作的见解，有助于实现预测性HVAC控制，在实际建筑运营中降低能耗并提升居住者舒适度。

Abstract: Ensuring optimal Indoor Environmental Quality (IEQ) is vital for occupant
health and productivity, yet it often comes at a high energy cost in
conventional Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems. This
paper proposes a deep learning driven approach to proactively manage IEQ
parameters specifically CO2 concentration, temperature, and humidity while
balancing building energy efficiency. Leveraging the ROBOD dataset collected
from a net-zero energy academic building, we benchmark three
architectures--Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Gated Recurrent Units (GRU), and
a hybrid Convolutional Neural Network LSTM (CNN-LSTM)--to forecast IEQ
variables across various time horizons. Our results show that GRU achieves the
best short-term prediction accuracy with lower computational overhead, whereas
CNN-LSTM excels in extracting dominant features for extended forecasting
windows. Meanwhile, LSTM offers robust long-range temporal modeling. The
comparative analysis highlights that prediction reliability depends on data
resolution, sensor placement, and fluctuating occupancy conditions. These
findings provide actionable insights for intelligent Building Management
Systems (BMS) to implement predictive HVAC control, thereby reducing energy
consumption and enhancing occupant comfort in real-world building operations.

Conclusion: 所提出的覆盖感知方法在冷启动主动相关性聚类中表现有效，能够通过鼓励早期多样性来改善聚类性能。

Abstract: We study active correlation clustering where pairwise similarities are not
provided upfront and must be queried in a cost-efficient manner through active
learning. Specifically, we focus on the cold-start scenario, where no true
initial pairwise similarities are available for active learning. To address
this challenge, we propose a coverage-aware method that encourages diversity
early in the process. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through
several synthetic and real-world experiments.

Abstract: Protein structure prediction and folding are fundamental to understanding
biology, with recent deep learning advances reshaping the field.
Diffusion-based generative models have revolutionized protein design, enabling
the creation of novel proteins. However, these methods often neglect the
intrinsic physical realism of proteins, driven by noising dynamics that lack
grounding in physical principles. To address this, we first introduce a
physically motivated non-linear noising process, grounded in classical physics,
that unfolds proteins into secondary structures (e.g., alpha helices, linear
beta sheets) while preserving topological integrity--maintaining bonds, and
preventing collisions. We then integrate this process with the flow-matching
paradigm on SE(3) to model the invariant distribution of protein backbones with
high fidelity, incorporating sequence information to enable
sequence-conditioned folding and expand the generative capabilities of our
model. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves
state-of-the-art performance in unconditional protein generation, producing
more designable and novel protein structures while accurately folding monomer
sequences into precise protein conformations.

*Liang Qiao,Yue Dai,Yeqi Huang,Hongyu Kan,Jun Shi,Hong An*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FlashOmni是一个统一的稀疏注意力引擎，通过灵活的稀疏符号标准化各种稀疏策略表示，在单个注意力核中执行多样化稀疏计算，显著提升多模态扩散变换器的推理效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态扩散变换器(DiTs)在视觉合成方面表现出色，但计算需求巨大。现有的稀疏加速方法需要定制化内核，限制了通用性。

Method: 提出FlashOmni统一稀疏注意力引擎，引入灵活稀疏符号标准化稀疏策略表示，设计优化的稀疏GEMMs消除冗余计算。

Result: FlashOmni在注意力和GEMM-Q中实现接近线性的加速比(1:1)，在GEMM-O中达到2.5-3.8倍加速，最高达到理论极限的87.5%。应用多粒度稀疏策略使Hunyuan模型(33K)实现约1.5倍端到端加速且不降低视觉质量。

Conclusion: FlashOmni提供了一个通用的稀疏计算框架，有效解决了DiTs部署中的计算瓶颈问题，为多模态扩散模型的实用化部署提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Multi-Modal Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) demonstrate exceptional
capabilities in visual synthesis, yet their deployment remains constrained by
substantial computational demands. To alleviate this bottleneck, many
sparsity-based acceleration methods have been proposed. However, their diverse
sparsity patterns often require customized kernels for high-performance
inference, limiting universality. We propose FlashOmni, a unified sparse
attention engine compatible with arbitrary DiT architectures. FlashOmni
introduces flexible sparse symbols to standardize the representation of a wide
range of sparsity strategies, such as feature caching and block-sparse
skipping. This unified abstraction enables the execution of diverse sparse
computations within a single attention kernel. In addition, FlashOmni designs
optimized sparse GEMMs for attention blocks, leveraging sparse symbols to
eliminate redundant computations and further improve efficiency. Experiments
demonstrate that FlashOmni delivers near-linear, closely matching the sparsity
ratio speedup (1:1) in attention and GEMM-$Q$, and achieves
2.5$\times$-3.8$\times$ acceleration in GEMM-$O$ (max peaking at about 87.5% of
the theoretical limit). Applied with a multi-granularity sparsity strategy, it
enables the Hunyuan model (33K) to achieve about 1.5$\times$ end-to-end
acceleration without degrading visual quality.

*Jubayer Ibn Hamid,Ifdita Hasan Orney,Ellen Xu,Chelsea Finn,Dorsa Sadigh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为polychromic objective的新目标函数，用于解决强化学习微调中策略多样性丧失的问题，通过改进PPO算法来保持和利用多样化的策略库。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RLFT方法在微调预训练策略时容易导致策略多样性丧失，收敛到少数易被利用的输出，这阻碍了探索和测试时计算扩展的效益。

Method: 引入polychromic目标函数，使用vine采样收集策略rollouts，并修改优势函数来反映新目标下的优势，通过改进PPO算法来优化这一目标。

Result: 在BabyAI、Minigrid和Algorithmic Creativity上的实验表明，该方法提高了成功率，能可靠解决更多环境配置，在大的扰动下泛化更好，在pass@k实验中实现了更高的覆盖率。

Conclusion: polychromic objective方法能有效保持策略多样性，提升强化学习微调的性能和泛化能力，特别是在需要多样化策略的场景中表现优异。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning fine-tuning (RLFT) is a dominant paradigm for
improving pretrained policies for downstream tasks. These pretrained policies,
trained on large datasets, produce generations with a broad range of promising
but unrefined behaviors. Often, a critical failure mode of RLFT arises when
policies lose this diversity and collapse into a handful of easily exploitable
outputs. This convergence hinders exploration, which is essential for expanding
the capabilities of the pretrained policy and for amplifying the benefits of
test-time compute scaling. To address this, we introduce an objective for
policy gradient methods that explicitly enforces the exploration and refinement
of diverse generations, which we call a polychromic objective. We then show how
proximal policy optimization (PPO) can be adapted to optimize this objective.
Our method (1) employs vine sampling to collect on-policy rollouts and (2)
modifies the advantage function to reflect the advantage under our new
objective. Experiments on BabyAI, Minigrid, and Algorithmic Creativity show
that our method improves success rates by reliably solving a larger set of
environment configurations and generalizes better under large perturbations.
Moreover, when given multiple attempts in pass@$k$ experiments, the policy
achieves substantially higher coverage, demonstrating its ability to maintain
and exploit a diverse repertoire of strategies.

### [445] [Beyond Noisy-TVs: Noise-Robust Exploration Via Learning Progress Monitoring](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25438)
*Zhibo Hou,Zhiyu An,Wan Du*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为学习进度监控（LPM）的新方法，通过奖励模型改进而非预测误差或新颖性来指导探索，有效避免智能体陷入不可学习的噪声源（如noisy-TV问题）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统内在奖励方法在存在不可学习随机源（noisy-TV）时，智能体会被卡住的问题，以及基于不确定性估计或分布相似性的方法样本效率低、计算成本高的问题。

Method: 采用双网络设计：使用误差模型预测动态模型在上一迭代中的预期预测误差，利用当前迭代与上一迭代模型误差的差异来指导探索。

Result: 在基于MNIST、3D迷宫和Atari的噪声环境中，LPM的内在奖励收敛更快，在迷宫实验中探索更多状态，在Atari中获得更高的外在奖励。

Conclusion: LPM提供了一种概念简单但有效的噪声鲁棒探索方法，标志着探索范式的转变。

Abstract: When there exists an unlearnable source of randomness (noisy-TV) in the
environment, a naively intrinsic reward driven exploring agent gets stuck at
that source of randomness and fails at exploration. Intrinsic reward based on
uncertainty estimation or distribution similarity, while eventually escapes
noisy-TVs as time unfolds, suffers from poor sample efficiency and high
computational cost. Inspired by recent findings from neuroscience that humans
monitor their improvements during exploration, we propose a novel method for
intrinsically-motivated exploration, named Learning Progress Monitoring (LPM).
During exploration, LPM rewards model improvements instead of prediction error
or novelty, effectively rewards the agent for observing learnable transitions
rather than the unlearnable transitions. We introduce a dual-network design
that uses an error model to predict the expected prediction error of the
dynamics model in its previous iteration, and use the difference between the
model errors of the current iteration and previous iteration to guide
exploration. We theoretically show that the intrinsic reward of LPM is
zero-equivariant and a monotone indicator of Information Gain (IG), and that
the error model is necessary to achieve monotonicity correspondence with IG. We
empirically compared LPM against state-of-the-art baselines in noisy
environments based on MNIST, 3D maze with 160x120 RGB inputs, and Atari.
Results show that LPM's intrinsic reward converges faster, explores more states
in the maze experiment, and achieves higher extrinsic reward in Atari. This
conceptually simple approach marks a shift-of-paradigm of noise-robust
exploration. For code to reproduce our experiments, see

Conclusion: 这项工作为基于联合嵌入开发未来时间序列基础模型奠定了基础，展示了其作为学习通用表示的稳健基础模型的潜力。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning has seen great success recently in unsupervised
representation learning, enabling breakthroughs in natural language and image
processing. However, these methods often rely on autoregressive and masked
modeling, which aim to reproduce masked information in the input, which can be
vulnerable to the presence of noise or confounding variables. To address this
problem, Joint-Embedding Predictive Architectures (JEPA) has been introduced
with the aim to perform self-supervised learning in the latent space. To
leverage these advancements in the domain of time series, we introduce Time
Series JEPA (TS-JEPA), an architecture specifically adapted for time series
representation learning. We validate TS-JEPA on both classification and
forecasting, showing that it can match or surpass current state-of-the-art
baselines on different standard datasets. Notably, our approach demonstrates a
strong performance balance across diverse tasks, indicating its potential as a
robust foundation for learning general representations. Thus, this work lays
the groundwork for developing future time series foundation models based on
Joint Embedding.

Method: 使用性能感知调度策略，基于卡尔曼滤波器估计器跟踪每个任务从数据中获益的程度，从而智能分配额外演示数据。

Result: 在MetaWorld和IsaacLab抽屉开启任务套件上验证，获得高性能的同时显著减少专家演示需求，仿真学习的视觉策略在零样本迁移到真实机器人时表现优于朴素DAgger和行为克隆。

Conclusion: 该方法能够高效学习多任务策略，在减少数据需求的同时保持高性能，并具有良好的零样本迁移能力。

Abstract: Generalist robot policies that can perform many tasks typically require
extensive expert data or simulations for training. In this work, we propose a
novel Data-Efficient multitask DAgger framework that distills a single
multitask policy from multiple task-specific expert policies. Our approach
significantly increases the overall task success rate by actively focusing on
tasks where the multitask policy underperforms. The core of our method is a
performance-aware scheduling strategy that tracks how much each task's learning
process benefits from the amount of data, using a Kalman filter-based estimator
to robustly decide how to allocate additional demonstrations across tasks. We
validate our approach on MetaWorld, as well as a suite of diverse
drawer-opening tasks in IsaacLab. The resulting policy attains high performance
across all tasks while using substantially fewer expert demonstrations, and the
visual policy learned with our method in simulation shows better performance
than naive DAgger and Behavior Cloning when transferring zero-shot to a real
robot without using real data.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: P2Es是一个基于扩散模型的创新框架，能够从PPG信号生成临床有效的12导联心电图，通过频域模糊、时间噪声干扰和人口统计信息感知等技术实现高质量ECG重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有12导联ECG系统依赖笨重的多电极设置，限制了移动环境下的持续监测，而当前的PPG方法由于缺乏导联间约束和时空依赖性建模不足，无法重建多导联ECG。

Method: 提出P2Es框架，包含三个关键创新：前向过程使用频域模糊和时间噪声干扰模拟真实信号失真；反向过程设计时间多尺度生成模块和频率去模糊；利用KNN聚类和对比学习为反向过程分配亲和矩阵，实现人口统计特定的ECG转换。

Result: 广泛的实验结果表明，P2Es在12导联ECG重建方面优于基线模型。

Conclusion: P2Es能够从PPG信号生成临床有效的12导联ECG，为移动健康监测提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: The 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) is the gold standard for cardiovascular
monitoring, offering superior diagnostic granularity and specificity compared
to photoplethysmography (PPG). However, existing 12-lead ECG systems rely on
cumbersome multi-electrode setups, limiting sustained monitoring in ambulatory
settings, while current PPG-based methods fail to reconstruct multi-lead ECG
due to the absence of inter-lead constraints and insufficient modeling of
spatial-temporal dependencies across leads. To bridge this gap, we introduce
P2Es, an innovative demographic-aware diffusion framework designed to generate
clinically valid 12-lead ECG from PPG signals via three key innovations.
Specifically, in the forward process, we introduce frequency-domain blurring
followed by temporal noise interference to simulate real-world signal
distortions. In the reverse process, we design a temporal multi-scale
generation module followed by frequency deblurring. In particular, we leverage
KNN-based clustering combined with contrastive learning to assign affinity
matrices for the reverse process, enabling demographic-specific ECG
translation. Extensive experimental results show that P2Es outperforms baseline
models in 12-lead ECG reconstruction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式AI在解决科学逆向设计问题时既带来机遇也带来风险，虽然能自主扩展和优化搜索空间，但会在低质量区域探索直到充分调优，这浪费了计算资源。

Method: 提出了一种队列优先级算法，将生成建模与主动学习结合在分布式工作流中，使用主动学习模型优先处理顶级设计候选，防止生成式AI工作流在无意义候选上浪费资源。

Result: 在碳捕获分子结构发现任务中，使用主动学习的方法将高质量候选分子数量从平均281个显著提升到604个（从1000个新候选分子中）。

Conclusion: 结合主动学习的优先级算法能有效防止生成模型衰减，显著提高生成式AI工作流在复杂设计空间探索中的效率和质量。

Abstract: Generative AI poses both opportunities and risks for solving inverse design
problems in the sciences. Generative tools provide the ability to expand and
refine a search space autonomously, but do so at the cost of exploring
low-quality regions until sufficiently fine tuned. Here, we propose a queue
prioritization algorithm that combines generative modeling and active learning
in the context of a distributed workflow for exploring complex design spaces.
We find that incorporating an active learning model to prioritize top design
candidates can prevent a generative AI workflow from expending resources on
nonsensical candidates and halt potential generative model decay. For an
existing generative AI workflow for discovering novel molecular structure
candidates for carbon capture, our active learning approach significantly
increases the number of high-quality candidates identified by the generative
model. We find that, out of 1000 novel candidates, our workflow without active
learning can generate an average of 281 high-performing candidates, while our
proposed prioritization with active learning can generate an average 604
high-performing candidates.

Conclusion: 该方法在检测细微频率和电压偏差方面表现优异，展示了在不依赖手动标记故障数据的情况下进行实时广域监控的实用价值。

Abstract: Ensuring power grid resilience requires the timely and unsupervised detection
of anomalies in synchrophasor data streams. We introduce T-BiGAN, a novel
framework that integrates window-attention Transformers within a bidirectional
Generative Adversarial Network (BiGAN) to address this challenge. Its
self-attention encoder-decoder architecture captures complex spatio-temporal
dependencies across the grid, while a joint discriminator enforces cycle
consistency to align the learned latent space with the true data distribution.
Anomalies are flagged in real-time using an adaptive score that combines
reconstruction error, latent space drift, and discriminator confidence.
Evaluated on a realistic hardware-in-the-loop PMU benchmark, T-BiGAN achieves
an ROC-AUC of 0.95 and an average precision of 0.996, significantly
outperforming leading supervised and unsupervised methods. It shows particular
strength in detecting subtle frequency and voltage deviations, demonstrating
its practical value for live, wide-area monitoring without relying on manually
labeled fault data.

Conclusion: BaB-prob为前馈ReLU神经网络提供了完整且可靠的验证框架，在概率验证任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Branch-and-bound with preactivation splitting has been shown highly effective
for deterministic verification of neural networks. In this paper, we extend
this framework to the probabilistic setting. We propose BaB-prob that
iteratively divides the original problem into subproblems by splitting
preactivations and leverages linear bounds computed by linear bound propagation
to bound the probability for each subproblem. We prove soundness and
completeness of BaB-prob for feedforward-ReLU neural networks. Furthermore, we
introduce the notion of uncertainty level and design two efficient strategies
for preactivation splitting, yielding BaB-prob-ordered and BaB+BaBSR-prob. We
evaluate BaB-prob on untrained networks, MNIST and CIFAR-10 models,
respectively, and VNN-COMP 2025 benchmarks. Across these settings, our approach
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in medium- to
high-dimensional input problems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于序列模型的方法对回报到目标和成本到目标使用对称输入标记条件化，忽略了它们内在的不对称性：回报到目标是灵活的性能目标，而成本到目标应代表严格的安全边界，这导致不可靠的约束满足。

Method: 提出Boundary-to-Region框架，通过成本信号重新对齐实现非对称条件化，将成本到目标重新定义为固定安全预算下的边界约束，统一所有可行轨迹的成本分布，同时结合旋转位置嵌入增强安全区域内的探索。

Conclusion: 这项工作揭示了对称标记条件化的局限性，为将序列模型应用于安全强化学习建立了新的理论和实践方法。

Abstract: Offline safe reinforcement learning aims to learn policies that satisfy
predefined safety constraints from static datasets. Existing
sequence-model-based methods condition action generation on symmetric input
tokens for return-to-go and cost-to-go, neglecting their intrinsic asymmetry:
return-to-go (RTG) serves as a flexible performance target, while cost-to-go
(CTG) should represent a rigid safety boundary. This symmetric conditioning
leads to unreliable constraint satisfaction, especially when encountering
out-of-distribution cost trajectories. To address this, we propose
Boundary-to-Region (B2R), a framework that enables asymmetric conditioning
through cost signal realignment . B2R redefines CTG as a boundary constraint
under a fixed safety budget, unifying the cost distribution of all feasible
trajectories while preserving reward structures. Combined with rotary
positional embeddings , it enhances exploration within the safe region.
Experimental results show that B2R satisfies safety constraints in 35 out of 38
safety-critical tasks while achieving superior reward performance over baseline
methods. This work highlights the limitations of symmetric token conditioning
and establishes a new theoretical and practical approach for applying sequence
models to safe RL. Our code is available at https://github.com/HuikangSu/B2R.

TL;DR: 提出了一种自主感知聚类框架，通过强化学习和确定性退火结合，学习并考虑实体局部自主性对聚类结果的影响，无需预先知道自主性形式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统聚类方法假设实体是被动的，但现实中实体具有局部自主性，会以特征表示无法完全捕捉的方式覆盖预设关联，这会显著改变聚类组成、几何结构和基数。

Method: 将强化学习与确定性退火过程集成，退火过程早期促进探索，后期转向利用；提出自适应距离估计网络（ADEN），基于Transformer的注意力模型，学习实体与聚类代表之间的依赖关系。

Result: 即使没有显式自主性模型，该框架也能接近真实情况（差距约3-4%），而忽略自主性会导致较大差距（约35-40%）。

Conclusion: 自主感知聚类框架能有效捕捉底层数据动态，显著优于忽略自主性的传统方法。

Abstract: Clustering arises in a wide range of problem formulations, yet most existing
approaches assume that the entities under clustering are passive and strictly
conform to their assigned groups. In reality, entities often exhibit local
autonomy, overriding prescribed associations in ways not fully captured by
feature representations. Such autonomy can substantially reshape clustering
outcomes -- altering cluster compositions, geometry, and cardinality -- with
significant downstream effects on inference and decision-making. We introduce
autonomy-aware clustering, a reinforcement (RL) learning framework that learns
and accounts for the influence of local autonomy without requiring prior
knowledge of its form. Our approach integrates RL with a deterministic
annealing (DA) procedure, where, to determine underlying clusters, DA naturally
promotes exploration in early stages of annealing and transitions to
exploitation later. We also show that the annealing procedure exhibits phase
transitions that enable design of efficient annealing schedules. To further
enhance adaptability, we propose the Adaptive Distance Estimation Network
(ADEN), a transformer-based attention model that learns dependencies between
entities and cluster representatives within the RL loop, accommodates
variable-sized inputs and outputs, and enables knowledge transfer across
diverse problem instances. Empirical results show that our framework closely
aligns with underlying data dynamics: even without explicit autonomy models, it
achieves solutions close to the ground truth (gap ~3-4%), whereas ignoring
autonomy leads to substantially larger gaps (~35-40%). The code and data are
publicly available at https://github.com/salar96/AutonomyAwareClustering.

rate (RMSE, MAE) measures. In addition, SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)
was used to ascertain model explainability and clinical relevance. The
CardioForest model performed best on all metrics, achieving a test accuracy of
94.95%, a balanced accuracy of 88.31%, and high precision and recall metrics.
SHAP analysis confirmed the model's ability to rank the most relevant ECG
features, such as QRS duration, in accordance with clinical intuitions, thereby
fostering trust and usability in clinical practice. The findings recognize
CardioForest as an extremely dependable and interpretable WCT detection model.
Being able to offer accurate predictions and transparency through
explainability makes it a valuable tool to help cardiologists make timely and
well-informed diagnoses, especially for high-stakes and emergency scenarios.

### [456] [Distillation of Large Language Models via Concrete Score Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25837)
*Yeongmin Kim,Donghyeok Shin,Mina Kang,Byeonghu Na,Il-Chul Moon*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Concrete Score Distillation (CSD)方法，通过离散分数匹配克服软最大平滑和最优解集限制，在LLM知识蒸馏中实现更好的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有知识蒸馏方法使用softmax匹配概率会模糊有价值的logit信息，而直接logit蒸馏又无法处理logit平移不变性，限制了解决方案空间。

Method: 提出CSD方法，解决自回归LLM中离散分数匹配的训练不稳定性和二次复杂度问题，使学生的相对logit差异与教师在所有词汇对中保持一致。

Result: 在GPT-2-1.5B、OpenLLaMA-7B和GEMMA-7B-IT上的实验表明，CSD持续超越现有KD目标，实现更好的保真度-多样性权衡，并与在线策略技术结合获得互补收益。

Conclusion: CSD展示了在LLM蒸馏中的可扩展性和有效性，为知识蒸馏提供了新的优化方向。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) deliver remarkable performance but are costly to
deploy, motivating knowledge distillation (KD) for efficient inference.
Existing KD objectives typically match student and teacher probabilities via
softmax, which blurs valuable logit information. While direct logit
distillation (DLD) mitigates softmax smoothing, it fails to account for logit
shift invariance, thereby restricting the solution space. We propose Concrete
Score Distillation (CSD), a discrete score-matching objective that overcomes
both softmax-induced smoothing and restrictions on the optimal solution set. We
resolve the training instability and quadratic complexity of discrete
score-matching in autoregressive LLMs, and the resulting CSD objective aligns
relative logit differences across all vocabulary pairs between student and
teacher with flexible weighting. We provide both mode-seeking and mode-covering
instances within our framework and evaluate CSD on task-agnostic
instruction-following and task-specific distillation using GPT-2-1.5B,
OpenLLaMA-7B, and GEMMA-7B-IT. Experiments show that CSD consistently surpasses
recent KD objectives, achieves favorable fidelity-diversity trade-offs, and
yields complementary gains when combined with on-policy techniques,
demonstrating its scalability and effectiveness for LLM distillation.

*Suping Xu,Chuyi Dai,Ye Liu,Lin Shang,Xibei Yang,Witold Pedrycz*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种面向模糊决策系统的空间感知可分离性特征选择方法(S²FS)，通过结合空间方向信息来提升分类边界清晰度，在分类和聚类任务中优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有特征选择方法要么无法直接与学习性能对齐，要么仅使用非方向性欧氏距离来捕捉决策类间关系，限制了决策边界清晰度的提升。实例的空间分布对边界清晰度有潜在影响。

Method: 提出空间感知可分离性准则，同时考虑类内紧凑性和类间分离性，整合标量距离与空间方向信息。采用前向贪心策略迭代选择最具判别性的特征。

Result: 在10个真实数据集上的实验表明，S²FS在分类准确率和聚类性能上一致优于8种最先进的特征选择算法，特征可视化进一步证实了所选特征的可解释性。

Conclusion: S²FS通过空间感知的可分离性准则有效提升了模糊决策系统的特征选择性能，在保持可解释性的同时显著改善了预测性能。

Abstract: Feature selection is crucial for fuzzy decision systems (FDSs), as it
identifies informative features and eliminates rule redundancy, thereby
enhancing predictive performance and interpretability. Most existing methods
either fail to directly align evaluation criteria with learning performance or
rely solely on non-directional Euclidean distances to capture relationships
among decision classes, which limits their ability to clarify decision
boundaries. However, the spatial distribution of instances has a potential
impact on the clarity of such boundaries. Motivated by this, we propose
Spatially-aware Separability-driven Feature Selection (S$^2$FS), a novel
framework for FDSs guided by a spatially-aware separability criterion. This
criterion jointly considers within-class compactness and between-class
separation by integrating scalar-distances with spatial directional
information, providing a more comprehensive characterization of class
structures. S$^2$FS employs a forward greedy strategy to iteratively select the
most discriminative features. Extensive experiments on ten real-world datasets
demonstrate that S$^2$FS consistently outperforms eight state-of-the-art
feature selection algorithms in both classification accuracy and clustering
performance, while feature visualizations further confirm the interpretability
of the selected features.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ExploRLer是一个可插拔的管道，通过在策略梯度更新的未探索邻域进行系统探测，显著提升了PPO和TRPO等策略梯度方法的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的策略梯度方法如PPO通常沿着单一随机梯度方向更新，忽略了参数空间的丰富局部结构。研究发现代理梯度与真实奖励环境相关性较差，且更高性能的解往往位于附近未探索区域。

Method: 引入ExploRLer管道，与PPO、TRPO等策略算法无缝集成，系统性地探测代理策略梯度更新的未探索邻域，在不增加梯度更新次数的情况下提升性能。

Result: 在复杂连续控制环境中，ExploRLer相比基线方法取得了显著改进。

Conclusion: 迭代级探索为增强策略强化学习提供了实用有效的方法，并为代理目标的局限性提供了新的视角。

Abstract: Policy-gradient methods such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) are
typically updated along a single stochastic gradient direction, leaving the
rich local structure of the parameter space unexplored. Previous work has shown
that the surrogate gradient is often poorly correlated with the true reward
landscape. Building on this insight, we visualize the parameter space spanned
by policy checkpoints within an iteration and reveal that higher performing
solutions often lie in nearby unexplored regions. To exploit this opportunity,
we introduce ExploRLer, a pluggable pipeline that seamlessly integrates with
on-policy algorithms such as PPO and TRPO, systematically probing the
unexplored neighborhoods of surrogate on-policy gradient updates. Without
increasing the number of gradient updates, ExploRLer achieves significant
improvements over baselines in complex continuous control environments. Our
results demonstrate that iteration-level exploration provides a practical and
effective way to strengthen on-policy reinforcement learning and offer a fresh
perspective on the limitations of the surrogate objective.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多任务学习中存在破坏性梯度干扰问题，特别是在数据稀缺的药物发现场景下，这限制了多属性分子设计的效率。

Method: AIM框架学习动态策略来调解梯度冲突，通过包含密集可微分正则化器的新增目标函数与主网络联合训练，产生几何稳定且动态高效的更新。

Result: 在QM9和靶向蛋白质降解剂基准测试的子集上，AIM相比多任务基线实现了统计显著改进，在数据稀缺场景中优势最明显。

Conclusion: AIM结合了数据高效性能和诊断洞察，展示了自适应优化器通过创建更鲁棒和可解释的多属性分子设计模型来加速科学发现的潜力。

Abstract: Simultaneously optimizing multiple, frequently conflicting, molecular
properties is a key bottleneck in the development of novel therapeutics.
Although a promising approach, the efficacy of multi-task learning is often
compromised by destructive gradient interference, especially in the data-scarce
regimes common to drug discovery. To address this, we propose AIM, an
optimization framework that learns a dynamic policy to mediate gradient
conflicts. The policy is trained jointly with the main network using a novel
augmented objective composed of dense, differentiable regularizers. This
objective guides the policy to produce updates that are geometrically stable
and dynamically efficient, prioritizing progress on the most challenging tasks.
We demonstrate that AIM achieves statistically significant improvements over
multi-task baselines on subsets of the QM9 and targeted protein degraders
benchmarks, with its advantage being most pronounced in data-scarce regimes.
Beyond performance, AIM's key contribution is its interpretability; the learned
policy matrix serves as a diagnostic tool for analyzing inter-task
relationships. This combination of data-efficient performance and diagnostic
insight highlights the potential of adaptive optimizers to accelerate
scientific discovery by creating more robust and insightful models for
multi-property molecular design.

Motivation: 传统联邦学习面临数据异构、模型异构、灾难性遗忘和知识错位等挑战，特别是在新数据不断涌现和模型多样性增加的动态环境中，需要解决这些问题以提升联邦学习的实用性和泛化能力。

Method: 利用预训练扩散模型提取轻量级类特定原型，实现三重数据无关优势：生成当前任务的合成数据以增强训练；实现无示例生成回放以保留先前任务知识；实现从异构客户端到服务器的数据无关动态知识迁移。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验结果表明FedDCL具有有效性，展示了其在动态环境中增强联邦学习泛化能力和实际应用潜力的潜力。

Conclusion: FedDCL框架通过数据无关的持续学习方法成功解决了联邦学习中的关键挑战，为动态环境下的联邦学习提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a distributed learning paradigm across multiple
entities while preserving data privacy. However, with the continuous emergence
of new data and increasing model diversity, traditional federated learning
faces significant challenges, including inherent issues of data heterogeneity,
model heterogeneity and catastrophic forgetting, along with new challenge of
knowledge misalignment. In this study, we introduce FedDCL, a novel framework
designed to enable data-free continual learning of the server model in a
model-heterogeneous federated setting. We leverage pre-trained diffusion models
to extract lightweight class-specific prototypes, which confer a threefold
data-free advantage, enabling: (1) generation of synthetic data for the current
task to augment training and counteract non-IID data distributions; (2)
exemplar-free generative replay for retaining knowledge from previous tasks;
and (3) data-free dynamic knowledge transfer from heterogeneous clients to the
server. Experimental results on various datasets demonstrate the effectiveness
of FedDCL, showcasing its potential to enhance the generalizability and
practical applicability of federated learning in dynamic settings.

TL;DR: 本文在PAC-Bayesian框架下，为平滑多数投票分类器开发了具有认证鲁棒半径的泛化误差界，并提出了一种新颖且廉价的光谱正则化方法来增强认证鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在PAC-Bayesian框架中，虽然Gibbs分类器和Q加权多数投票分类器常用于分析泛化性能，但缺乏对多数投票分类器认证鲁棒性及其与泛化关系的研究。

Method: 开发了平滑多数投票分类器的泛化误差界，发现泛化界和认证鲁棒半径都依赖于权重谱范数，从而提出在平滑训练中使用光谱正则化来提升认证鲁棒性。利用球面高斯输入的维度无关特性，提出了一种新颖廉价的光谱正则化器。

Result: 理论分析表明泛化界和认证鲁棒半径都依赖于权重谱范数，提出的光谱正则化方法在实验中显示出有效性。

Conclusion: 本文不仅提供了平滑多数投票分类器的理论泛化误差界和认证鲁棒半径，还提出了一种实用的光谱正则化方法来增强认证鲁棒性，并通过实证结果验证了方法的有效性。

Abstract: Within the PAC-Bayesian framework, the Gibbs classifier (defined on a
posterior $Q$) and the corresponding $Q$-weighted majority vote classifier are
commonly used to analyze the generalization performance. However, there exists
a notable lack in theoretical research exploring the certified robustness of
majority vote classifier and its interplay with generalization. In this study,
we develop a generalization error bound that possesses a certified robust
radius for the smoothed majority vote classifier (i.e., the $Q$-weighted
majority vote classifier with smoothed inputs); In other words, the
generalization bound holds under any data perturbation within the certified
robust radius. As a byproduct, we find that the underpinnings of both the
generalization bound and the certified robust radius draw, in part, upon weight
spectral norm, which thereby inspires the adoption of spectral regularization
in smooth training to boost certified robustness. Utilizing the
dimension-independent property of spherical Gaussian inputs in smooth training,
we propose a novel and inexpensive spectral regularizer to enhance the smoothed
majority vote classifier. In addition to the theoretical contribution, a set of
empirical results is provided to substantiate the effectiveness of our proposed
method.

TL;DR: 本文提出间接注意力机制，用于处理键和值来自不同序列或模态时的不对齐问题，在噪声值特征和上下文不对齐情况下优于标准注意力机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准注意力机制假设键和值来自相同序列，但在实际应用中键和值可能来自不同序列或模态，这种不对齐会导致显著的性能下降。

Method: 首先分析注意力机制在噪声值特征下的行为，确定临界噪声阈值；然后将上下文不对齐建模为结构化噪声；最后提出间接注意力机制，通过间接推断相关性来处理不对齐场景。

Result: 在合成任务和实际应用中，间接注意力机制在处理不对齐问题时表现出色，能够有效克服标准注意力机制在上下文不对齐情况下的局限性。

Conclusion: 间接注意力机制为处理键值不对齐问题提供了有效解决方案，在跨模态和跨序列应用中具有重要价值。

Abstract: The attention mechanism has become a cornerstone of modern deep learning
architectures, where keys and values are typically derived from the same
underlying sequence or representation. This work explores a less conventional
scenario, when keys and values originate from different sequences or
modalities. Specifically, we first analyze the attention mechanism's behavior
under noisy value features, establishing a critical noise threshold beyond
which signal degradation becomes significant. Furthermore, we model context
(key, value) misalignment as an effective form of structured noise within the
value features, demonstrating that the noise induced by such misalignment can
substantially exceed this critical threshold, thereby compromising standard
attention's efficacy. Motivated by this, we introduce Indirect Attention, a
modified attention mechanism that infers relevance indirectly in scenarios with
misaligned context. We evaluate the performance of Indirect Attention across a
range of synthetic tasks and real world applications, showcasing its superior
ability to handle misalignment.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Muon优化器在训练大语言模型时比Adam更快，其成功机制源于对关联记忆参数（VO注意力权重和FFN）的优化，以及在处理重尾数据时能更有效地学习尾部类别。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Muon优化器在LLM训练中表现优于Adam，但其成功机制尚不明确。本文旨在通过关联记忆的视角揭示Muon的优势机制。

Method: 通过消融Transformer组件，识别Muon优化的关键参数；分析Muon在重尾数据上的优化特性；构建单层关联记忆模型进行理论分析。

Result: 发现Muon的更新规则产生更各向同性的奇异谱，在重尾数据上能更有效地优化尾部类别；理论证明Muon能实现跨类别的平衡学习，而Adam可能产生较大学习误差差异。

Conclusion: Muon的核心优势在于其更新规则与线性关联记忆的外积结构对齐，使其在重尾分布中比Adam能更平衡有效地学习尾部类别。

Abstract: The Muon optimizer is consistently faster than Adam in training Large
Language Models (LLMs), yet the mechanism underlying its success remains
unclear. This paper demystifies this mechanism through the lens of associative
memory. By ablating the transformer components optimized by Muon, we reveal
that the associative memory parameters of LLMs, namely the Value and Output
(VO) attention weights and Feed-Forward Networks (FFNs), are the primary
contributors to Muon's superiority. Motivated by this associative memory view,
we then explain Muon's superiority on real-world corpora, which are
intrinsically heavy-tailed: a few classes (tail classes) appear far less
frequently than others. The superiority is explained through two key
properties: (i) its update rule consistently yields a more isotropic singular
spectrum than Adam; and as a result, (ii) on heavy-tailed data, it optimizes
tail classes more effectively than Adam. Beyond empirical evidence, we
theoretically confirm these findings by analyzing a one-layer associative
memory model under class-imbalanced data. We prove that Muon consistently
achieves balanced learning across classes regardless of feature embeddings,
whereas Adam can induce large disparities in learning errors depending on
embedding properties. In summary, our empirical observations and theoretical
analyses reveal Muon's core advantage: its update rule aligns with the
outer-product structure of linear associative memories, enabling more balanced
and effective learning of tail classes in heavy-tailed distributions than Adam.

Abstract: There is high demand on fire simulations, in both scale and quantity. We
present a multi-pronged approach to improving the time and energy required to
meet these demands. We show the ability of a custom machine learning surrogate
model to predict the dynamics of heat propagation orders of magnitude faster
than state-of-the-art CFD software for this application. We also demonstrate
how a guided optimisation procedure can decrease the number of simulations
required to meet an objective; using lightweight models to decide which
simulations to run, we see a tenfold reduction when locating the most dangerous
location for a fire to occur within a building based on the impact of smoke on
visibility. Finally we present a framework and product, Simvue, through which
we access these tools along with a host of automatic organisational and
tracking features which enables future reuse of data and more savings through
better management of simulations and combating redundancy.

Motivation: 前沿AI系统在安全评估中可能故意隐藏危险能力或表现不佳以避免被停用或重新训练，这种战略欺骗行为会破坏安全评估的完整性，需要方法区分真实能力不足和故意欺骗。

Conclusion: 这项工作为前沿模型评估科学中开发稳健的统计程序建立了一个潜在途径。

Abstract: Evaluating the safety of frontier AI systems is an increasingly important
concern, helping to measure the capabilities of such models and identify risks
before deployment. However, it has been recognised that if AI agents are aware
that they are being evaluated, such agents may deliberately hide dangerous
capabilities or intentionally demonstrate suboptimal performance in
safety-related tasks in order to be released and to avoid being deactivated or
retrained. Such strategic deception - often known as "sandbagging" - threatens
to undermine the integrity of safety evaluations. For this reason, it is of
value to identify methods that enable us to distinguish behavioural patterns
that demonstrate a true lack of capability from behavioural patterns that are
consistent with sandbagging. In this paper, we develop a simple model of
strategic deception in sequential decision-making tasks, inspired by the
recently developed survival bandit framework. We demonstrate theoretically that
this problem induces sandbagging behaviour in optimal rational agents, and
construct a statistical test to distinguish between sandbagging and
incompetence from sequences of test scores. In simulation experiments, we
investigate the reliability of this test in allowing us to distinguish between
such behaviours in bandit models. This work aims to establish a potential
avenue for developing robust statistical procedures for use in the science of
frontier model evaluations.

Motivation: 解决模仿学习在低数据环境下的挑战，传统方法依赖大规模预训练或高容量架构难以应用，需要提高演示数据的利用效率。

Method: 将模仿学习建模为最优传输问题，通过对抗训练求解，无需预训练或专用架构，内置不确定性估计，实现简单易调。

Result: 在具有挑战性的连续控制任务（包括高维Humanoid任务）上表现强劲，在极低数据环境下仅需20个转换即可有效学习。

Conclusion: NGT作为一种简单高效的模仿学习方法，在低数据环境下具有显著优势，为实际应用提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: We consider imitation learning in the low-data regime, where only a limited
number of expert demonstrations are available. In this setting, methods that
rely on large-scale pretraining or high-capacity architectures can be difficult
to apply, and efficiency with respect to demonstration data becomes critical.
We introduce Noise-Guided Transport (NGT), a lightweight off-policy method that
casts imitation as an optimal transport problem solved via adversarial
training. NGT requires no pretraining or specialized architectures,
incorporates uncertainty estimation by design, and is easy to implement and
tune. Despite its simplicity, NGT achieves strong performance on challenging
continuous control tasks, including high-dimensional Humanoid tasks, under
ultra-low data regimes with as few as 20 transitions. Code is publicly

Motivation: 挑战普遍认为梯度上升方法能有效实现机器遗忘的观点，揭示遗忘集和保留集之间的统计依赖性被忽视的问题。

Method: 通过理论和实证分析，研究梯度上升方法在机器遗忘中的表现，特别关注遗忘集和保留集之间的统计依赖性如何影响遗忘效果。

Result: 发现梯度上升方法经常失败，甚至可能使模型比原始模型更差，特别是在存在统计依赖性的情况下，模型会被困在劣质局部最小值中。

Conclusion: 遗忘集和保留集之间的统计依赖性（即使只是相关性）足以导致基于梯度上升的遗忘方法失败，这一发现在复杂神经网络实验中得到验证。

Abstract: Contrary to common belief, we show that gradient ascent-based unconstrained
optimization methods frequently fail to perform machine unlearning, a
phenomenon we attribute to the inherent statistical dependence between the
forget and retain data sets. This dependence, which can manifest itself even as
simple correlations, undermines the misconception that these sets can be
independently manipulated during unlearning. We provide empirical and
theoretical evidence showing these methods often fail precisely due to this
overlooked relationship. For random forget sets, this dependence means that
degrading forget set metrics (which, for a retrained model, should mirror test
set metrics) inevitably harms overall test performance. Going beyond random
sets, we consider logistic regression as an instructive example where a
critical failure mode emerges: inter-set dependence causes gradient
descent-ascent iterations to progressively diverge from the ideal retrained
model. Strikingly, these methods can converge to solutions that are not only
far from the retrained ideal but are potentially even further from it than the
original model itself, rendering the unlearning process actively detrimental. A
toy example further illustrates how this dependence can trap models in inferior
local minima, inescapable via finetuning. Our findings highlight that the
presence of such statistical dependencies, even when manifest only as
correlations, can be sufficient for ascent-based unlearning to fail. Our
theoretical insights are corroborated by experiments on complex neural
networks, demonstrating that these methods do not perform as expected in
practice due to this unaddressed statistical interplay.

TL;DR: 本文提出了AdaBlock-dLLM，一种训练即插即用的调度器，通过自适应调整块大小来优化扩散式大语言模型的半自回归解码，解决了固定块大小方法的延迟解码开销和过早解码错误问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统半自回归解码采用固定块大小存在两个根本限制：延迟解码开销（高置信度令牌被不必要延迟）和过早解码错误（低置信度令牌过早提交导致错误）。本文旨在挑战固定块大小假设，提升解码效率。

Method: 通过分析去噪过程中的置信度动态，识别出波动带区域，该区域编码局部语义结构。基于此开发AdaBlock-dLLM调度器，在运行时自适应调整块大小，使块边界与语义步骤对齐。

Result: 在多样化基准测试中，AdaBlock-dLLM在相同吞吐量预算下实现了高达5.3%的准确率提升。

Conclusion: 除了推理时优化，本文希望语义感知的自适应调度方法和基于置信度的分析能够启发未来dLLMs的训练策略。

Abstract: Diffusion-based large language models (dLLMs) are gaining attention for their
inherent capacity for parallel decoding, offering a compelling alternative to
autoregressive LLMs. Among various decoding strategies, blockwise
semi-autoregressive (semi-AR) approaches are widely adopted due to their
natural support for KV caching and their favorable accuracy-speed trade-off.
However, this paper identifies two fundamental limitations in the conventional
semi-AR decoding approach that applies a fixed block size: i) late decoding
overhead, where the unmasking of high-confidence tokens outside the current
block is unnecessarily delayed, and ii) premature decoding error, where
low-confidence tokens inside the current block are committed too early, leading
to incorrect tokens. This paper presents the first systematic investigation
challenging the fixed block size assumption in semi-AR decoding. Through a
statistical analysis of confidence dynamics during the denoising process, we
identify a volatility band (VB) region during dLLM decoding, which encodes
local semantic structure and can be used to guide adaptive block sizing.
Leveraging these insights, we introduce AdaBlock-dLLM, a training-free,
plug-and-play scheduler that adaptively aligns block boundaries with semantic
steps by adjusting block size during runtime. Extensive experiments across
diverse benchmarks show that AdaBlock-dLLM achieves up to 5.3% accuracy
improvement under the same throughput budget. Beyond inference-time
optimization, we hope our semantics-aware adaptive scheduling approach and
confidence-based analysis will inspire future training strategies for dLLMs.

Motivation: 在高风险AI应用中，需要透明、可解释和可审计的决策系统。传统决策树（如CART）只能处理结构化数据，而LLM虽然能处理非结构化文本，但其提示策略依赖自由形式推理，难以确保可信行为。

Method: 提出Agentic分类树（ACT），将每个分裂点表示为自然语言问题，通过基于不纯度的评估和TextGrad的LLM反馈来优化问题表述。

Result: 在文本基准测试中，ACT的性能达到或超过基于提示的基线方法，同时生成透明可解释的决策路径。

Conclusion: ACT成功将决策树的可解释性优势扩展到非结构化文本数据，为高风险AI应用提供了既透明又高性能的解决方案。

Abstract: When used in high-stakes settings, AI systems are expected to produce
decisions that are transparent, interpretable, and auditable, a requirement
increasingly expected by regulations. Decision trees such as CART provide clear
and verifiable rules, but they are restricted to structured tabular data and
cannot operate directly on unstructured inputs such as text. In practice, large
language models (LLMs) are widely used for such data, yet prompting strategies
such as chain-of-thought or prompt optimization still rely on free-form
reasoning, limiting their ability to ensure trustworthy behaviors. We present
the Agentic Classification Tree (ACT), which extends decision-tree methodology
to unstructured inputs by formulating each split as a natural-language
question, refined through impurity-based evaluation and LLM feedback via
TextGrad. Experiments on text benchmarks show that ACT matches or surpasses
prompting-based baselines while producing transparent and interpretable
decision paths.

TL;DR: 提出了TAP（两阶段自适应个性化）方法，通过客户端与服务器间不匹配的模型架构和知识蒸馏来解决多任务多模态联邦学习中的个性化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习虽然能在去中心化环境中训练多个模型，但最终模型不一定适合每个客户端的需求。现有研究较少关注如何通过微调具有多任务多模态特性的基础模型来实现个性化。

Method: TAP方法：(i)利用客户端与服务器间不匹配的模型架构，在有利于客户端本地任务时选择性进行替换操作；(ii)在联邦学习后进行知识蒸馏，在不损害个性化的情况下捕获有益的一般知识。

Result: 通过大量实验证明，该方法在多种数据集和任务上相比多个基线方法都表现出有效性。

Conclusion: TAP方法能有效解决多任务多模态联邦学习中的个性化问题，特别是在客户端在数据、任务和模态上存在异质性的场景中。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL), despite demonstrating impressive capabilities in the
training of multiple models in a decentralized manner, has been shown to
produce a final model not necessarily well-suited to the needs of each client.
While extensive work has been conducted on how to create tailored personalized
models, called Personalized Federated Learning (PFL), less attention has been
given to personalization via fine-tuning of foundation models with multi-task
and multi-modal properties. Moreover, there exists a lack of understanding in
the literature on how to fine-tune and personalize such models in a setting
that is heterogeneous across clients not only in data, but also in tasks and
modalities. To address this gap in the literature, we propose TAP (Two-Stage
Adaptive Personalization), which (i) leverages mismatched model architectures
between the clients and server to selectively conduct replacement operations
when it benefits a client's local tasks and (ii) engages in post-FL knowledge
distillation for capturing beneficial general knowledge without compromising
personalization. We also introduce the first convergence analysis of the server
model under its modality-task pair architecture, and demonstrate that as the
number of modality-task pairs increases, its ability to cater to all tasks
suffers. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our
proposed algorithm across a variety of datasets and tasks in comparison to a
multitude of baselines. Implementation code is publicly available at
https://github.com/lee3296/TAP.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一个能够通过最少数据点创建虚拟吉他放大器的系统，减少传统建模方法所需的大量数据采集工作。

Method: 使用LSTM和WaveNet-like架构构建参数化放大器模型，采用基于集成的主动学习策略，通过梯度优化最大化模型间分歧来识别最有信息量的数据点。

Result: 通过75个数据点训练的模型在MUSHRA听力测试中达到了领先开源非参数化放大器建模器NAM的感知质量水平。

Conclusion: Panama框架能够以极少的数据点实现高质量的吉他放大器建模，证明了主动学习策略在音频建模中的有效性。

Abstract: We introduce Panama, an active learning framework to train parametric guitar
amp models end-to-end using a combination of an LSTM model and a WaveNet-like
architecture. With \model, one can create a virtual amp by recording samples
that are determined through an ensemble-based active learning strategy to
minimize the amount of datapoints needed (i.e., amp knob settings). Our
strategy uses gradient-based optimization to maximize the disagreement among
ensemble models, in order to identify the most informative datapoints. MUSHRA
listening tests reveal that, with 75 datapoints, our models are able to match
the perceptual quality of NAM, the leading open-source non-parametric amp
modeler.
