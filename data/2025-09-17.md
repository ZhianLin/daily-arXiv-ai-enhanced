*Mustafa Khanbhai,Giulia Di Nardo,Jun Ma,Vivienne Freitas,Caterina Masino,Ali Dolatabadi,Zhaoxun "Lorenz" Liu,Wey Leong,Wagner H. Souza,Amin Madani*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于U-Mamba架构的人类参与循环机器学习方法，用于改进3D解剖结构分割和重建的算法泛化能力，在乳腺癌MRI数据上取得了优异的分割性能，并提升了临床规划和患者教育效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统模型在处理多样化数据集时泛化能力不足，需要开发能够准确分割解剖结构并适用于不同成像场景的算法，以支持有效的术前规划。

Method: 使用120例回顾性乳腺MRI数据，经过匿名化、手动分割、配准等处理，采用人类参与循环的U-Mamba架构进行分割精炼，使用ITK-SNAP进行3D可视化，并通过Dice相似系数评估分割效果。

Result: U-Mamba在T1加权图像上表现出色：整体器官DSC为0.97±0.013，纤维腺体组织为0.96±0.024，肿瘤为0.82±0.12。生成了准确的3D重建，临床访谈显示改善了术前规划、术中导航和决策支持，患者教育效果提升。

Conclusion: 这种人类参与循环的机器学习方法成功实现了跨患者数据集的算法泛化，为临床医生提供了增强的可视化工具，改善了术前规划，并通过3D可视化促进了患者教育和共享决策。

Abstract: Effective preoperative planning requires accurate algorithms for segmenting
anatomical structures across diverse datasets, but traditional models struggle
with generalization. This study presents a novel machine learning methodology
to improve algorithm generalization for 3D anatomical reconstruction beyond
breast cancer applications. We processed 120 retrospective breast MRIs (January
2018-June 2023) through three phases: anonymization and manual segmentation of
T1-weighted and dynamic contrast-enhanced sequences; co-registration and
segmentation of whole breast, fibroglandular tissue, and tumors; and 3D
visualization using ITK-SNAP. A human-in-the-loop approach refined
segmentations using U-Mamba, designed to generalize across imaging scenarios.
Dice similarity coefficient assessed overlap between automated segmentation and
ground truth. Clinical relevance was evaluated through clinician and patient
interviews. U-Mamba showed strong performance with DSC values of 0.97
($\pm$0.013) for whole organs, 0.96 ($\pm$0.024) for fibroglandular tissue, and
0.82 ($\pm$0.12) for tumors on T1-weighted images. The model generated accurate
3D reconstructions enabling visualization of complex anatomical features.
Clinician interviews indicated improved planning, intraoperative navigation,
and decision support. Integration of 3D visualization enhanced patient
education, communication, and understanding. This human-in-the-loop machine
learning approach successfully generalizes algorithms for 3D reconstruction and
anatomical segmentation across patient datasets, offering enhanced
visualization for clinicians, improved preoperative planning, and more
effective patient education, facilitating shared decision-making and empowering
informed patient choices across medical applications.

### [2] [RU-Net for Automatic Characterization of TRISO Fuel Cross Sections](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12244)
*Lu Cai,Fei Xu,Min Xian,Yalei Tang,Shoukun Sun,John Stempien*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 使用卷积神经网络（CNN）自动分割辐照后TRISO燃料颗粒的微观截面图像，以替代传统人工分析方法，提高效率和客观性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 辐照过程中TRISO燃料颗粒会出现内核膨胀和缓冲层致密化等现象，传统人工显微镜分析数千个颗粒耗时且主观性强，需要自动化解决方案

Method: 构建包含2000多张辐照TRISO颗粒微观图像的数据集，使用多种CNN架构（包括新开发的RU-Net以及U-Net、ResNet、Attention U-Net）进行图像分割

Result: 基于RU-Net的模型在交并比（IoU）指标上表现最佳，能够有效加速TRISO颗粒截面分析

Conclusion: CNN方法可以显著减少人工劳动量，提高分割结果的客观性，为TRISO燃料颗粒的辐照后分析提供高效的自动化工具

Abstract: During irradiation, phenomena such as kernel swelling and buffer
densification may impact the performance of tristructural isotropic (TRISO)
particle fuel. Post-irradiation microscopy is often used to identify these
irradiation-induced morphologic changes. However, each fuel compact generally
contains thousands of TRISO particles. Manually performing the work to get
statistical information on these phenomena is cumbersome and subjective. To
reduce the subjectivity inherent in that process and to accelerate data
analysis, we used convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to automatically segment
cross-sectional images of microscopic TRISO layers. CNNs are a class of
machine-learning algorithms specifically designed for processing structured
grid data. They have gained popularity in recent years due to their remarkable
performance in various computer vision tasks, including image classification,
object detection, and image segmentation. In this research, we generated a
large irradiated TRISO layer dataset with more than 2,000 microscopic images of
cross-sectional TRISO particles and the corresponding annotated images. Based
on these annotated images, we used different CNNs to automatically segment
different TRISO layers. These CNNs include RU-Net (developed in this study), as
well as three existing architectures: U-Net, Residual Network (ResNet), and
Attention U-Net. The preliminary results show that the model based on RU-Net
performs best in terms of Intersection over Union (IoU). Using CNN models, we
can expedite the analysis of TRISO particle cross sections, significantly
reducing the manual labor involved and improving the objectivity of the
segmentation results.

### [3] [Modular, On-Site Solutions with Lightweight Anomaly Detection for Sustainable Nutrient Management in Agriculture](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12247)
*Abigail R. Cohen,Yuming Sun,Zhihao Qin,Harsh S. Muriki,Zihao Xiao,Yeonju Lee,Matthew Housley,Andrew F. Sharkey,Rhuanito S. Ferrarezi,Jing Li,Lu Gan,Yongsheng Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一个分层管道用于作物异常检测和状态估计，包括高效的自动编码器异常检测和两种复杂度不同的状态估计方法（随机森林和视觉变换器），在资源受限环境下实现实时农业优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前养分管理方法需要冗长分析，无法实时优化；成像技术虽然快速但计算密集，难以在资源受限条件下部署。需要开发灵活高效的方法来实现实时作物监测和养分管理。

Method: 使用养分耗竭实验（三种施肥处理）和多光谱成像，构建分层管道：1）自动编码器用于早期异常检测；2）比较两种状态估计模块：基于植被指数的随机森林和基于原始图像的视觉变换器深度学习。

Result: 高效异常检测（移植后9天检测73%的T3样本），能耗远低于浪费氮素的隐含能量。状态估计模块存在权衡，ViT在磷和钙估计上表现更好（R2 0.61 vs 0.58, 0.48 vs 0.35）但能耗更高。

Conclusion: 该模块化管道为边缘诊断和农业可持续发展提供了实用机会，能够在资源受限环境下实现高效的作物监测和养分管理优化。

Abstract: Efficient nutrient management is critical for crop growth and sustainable
resource consumption (e.g., nitrogen, energy). Current approaches require
lengthy analyses, preventing real-time optimization; similarly, imaging
facilitates rapid phenotyping but can be computationally intensive, preventing
deployment under resource constraints. This study proposes a flexible, tiered
pipeline for anomaly detection and status estimation (fresh weight, dry mass,
and tissue nutrients), including a comprehensive energy analysis of approaches
that span the efficiency-accuracy spectrum. Using a nutrient depletion
experiment with three treatments (T1-100%, T2-50%, and T3-25% fertilizer
strength) and multispectral imaging (MSI), we developed a hierarchical pipeline
using an autoencoder (AE) for early warning. Further, we compared two status
estimation modules of different complexity for more detailed analysis:
vegetation index (VI) features with machine learning (Random Forest, RF) and
raw whole-image deep learning (Vision Transformer, ViT). Results demonstrated
high-efficiency anomaly detection (73% net detection of T3 samples 9 days after
transplanting) at substantially lower energy than embodied energy in wasted
nitrogen. The state estimation modules show trade-offs, with ViT outperforming
RF on phosphorus and calcium estimation (R2 0.61 vs. 0.58, 0.48 vs. 0.35) at
higher energy cost. With our modular pipeline, this work opens opportunities
for edge diagnostics and practical opportunities for agricultural
sustainability.

### [4] [Humor in Pixels: Benchmarking Large Multimodal Models Understanding of Online Comics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12248)
*Yuriel Ryan,Rui Yang Tan,Kenny Tsu Wei Choo,Roy Ka-Wei Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PixelHumor是一个包含2800个标注多格漫画的基准数据集，用于评估大型多模态模型的幽默理解和叙事序列识别能力。实验显示当前最先进模型在面板排序任务上仅达到61%准确率，远低于人类水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 幽默理解是社会智能的核心方面，但对大型多模态模型(LMMs)仍是一个重大挑战。需要开发专门的基准来评估模型在多模态幽默解释和叙事序列识别方面的能力。

Method: 引入PixelHumor基准数据集，包含2800个标注的多格漫画，用于评估LMMs在多模态幽默理解和叙事序列识别方面的表现。通过实验测试了最先进的LMMs模型。

Result: 实验结果显示当前顶级模型在面板排序任务上仅达到61%的准确率，远低于人类表现水平。这表明当前模型在整合视觉和文本线索以进行连贯叙事和幽默理解方面存在严重局限性。

Conclusion: PixelHumor为评估多模态上下文和叙事推理提供了一个严谨的框架，旨在推动开发能够更好地参与自然、具有社会意识交互的LMMs模型。

Abstract: Understanding humor is a core aspect of social intelligence, yet it remains a
significant challenge for Large Multimodal Models (LMMs). We introduce
PixelHumor, a benchmark dataset of 2,800 annotated multi-panel comics designed
to evaluate LMMs' ability to interpret multimodal humor and recognize narrative
sequences. Experiments with state-of-the-art LMMs reveal substantial gaps: for
instance, top models achieve only 61% accuracy in panel sequencing, far below
human performance. This underscores critical limitations in current models'
integration of visual and textual cues for coherent narrative and humor
understanding. By providing a rigorous framework for evaluating multimodal
contextual and narrative reasoning, PixelHumor aims to drive the development of
LMMs that better engage in natural, socially aware interactions.

### [5] [OnlineHOI: Towards Online Human-Object Interaction Generation and Perception](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12250)
*Yihong Ji,Yunze Liu,Yiyao Zhuo,Weijiang Yu,Fei Ma,Joshua Huang,Fei Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了在线人-物交互(HOI)生成与感知任务，并基于Mamba框架开发了OnlineHOI网络架构，通过内存机制整合历史信息，在多个在线任务上取得了最先进的结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前HOI方法都是离线设置，可以从整个交互序列获取信息，但现实场景中只能获取当前时刻和历史数据。研究发现离线方法在在线环境下表现不佳，因此需要专门针对在线设置的新方法。

Method: 提出了OnlineHOI框架，基于Mamba框架构建网络架构，采用内存机制来有效整合历史信息，利用Mamba对流数据的强大建模能力。

Result: 在Core4D和OAKINK2在线生成任务以及HOI4D在线感知任务上取得了state-of-the-art的结果。

Conclusion: 在线HOI任务具有重要实际意义，提出的OnlineHOI框架通过结合Mamba和内存机制，成功解决了离线方法在在线环境下的性能问题，为实时人-物交互应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The perception and generation of Human-Object Interaction (HOI) are crucial
for fields such as robotics, AR/VR, and human behavior understanding. However,
current approaches model this task in an offline setting, where information at
each time step can be drawn from the entire interaction sequence. In contrast,
in real-world scenarios, the information available at each time step comes only
from the current moment and historical data, i.e., an online setting. We find
that offline methods perform poorly in an online context. Based on this
observation, we propose two new tasks: Online HOI Generation and Perception. To
address this task, we introduce the OnlineHOI framework, a network architecture
based on the Mamba framework that employs a memory mechanism. By leveraging
Mamba's powerful modeling capabilities for streaming data and the Memory
mechanism's efficient integration of historical information, we achieve
state-of-the-art results on the Core4D and OAKINK2 online generation tasks, as
well as the online HOI4D perception task.

### [6] [EfficientNet-Based Multi-Class Detection of Real, Deepfake, and Plastic Surgery Faces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12258)
*Li Kun,Milena Radenkovic*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文分析了深度学习在Deepfake技术中的应用及其对社会产生的负面影响，包括隐私侵犯、名誉损害和国家安全威胁。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨深度学习技术特别是Deepfake的双面性，揭示其在带来技术进步的同时对社会造成的严重危害，包括隐私泄露、政治操纵和身份盗用等问题。

Method: 通过分析Deepfake技术的原理和应用案例，研究其对社会各个层面的影响，包括技术层面的人脸替换、表情篡改等技术手段。

Result: 研究发现Deepfake技术能够产生难以辨别的伪造图像和视频，严重影响面部识别系统的功能，对个人隐私、名人声誉和国家安全构成重大风险。

Conclusion: Deepfake技术的滥用对社会造成了多方面的负面影响，需要加强技术监管和伦理规范，以平衡技术创新与社会安全的关系。

Abstract: Currently, deep learning has been utilised to tackle several difficulties in
our everyday lives. It not only exhibits progress in computer vision but also
constitutes the foundation for several revolutionary technologies. Nonetheless,
similar to all phenomena, the use of deep learning in diverse domains has
produced a multifaceted interaction of advantages and disadvantages for human
society. Deepfake technology has advanced, significantly impacting social life.
However, developments in this technology can affect privacy, the reputations of
prominent personalities, and national security via software development. It can
produce indistinguishable counterfeit photographs and films, potentially
impairing the functionality of facial recognition systems, so presenting a
significant risk.
  The improper application of deepfake technology produces several detrimental
effects on society. Face-swapping programs mislead users by altering persons'
appearances or expressions to fulfil particular aims or to appropriate personal
information. Deepfake technology permeates daily life through such techniques.
Certain individuals endeavour to sabotage election campaigns or subvert
prominent political figures by creating deceptive pictures to influence public
perception, causing significant harm to a nation's political and economic
structure.

### [7] [A Modern Look at Simplicity Bias in Image Classification Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12265)
*Xiaoguang Chang,Teng Wang,Changyin Sun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文研究了CLIP模型中的简单性偏置（SB）与图像分类任务性能的关系，提出了频率感知的SB测量方法，并发现SB强度与不同任务性能存在相关性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经网络简单性偏置对泛化能力很重要，但现有研究多集中于小模型或合成任务，缺乏对大模型SB的测量方法及其在真实图像分类任务中影响的研究。

Method: 1. 理论分析现有复杂度测量方法的局限性；2. 提出频率感知的SB测量方法；3. 在CLIP模型上验证新方法；4. 研究SB与各种图像分类任务性能的关系，包括零样本和微调设置。

Result: 新提出的频率感知SB测量方法比现有方法更具信息性和一致性；SB强度与性能存在任务相关性：更强的SB与更好的OOD泛化性能相关，但与对抗鲁棒性的关系不同。

Conclusion: 模型归纳偏置与目标任务特性的对齐很重要，SB对性能的影响因任务类型而异，需要根据具体任务调整模型的简单性偏置。

Abstract: The simplicity Bias (SB) of neural networks, i.e.\ their tendency to
represent simple functions, is a key factor in their generalization
capabilities. Recent studies show that an excessive SB may harm performance on
complex tasks, and the need for this bias varies across tasks. Many of these
studies focus on simple models or synthetic tasks. It remains challenging to
measure the SB in large models and little is known about the relevance of the
SB to various image classification tasks.
  In this paper, we investigate the relationship between the SB in CLIP models
and their performance across image classification tasks. First, we
theoretically analyze the potential limitation of existing measures of
complexity that have been used to characterize small models. To address this,
we propose a frequency-aware measure capturing finer-grained SB differences. We
validate this measure on CLIP models subjected to two recent SB-modulation
methods, demonstrating that it is more informative and consistent than previous
measures. Second, we examine the relation between the SB of those models and
their performance across a range of image classification tasks, including
zero-shot and fine-tuning settings. These experiments reveal a range of
behaviors. For example, a stronger SB correlates with a better performance on
OOD generalization than on adversarial robustness. These results highlight the
benefits of aligning a model's inductive biases with the characteristics of the
target task.

### [8] [GraphDerm: Fusing Imaging, Physical Scale, and Metadata in a Population-Graph Classifier for Dermoscopic Lesions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12277)
*Mehdi Yousefzadeh,Parsa Esfahanian,Sara Rashidifar,Hossein Salahshoor Gavalan,Negar Sadat Rafiee Tabatabaee,Saeid Gorgin,Dara Rahmati,Maryam Daneshpazhooh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GraphDerm是一个基于群体图的框架，融合了皮肤镜图像、毫米级校准和患者元数据，用于多类皮肤镜分类，在ISIC数据集上显著优于仅使用图像的基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的皮肤镜AI系统通常只使用图像信息，忽略了患者元数据（年龄、性别、部位）和物理尺度信息，而这些信息对于几何分析和准确分类至关重要。

Method: 使用U-Net进行病变和标尺分割，通过轻量级1D-CNN回归像素-毫米比例，计算真实尺度描述符，构建包含图像特征、元数据和几何相似性的群体图，使用谱GNN进行半监督节点分类。

Result: 标尺和病变分割Dice分数分别为0.904和0.908，尺度回归MAE为1.5像素。图模型达到AUC 0.9812，稀疏版本使用约25%边仍保持AUC 0.9788，显著优于仅图像基线的0.9440。

Conclusion: 将校准尺度、病变几何和元数据统一到群体图中，相比仅使用图像的流程有显著提升。稀疏图能保持接近最优的准确性，表明可高效部署。基于尺度的图AI是皮肤镜决策支持的有前景方向。

Abstract: Introduction. Dermoscopy aids melanoma triage, yet image-only AI often
ignores patient metadata (age, sex, site) and the physical scale needed for
geometric analysis. We present GraphDerm, a population-graph framework that
fuses imaging, millimeter-scale calibration, and metadata for multiclass
dermoscopic classification, to the best of our knowledge the first ISIC-scale
application of GNNs to dermoscopy. Methods. We curate ISIC 2018/2019,
synthesize ruler-embedded images with exact masks, and train U-Nets
(SE-ResNet-18) for lesion and ruler segmentation. Pixels-per-millimeter are
regressed from the ruler-mask two-point correlation via a lightweight 1D-CNN.
From lesion masks we compute real-scale descriptors (area, perimeter, radius of
gyration). Node features use EfficientNet-B3; edges encode metadata/geometry
similarity (fully weighted or thresholded). A spectral GNN performs
semi-supervised node classification; an image-only ANN is the baseline.
Results. Ruler and lesion segmentation reach Dice 0.904 and 0.908; scale
regression attains MAE 1.5 px (RMSE 6.6). The graph attains AUC 0.9812, with a
thresholded variant using about 25% of edges preserving AUC 0.9788 (vs. 0.9440
for the image-only baseline); per-class AUCs typically fall in the 0.97-0.99
range. Conclusion. Unifying calibrated scale, lesion geometry, and metadata in
a population graph yields substantial gains over image-only pipelines on
ISIC-2019. Sparser graphs retain near-optimal accuracy, suggesting efficient
deployment. Scale-aware, graph-based AI is a promising direction for
dermoscopic decision support; future work will refine learned edge semantics
and evaluate on broader curated benchmarks.

### [9] [ResidualViT for Efficient Temporally Dense Video Encoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13255)
*Mattia Soldan,Fabian Caba Heilbron,Bernard Ghanem,Josef Sivic,Bryan Russell*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出ResidualViT架构，通过可学习残差连接和token缩减模块，在保持预训练基础模型精度的同时，显著降低视频时序密集任务的计算成本（减少60%）和提升推理速度（2.5倍）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频理解任务需要高时间分辨率下的时序密集推理，但计算帧级特征的计算成本很高，需要降低计算开销。

Method: 引入ResidualViT架构，包含可学习残差连接确保时序一致性，以及token缩减模块选择性丢弃冗余信息；提出轻量级蒸馏策略近似原始基础模型的帧级特征。

Result: 在4个任务和5个数据集上验证，在零样本和全监督设置下，计算成本降低60%，推理速度提升2.5倍，同时保持与原始基础模型相近的精度。

Conclusion: ResidualViT能有效降低视频时序密集任务的计算成本，在保持性能的同时显著提升效率，适用于多种视频理解任务。

Abstract: Several video understanding tasks, such as natural language temporal video
grounding, temporal activity localization, and audio description generation,
require "temporally dense" reasoning over frames sampled at high temporal
resolution. However, computing frame-level features for these tasks is
computationally expensive given the temporal resolution requirements. In this
paper, we make three contributions to reduce the cost of computing features for
temporally dense tasks. First, we introduce a vision transformer (ViT)
architecture, dubbed ResidualViT, that leverages the large temporal redundancy
in videos to efficiently compute temporally dense frame-level features. Our
architecture incorporates (i) learnable residual connections that ensure
temporal consistency across consecutive frames and (ii) a token reduction
module that enhances processing speed by selectively discarding temporally
redundant information while reusing weights of a pretrained foundation model.
Second, we propose a lightweight distillation strategy to approximate the
frame-level features of the original foundation model. Finally, we evaluate our
approach across four tasks and five datasets, in both zero-shot and fully
supervised settings, demonstrating significant reductions in computational cost
(up to 60%) and improvements in inference speed (up to 2.5x faster), all while
closely approximating the accuracy of the original foundation model.

### [10] [PATIMT-Bench: A Multi-Scenario Benchmark for Position-Aware Text Image Machine Translation in Large Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12278)
*Wanru Zhuang,Wenbo Li,Zhibin Lan,Xu Han,Peng Li,Jinsong Su*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了位置感知文本图像机器翻译(PATIMT)任务，构建了包含10个真实场景的基准数据集PATIMTBench，通过自适应OCR优化流程提升文本识别质量，在紧凑型大视觉语言模型上实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前文本图像机器翻译研究主要关注整图翻译，忽略了位置信息和边界框标注，且覆盖场景有限。需要支持细粒度、保持布局的翻译任务，这在实践中具有重要价值但尚未充分探索。

Method: 提出了位置感知TIMT任务，包含区域特定翻译和带定位的全图翻译两个子任务。构建了PATIMTBench基准数据集，采用自适应图像OCR优化流程，根据场景选择合适OCR工具并优化文本丰富图像的识别结果。

Result: 构建了包含1,200个高质量人工标注实例的测试集。经过数据微调后，紧凑型大视觉语言模型在两个子任务上都达到了最先进的性能。实验结果表明训练数据具有良好的可扩展性和泛化性。

Conclusion: PATIMT任务填补了细粒度布局保持翻译的空白，提出的基准数据集和自适应OCR流程为相关研究提供了可靠评估基础，证明了紧凑模型在该任务上的有效性。

Abstract: Text Image Machine Translation (TIMT) aims to translate texts embedded within
an image into another language. Current TIMT studies primarily focus on
providing translations for all the text within an image, while neglecting to
provide bounding boxes and covering limited scenarios. In this work, we extend
traditional TIMT into position-aware TIMT (PATIMT), aiming to support
fine-grained and layoutpreserving translation, which holds great practical
value but remains largely unexplored. This task comprises two key sub-tasks:
regionspecific translation and full-image translation with grounding. To
support existing models on PATIMT and conduct fair evaluation, we construct the
PATIMT benchmark (PATIMTBench), which consists of 10 diverse real-world
scenarios. Specifically, we introduce an Adaptive Image OCR Refinement
Pipeline, which adaptively selects appropriate OCR tools based on scenario and
refines the results of text-rich images. To ensure evaluation reliability, we
further construct a test set, which contains 1,200 high-quality instances
manually annotated and reviewed by human experts. After fine-tuning on our
data, compact Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) achieve state-of-the-art
performance on both sub-tasks. Experimental results also highlight the
scalability and generalizability of our training data

### [11] [Domain Adaptive SAR Wake Detection: Leveraging Similarity Filtering and Memory Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12279)
*He Gao,Baoxiang Huang,Milena Radenkovic,Borui Li,Ge Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了SimMemDA框架，通过相似性引导和记忆引导的域自适应方法，解决光学图像到SAR图像的跨模态船迹检测问题，提高检测精度和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAR图像具有全天候观测能力但特征抽象噪声大，光学图像视觉特征清晰但存在域偏移问题，需要解决跨模态域自适应挑战。

Method: 使用WakeGAN进行风格迁移生成伪SAR图像，设计实例级特征相似性过滤机制，引入特征-置信度记忆库和K近邻置信度加权融合策略，结合区域混合训练增强泛化能力。

Result: 实验结果表明SimMemDA方法能够提高跨模态船迹检测任务的准确性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效解决了光学到SAR图像的域自适应问题，验证了方法的有效性和可行性。

Abstract: Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), with its all-weather and wide-area
observation capabilities, serves as a crucial tool for wake detection. However,
due to its complex imaging mechanism, wake features in SAR images often appear
abstract and noisy, posing challenges for accurate annotation. In contrast,
optical images provide more distinct visual cues, but models trained on optical
data suffer from performance degradation when applied to SAR images due to
domain shift. To address this cross-modal domain adaptation challenge, we
propose a Similarity-Guided and Memory-Guided Domain Adaptation (termed
SimMemDA) framework for unsupervised domain adaptive ship wake detection via
instance-level feature similarity filtering and feature memory guidance.
Specifically, to alleviate the visual discrepancy between optical and SAR
images, we first utilize WakeGAN to perform style transfer on optical images,
generating pseudo-images close to the SAR style. Then, instance-level feature
similarity filtering mechanism is designed to identify and prioritize source
samples with target-like distributions, minimizing negative transfer.
Meanwhile, a Feature-Confidence Memory Bank combined with a K-nearest neighbor
confidence-weighted fusion strategy is introduced to dynamically calibrate
pseudo-labels in the target domain, improving the reliability and stability of
pseudo-labels. Finally, the framework further enhances generalization through
region-mixed training, strategically combining source annotations with
calibrated target pseudo-labels. Experimental results demonstrate that the
proposed SimMemDA method can improve the accuracy and robustness of cross-modal
ship wake detection tasks, validating the effectiveness and feasibility of the
proposed method.

### [12] [Uncertainty-Aware Hourly Air Temperature Mapping at 2 km Resolution via Physics-Guided Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12329)
*Shengjie Kris Liu,Siqin Wang,Lu Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Amplifier Air-Transformer的数据驱动、物理引导的深度学习方法，用于生成美国本土2公里分辨率的小时级气温数据，通过神经网络重建云层遮挡的地表温度并转换为气温，验证精度达到1.93°C。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然气象站提供连续监测，卫星提供广泛空间覆盖，但没有单一数据源能够提供无缝的时空连续气温数据，需要开发新的方法来填补这一空白。

Method: 使用Amplifier Air-Transformer方法：1）通过编码年温度周期的神经网络重建GOES-16被云遮挡的地表温度；2）利用线性项放大ERA5温度值到更细尺度；3）使用卷积层捕捉时空变化；4）通过另一个神经网络将重建的地表温度转换为气温；5）采用深度集成学习进行预测不确定性估计。

Result: 基于美国本土2018-2024年777亿个地表温度像素和1.55亿个气象站气温记录构建和测试，在站点验证中达到1.93°C的小时气温映射精度。

Conclusion: 该方法简化了地表温度重建和气温预测流程，可扩展到其他卫星数据源，实现高时空分辨率的无缝气温监测。

Abstract: Near-surface air temperature is a key physical property of the Earth's
surface. Although weather stations offer continuous monitoring and satellites
provide broad spatial coverage, no single data source offers seamless data in a
spatiotemporal fashion. Here, we propose a data-driven, physics-guided deep
learning approach to generate hourly air temperature data at 2 km resolution
over the contiguous United States. The approach, called Amplifier
Air-Transformer, first reconstructs GOES-16 surface temperature data obscured
by clouds. It does so through a neural network encoded with the annual
temperature cycle, incorporating a linear term to amplify ERA5 temperature
values at finer scales and convolutional layers to capture spatiotemporal
variations. Then, another neural network transforms the reconstructed surface
temperature into air temperature by leveraging its latent relationship with key
Earth surface properties. The approach is further enhanced with predictive
uncertainty estimation through deep ensemble learning to improve reliability.
The proposed approach is built and tested on 77.7 billion surface temperature
pixels and 155 million air temperature records from weather stations across the
contiguous United States (2018-2024), achieving hourly air temperature mapping

*Anthony Miyaguchi,Chandrasekaran Maruthaiyannan,Charles R. Clark*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DS@GT团队在AnimalCLEF 2025重识别挑战中发现，后处理度量学习的效果高度依赖于骨干嵌入的初始质量和领域特异性。领域特定模型MegaDescriptor比通用模型DINOv2更适合细粒度重识别任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究通用预训练模型与领域特定模型在动物重识别任务中的表现差异，探索后处理度量学习对不同类型骨干网络的有效性。

Method: 使用K近邻分类器配合鲁棒阈值处理，比较DINOv2（通用模型）和MegaDescriptor（领域特定模型）作为骨干网络。采用三元组学习投影头进行性能提升。

Result: 三元组学习对MegaDescriptor提升0.13分，但对DINOv2仅提升0.03分（基于BAKS和BAUS平均）。通用模型的流形更难为细粒度任务重塑，验证损失停滞。

Conclusion: 通用特征在专业化、数据有限的重识别任务中存在关键局限性，领域特异性预训练至关重要。通用流形难以针对细粒度任务进行有效重塑。

Abstract: This paper details the DS@GT team's entry for the AnimalCLEF 2025
re-identification challenge. Our key finding is that the effectiveness of
post-hoc metric learning is highly contingent on the initial quality and
domain-specificity of the backbone embeddings. We compare a general-purpose
model (DINOv2) with a domain-specific model (MegaDescriptor) as a backbone. A
K-Nearest Neighbor classifier with robust thresholding then identifies known
individuals or flags new ones. While a triplet-learning projection head
improved the performance of the specialized MegaDescriptor model by 0.13
points, it yielded minimal gains (0.03) for the general-purpose DINOv2 on
averaged BAKS and BAUS. We demonstrate that the general-purpose manifold is
more difficult to reshape for fine-grained tasks, as evidenced by stagnant
validation loss and qualitative visualizations. This work highlights the
critical limitations of refining general-purpose features for specialized,
limited-data re-ID tasks and underscores the importance of domain-specific
pre-training. The implementation for this work is publicly available at
github.com/dsgt-arc/animalclef-2025.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了GhostNetV3-Small模型，在CIFAR-10上达到93.94%准确率，比原版GhostNetV3表现更好。研究发现架构适配比知识蒸馏更有效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络在资源受限的边缘设备上部署困难，需要压缩和适配模型以实现高效推理。

Method: 开发GhostNetV3-Small变体适配低分辨率输入，并比较了传统知识蒸馏、教师助理和教师集成等蒸馏技术。

Result: GhostNetV3-Small在CIFAR-10上显著优于原版模型，但所有蒸馏策略都导致准确率下降。

Conclusion: 在小规模图像分类任务中，架构适配比蒸馏技术更有效，需要在低分辨率领域进行更多模型设计和高级蒸馏技术研究。

Abstract: Deep neural networks have achieved remarkable success across a range of
tasks, however their computational demands often make them unsuitable for
deployment on resource-constrained edge devices. This paper explores strategies
for compressing and adapting models to enable efficient inference in such
environments. We focus on GhostNetV3, a state-of-the-art architecture for
mobile applications, and propose GhostNetV3-Small, a modified variant designed
to perform better on low-resolution inputs such as those in the CIFAR-10
dataset. In addition to architectural adaptation, we provide a comparative
evaluation of knowledge distillation techniques, including traditional
knowledge distillation, teacher assistants, and teacher ensembles. Experimental
results show that GhostNetV3-Small significantly outperforms the original
GhostNetV3 on CIFAR-10, achieving an accuracy of 93.94%. Contrary to
expectations, all examined distillation strategies led to reduced accuracy
compared to baseline training. These findings indicate that architectural
adaptation can be more impactful than distillation in small-scale image
classification tasks, highlighting the need for further research on effective
model design and advanced distillation techniques for low-resolution domains.

Abstract: Accurate mapping of individual trees is essential for ecological monitoring
and forest management. Orthomosaic imagery from unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)
is widely used, but stitching artifacts and heavy preprocessing limit its
suitability for field deployment. This study explores the use of raw UAV
imagery for palm detection and crown-center localization in tropical forests.
Two research questions are addressed: (1) how detection performance varies
across orthomosaic and raw imagery, including within-domain and cross-domain
transfer, and (2) to what extent crown-center annotations improve localization
accuracy beyond bounding-box centroids. Using state-of-the-art detectors and
keypoint models, we show that raw imagery yields superior performance in
deployment-relevant scenarios, while orthomosaics retain value for robust
cross-domain generalization. Incorporating crown-center annotations in training
further improves localization and provides precise tree positions for
downstream ecological analyses. These findings offer practical guidance for
UAV-based biodiversity and conservation monitoring.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了MechBench数据集和DYNAMO模型，用于从CAD点云预测齿轮组件的耦合运动轨迹，解决了机械装配体中基于几何耦合的运动推理问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要针对简化运动结构或依赖关节标注的日常铰接物体，但机械装配体（如齿轮）的运动源于几何耦合（啮合齿或对齐轴），难以仅从几何形状推理关系运动。

Method: 引入MechBench数据集（693个合成齿轮装配体）和DYNAMO模型——一个依赖感知的神经网络模型，直接从分割的CAD点云预测每个部件的SE(3)运动轨迹。

Result: 实验表明DYNAMO优于强基线方法，在不同齿轮配置下实现了准确且时间一致的运动预测。

Conclusion: MechBench和DYNAMO共同建立了一个新颖的系统框架，用于CAD装配体中耦合机械运动的数据驱动学习。

Abstract: Understanding the motion of articulated mechanical assemblies from static
geometry remains a core challenge in 3D perception and design automation. Prior
work on everyday articulated objects such as doors and laptops typically
assumes simplified kinematic structures or relies on joint annotations.
However, in mechanical assemblies like gears, motion arises from geometric
coupling, through meshing teeth or aligned axes, making it difficult for
existing methods to reason about relational motion from geometry alone. To
address this gap, we introduce MechBench, a benchmark dataset of 693 diverse
synthetic gear assemblies with part-wise ground-truth motion trajectories.
MechBench provides a structured setting to study coupled motion, where part
dynamics are induced by contact and transmission rather than predefined joints.
Building on this, we propose DYNAMO, a dependency-aware neural model that
predicts per-part SE(3) motion trajectories directly from segmented CAD point
clouds. Experiments show that DYNAMO outperforms strong baselines, achieving
accurate and temporally consistent predictions across varied gear
configurations. Together, MechBench and DYNAMO establish a novel systematic
framework for data-driven learning of coupled mechanical motion in CAD
assemblies.

Conclusion: Cott-ADNet是准确高效的田间部署解决方案，为自动化棉花收获和高通量表型分析提供可靠技术支撑。

Abstract: Cotton is one of the most important natural fiber crops worldwide, yet
harvesting remains limited by labor-intensive manual picking, low efficiency,
and yield losses from missing the optimal harvest window. Accurate recognition
of cotton bolls and their maturity is therefore essential for automation, yield
estimation, and breeding research. We propose Cott-ADNet, a lightweight
real-time detector tailored to cotton boll and flower recognition under complex
field conditions. Building on YOLOv11n, Cott-ADNet enhances spatial
representation and robustness through improved convolutional designs, while
introducing two new modules: a NeLU-enhanced Global Attention Mechanism to
better capture weak and low-contrast features, and a Dilated Receptive Field
SPPF to expand receptive fields for more effective multi-scale context modeling
at low computational cost. We curate a labeled dataset of 4,966 images, and
release an external validation set of 1,216 field images to support future
research. Experiments show that Cott-ADNet achieves 91.5% Precision, 89.8%
Recall, 93.3% mAP50, 71.3% mAP, and 90.6% F1-Score with only 7.5 GFLOPs,
maintaining stable performance under multi-scale and rotational variations.
These results demonstrate Cott-ADNet as an accurate and efficient solution for
in-field deployment, and thus provide a reliable basis for automated cotton
harvesting and high-throughput phenotypic analysis. Code and dataset is

Abstract: Point cloud processing as a fundamental task in the field of geomatics and
computer vision, has been supporting tasks and applications at different scales
from air to ground, including mapping, environmental monitoring, urban/tree
structure modeling, automated driving, robotics, disaster responses etc. Due to
the rapid development of deep learning, point cloud processing algorithms have
nowadays been almost explicitly dominated by learning-based approaches, most of
which are yet transitioned into real-world practices. Existing surveys
primarily focus on the ever-updating network architecture to accommodate
unordered point clouds, largely ignoring their practical values in typical
point cloud processing applications, in which extra-large volume of data,
diverse scene contents, varying point density, data modality need to be
considered. In this paper, we provide a meta review on deep learning approaches
and datasets that cover a selection of critical tasks of point cloud processing
in use such as scene completion, registration, semantic segmentation, and
modeling. By reviewing a broad range of urban and environmental applications
these tasks can support, we identify gaps to be closed as these methods
transformed into applications and draw concluding remarks in both the
algorithmic and practical aspects of the surveyed methods.

Motivation: 青光眼是全球不可逆失明的主要原因之一，现有预后方法受限于固定长度输入和有限数据集规模，需要更灵活高效的解决方案。

Result: 在OHTS和GRAPE两个不同规模和临床环境的基准数据集上验证了方法的有效性和鲁棒性，显著提升了模型性能同时保持参数紧凑。

Conclusion: TSDF框架能够有效利用多源青光眼数据，处理可变长度序列，为青光眼预后提供了灵活且高性能的解决方案。

Abstract: Glaucoma is one of the leading causes of irreversible blindness worldwide.
Glaucoma prognosis is essential for identifying at-risk patients and enabling
timely intervention to prevent blindness. Many existing approaches rely on
historical sequential data but are constrained by fixed-length inputs, limiting
their flexibility. Additionally, traditional glaucoma prognosis methods often
employ end-to-end models, which struggle with the limited size of glaucoma
datasets. To address these challenges, we propose a Two-Stage Decoupling
Framework (TSDF) for variable-length glaucoma prognosis. In the first stage, we
employ a feature representation module that leverages self-supervised learning
to aggregate multiple glaucoma datasets for training, disregarding differences
in their supervisory information. This approach enables datasets of varying
sizes to learn better feature representations. In the second stage, we
introduce a temporal aggregation module that incorporates an attention-based
mechanism to process sequential inputs of varying lengths, ensuring flexible
and efficient utilization of all available data. This design significantly
enhances model performance while maintaining a compact parameter size.
Extensive experiments on two benchmark glaucoma datasets:the Ocular
Hypertension Treatment Study (OHTS) and the Glaucoma Real-world Appraisal
Progression Ensemble (GRAPE),which differ significantly in scale and clinical
settings,demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our approach.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的tokenizer训练方案，包括主训练和后训练，通过模拟生成过程中的采样噪声来减少重建与生成分布之间的差异，显著提升了生成质量和收敛速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前图像生成模型在预构建的潜在空间中捕获图像分布，但重建分布与生成分布存在显著差异。现有tokenizer仅关注重建任务，未考虑生成过程中的采样误差。

Method: 提出主训练和后训练两阶段方案：主训练采用潜在扰动策略模拟采样噪声，提升tokenizer鲁棒性；后训练针对训练好的生成模型优化tokenizer解码器，减少生成与重建token的分布差异。

Result: 使用约4亿参数的生成器，经过主训练的离散tokenizer达到1.60 gFID，后训练后进一步提升至1.36 gFID。实验验证了该方法对离散和连续tokenizer以及自回归和扩散生成器的有效性。

Conclusion: 所提出的tokenizer训练方案有效解决了重建与生成分布差异问题，显著提升了生成质量，并提出了新的评估指标pFID来关联tokenizer性能与生成质量。

Abstract: Recent image generative models typically capture the image distribution in a
pre-constructed latent space, relying on a frozen image tokenizer. However,
there exists a significant discrepancy between the reconstruction and
generation distribution, where current tokenizers only prioritize the
reconstruction task that happens before generative training without considering
the generation errors during sampling. In this paper, we comprehensively
analyze the reason for this discrepancy in a discrete latent space, and, from
which, we propose a novel tokenizer training scheme including both
main-training and post-training, focusing on improving latent space
construction and decoding respectively. During the main training, a latent
perturbation strategy is proposed to simulate sampling noises, \ie, the
unexpected tokens generated in generative inference. Specifically, we propose a
plug-and-play tokenizer training scheme, which significantly enhances the
robustness of tokenizer, thus boosting the generation quality and convergence
speed, and a novel tokenizer evaluation metric, \ie, pFID, which successfully
correlates the tokenizer performance to generation quality. During
post-training, we further optimize the tokenizer decoder regarding a
well-trained generative model to mitigate the distribution difference between
generated and reconstructed tokens. With a $\sim$400M generator, a discrete
tokenizer trained with our proposed main training achieves a notable 1.60 gFID
and further obtains 1.36 gFID with the additional post-training. Further
experiments are conducted to broadly validate the effectiveness of our
post-training strategy on off-the-shelf discrete and continuous tokenizers,
coupled with autoregressive and diffusion-based generators.

TL;DR: 提出了GRT（Generalizable Radar Transformer）基础模型，使用100万样本训练，能够从单芯片毫米波雷达数据中预测3D占用和语义分割，性能接近高分辨率传感器，并展示了良好的泛化能力和数据缩放特性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 毫米波雷达虽然成本低、耐用且对遮挡和环境条件鲁棒，但角分辨率较差。现有方法缺乏标准化基础模型和大规模数据集，通常需要从头训练任务特定模型。

Method: 收集了100万样本（29小时）的大规模原始雷达数据集，训练了基于Transformer的GRT基础模型，使用原始雷达数据而非传统的有损表示。

Result: GRT能够预测高质量的3D占用和语义分割，性能接近高分辨率传感器，展示了对不同设置的泛化能力，每10倍数据量提升20%性能，原始数据使用相当于10倍训练数据增益。

Conclusion: GRT是首个大规模毫米波雷达基础模型，证明了使用原始数据和Transformer架构的有效性，估计需要约1亿样本（3000小时）才能充分发挥其潜力。

Abstract: mmWave radars are compact, inexpensive, and durable sensors that are robust
to occlusions and work regardless of environmental conditions, such as weather
and darkness. However, this comes at the cost of poor angular resolution,
especially for inexpensive single-chip radars, which are typically used in
automotive and indoor sensing applications. Although many have proposed
learning-based methods to mitigate this weakness, no standardized foundational
models or large datasets for the mmWave radar have emerged, and practitioners
have largely trained task-specific models from scratch using relatively small
datasets.
  In this paper, we collect (to our knowledge) the largest available raw radar
dataset with 1M samples (29 hours) and train a foundational model for 4D
single-chip radar, which can predict 3D occupancy and semantic segmentation
with quality that is typically only possible with much higher resolution
sensors. We demonstrate that our Generalizable Radar Transformer (GRT)
generalizes across diverse settings, can be fine-tuned for different tasks, and
shows logarithmic data scaling of 20\% per $10\times$ data. We also run
extensive ablations on common design decisions, and find that using raw radar
data significantly outperforms widely-used lossy representations, equivalent to
a $10\times$ increase in training data. Finally, we roughly estimate that
$\approx$100M samples (3000 hours) of data are required to fully exploit the
potential of GRT.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型在多模态任务中表现出色，但其在噪声条件下的鲁棒性尚未得到充分研究。本研究旨在填补这一空白，为未来鲁棒多模态学习提供标准化基准。

Method: 使用包含光照变化、运动模糊和压缩伪影的受控扰动，通过词汇级指标（BLEU、METEOR、ROUGE、CIDEr）和基于神经网络的句子嵌入相似度度量来量化语义对齐，在多个数据集上进行实验。

Result: 研究发现：(1) 真实标注的描述性显著影响模型性能；(2) 大型模型如LLaVA在语义理解方面表现出色，但并非在所有情况下都优于小型模型；(3) JPEG压缩和运动模糊等特定噪声类型会显著降低所有模型的性能。

Conclusion: 研究强调了模型大小、数据集特征和噪声鲁棒性之间的微妙权衡关系，为未来鲁棒多模态学习提供了一个标准化的评估基准，有助于指导更稳健的视觉语言模型开发。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have attained exceptional success across
multimodal tasks such as image captioning and visual question answering.
However, their robustness under noisy conditions remains unfamiliar. In this
study, we present a comprehensive evaluation framework to evaluate the
performance of several state-of-the-art VLMs under controlled perturbations,
including lighting variation, motion blur, and compression artifacts. We used
both lexical-based metrics (BLEU, METEOR, ROUGE, CIDEr) and neural-based
similarity measures using sentence embeddings to quantify semantic alignment.
Our experiments span diverse datasets, revealing key insights: (1)
descriptiveness of ground-truth captions significantly influences model
performance; (2) larger models like LLaVA excel in semantic understanding but
do not universally outperform smaller models; and (3) certain noise types, such
as JPEG compression and motion blur, dramatically degrade performance across
models. Our findings highlight the nuanced trade-offs between model size,
dataset characteristics, and noise resilience, offering a standardized
benchmark for future robust multimodal learning.

Motivation: 解决现有弱监督语义分割方法在对象边界定位不精确和仅关注最具判别性区域的问题，避免昂贵的像素级标注需求。

Method: 提出IG-CAM方法，包含三个关键创新：实例引导细化、影响函数集成和多尺度边界增强，利用实例级线索和影响函数生成高质量、边界感知的定位图。

Result: 在PASCAL VOC 2012数据集上达到82.3%的mIoU（后处理前），经过CRF细化后提升至86.6%，显著超越先前方法，展示了优异的定位精度和完整对象覆盖。

Conclusion: IG-CAM为弱监督语义分割设立了新的基准，为像素级标注不可用或成本过高的场景提供了实用解决方案，具有优异的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation (WSSS) addresses the challenge of
training segmentation models using only image-level annotations, eliminating
the need for expensive pixel-level labeling. While existing methods struggle
with precise object boundary localization and often focus only on the most
discriminative regions, we propose IG-CAM (Instance-Guided Class Activation
Mapping), a novel approach that leverages instance-level cues and influence
functions to generate high-quality, boundary-aware localization maps. Our
method introduces three key innovations: (1) Instance-Guided Refinement that
uses ground truth segmentation masks to guide CAM generation, ensuring complete
object coverage rather than just discriminative parts; (2) Influence Function
Integration that captures the relationship between training samples and model
predictions, leading to more robust feature representations; and (3)
Multi-Scale Boundary Enhancement that employs progressive refinement strategies
to achieve sharp, precise object boundaries. IG-CAM achieves state-of-the-art
performance on the PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset with an mIoU of 82.3% before
post-processing, which further improves to 86.6% after applying Conditional
Random Field (CRF) refinement, significantly outperforming previous WSSS
methods. Our approach demonstrates superior localization accuracy, with
complete object coverage and precise boundary delineation, while maintaining
computational efficiency. Extensive ablation studies validate the contribution
of each component, and qualitative comparisons across 600 diverse images
showcase the method's robustness and generalization capability. The results
establish IG-CAM as a new benchmark for weakly supervised semantic
segmentation, offering a practical solution for scenarios where pixel-level
annotations are unavailable or prohibitively expensive.

Abstract: We present an end-to-end framework for generating artist-style meshes from
noisy or incomplete point clouds, such as those captured by real-world sensors
like LiDAR or mobile RGB-D cameras. Artist-created meshes are crucial for
commercial graphics pipelines due to their compatibility with animation and
texturing tools and their efficiency in rendering. However, existing approaches
often assume clean, complete inputs or rely on complex multi-stage pipelines,
limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios. To address this, we
propose an end-to-end method that refines the input point cloud and directly
produces high-quality, artist-style meshes. At the core of our approach is a
novel reformulation of 3D point cloud refinement as a 2D inpainting task,
enabling the use of powerful generative models. Preliminary results on the
ShapeNet dataset demonstrate the promise of our framework in producing clean,
complete meshes.

Abstract: Accurate, high-throughput phenotyping is a critical component of modern crop
breeding programs, especially for improving traits such as mechanical
stability, biomass production, and disease resistance. Stalk diameter is a key
structural trait, but traditional measurement methods are labor-intensive,
error-prone, and unsuitable for scalable phenotyping. In this paper, we present
a geometry-aware computer vision pipeline for estimating stalk diameter from
RGB-D imagery. Our method integrates deep learning-based instance segmentation,
3D point cloud reconstruction, and axis-aligned slicing via Principal Component
Analysis (PCA) to perform robust diameter estimation. By mitigating the effects
of curvature, occlusion, and image noise, this approach offers a scalable and
reliable solution to support high-throughput phenotyping in breeding and
agronomic research.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across
distributed clients while preserving data privacy. However, the performance of
deep learning often deteriorates in FL due to decentralized and heterogeneous
data. This challenge is further amplified in multi-label scenarios, where data
exhibit complex characteristics such as label co-occurrence, inter-label
dependency, and discrepancies between local and global label relationships.
While most existing FL research primarily focuses on single-label
classification, many real-world applications, particularly in domains such as
medical imaging, often involve multi-label settings. In this paper, we address
this important yet underexplored scenario in FL, where clients hold multi-label
data with skewed label distributions. Neural Collapse (NC) describes a
geometric structure in the latent feature space where features of each class
collapse to their class mean with vanishing intra-class variance, and the class
means form a maximally separated configuration. Motivated by this theory, we
propose a method to align feature distributions across clients and to learn
high-quality, well-clustered representations. To make the NC-structure
applicable to multi-label settings, where image-level features may contain
multiple semantic concepts, we introduce a feature disentanglement module that
extracts semantically specific features. The clustering of these disentangled
class-wise features is guided by a predefined shared NC structure, which
mitigates potential conflicts between client models due to diverse local data
distributions. In addition, we design regularisation losses to encourage
compact clustering in the latent feature space. Experiments conducted on four
benchmark datasets across eight diverse settings demonstrate that our approach
outperforms existing methods, validating its effectiveness in this challenging
FL scenario.

TL;DR: 本文提出Agent4FaceForgery多智能体框架，通过LLM驱动的智能体模拟人类伪造意图和迭代过程，生成具有文本-图像一致性的伪造数据，解决人脸伪造检测中训练数据生态无效性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人脸伪造检测面临离线基准与真实世界效果之间的显著差距，主要原因是训练数据的生态无效性。需要解决两个核心问题：如何捕捉人类伪造的多样化意图和迭代过程，以及如何建模社交媒体中复杂的文本-图像对抗性交互。

Method: 提出多智能体框架，配备配置文件和记忆模块的LLM驱动智能体模拟伪造创建过程。智能体在模拟社交环境中交互生成带有精细文本-图像一致性标签的样本，采用自适应拒绝采样(ARS)机制确保数据质量和多样性。

Conclusion: Agent4FaceForgery框架成功解决了人脸伪造检测中的生态无效性问题，通过模拟真实世界的伪造过程生成高质量训练数据，显著提升了检测器的性能表现。

Abstract: Face forgery detection faces a critical challenge: a persistent gap between
offline benchmarks and real-world efficacy,which we attribute to the ecological
invalidity of training data.This work introduces Agent4FaceForgery to address
two fundamental problems: (1) how to capture the diverse intents and iterative
processes of human forgery creation, and (2) how to model the complex, often
adversarial, text-image interactions that accompany forgeries in social media.
To solve this,we propose a multi-agent framework where LLM-poweredagents,
equipped with profile and memory modules, simulate the forgery creation
process. Crucially, these agents interact in a simulated social environment to
generate samples labeled for nuanced text-image consistency, moving beyond
simple binary classification. An Adaptive Rejection Sampling (ARS) mechanism
ensures data quality and diversity. Extensive experiments validate that the
data generated by our simulationdriven approach brings significant performance
gains to detectors of multiple architectures, fully demonstrating the
effectiveness and value of our framework.

TL;DR: 提出MGNM多模态图网络模型，利用GNN显式建模人-物交互关系，在HOI检测任务上达到SOTA性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer方法在HOI检测中无法显式建模关系结构，而GNN天生更适合建模人-物对之间的关系

Method: 设计四阶段图结构的多模态图网络框架，引入多级特征交互机制，利用多级视觉和语言特征增强人-物对间的信息传播

Result: 在HICO-DET和V-COCO基准测试中达到state-of-the-art性能，与更先进的目标检测器结合时性能显著提升，在稀有和非稀有类别间保持有效平衡

Conclusion: GNN-based的关系结构建模能有效提升HOI检测性能，多模态图网络是解决该任务的有效方法

Abstract: Transformer-based methods have recently become the prevailing approach for
Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection. However, the Transformer architecture
does not explicitly model the relational structures inherent in HOI detection,
which impedes the recognition of interactions. In contrast, Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs) are inherently better suited for this task, as they explicitly
model the relationships between human-object pairs. Therefore, in this paper,
we propose \textbf{M}ultimodal \textbf{G}raph \textbf{N}etwork
\textbf{M}odeling (MGNM) that leverages GNN-based relational structures to
enhance HOI detection. Specifically, we design a multimodal graph network
framework that explicitly models the HOI task in a four-stage graph structure.
Furthermore, we introduce a multi-level feature interaction mechanism within
our graph network. This mechanism leverages multi-level vision and language
features to enhance information propagation across human-object pairs.
Consequently, our proposed MGNM achieves state-of-the-art performance on two
widely used benchmarks: HICO-DET and V-COCO. Moreover, when integrated with a
more advanced object detector, our method demonstrates a significant
performance gain and maintains an effective balance between rare and non-rare
classes.

TL;DR: VQT-Light是一个基于VQVAE和ViT架构的轻量级光照估计框架，通过将光照估计转化为多分类任务，实现了40FPS的推理速度，并在纹理细节和保真度方面优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有光照估计方法要么难以恢复光照图的细节纹理，要么在运行速度和纹理保真度方面面临挑战，需要一种既能保持细节又能快速推理的解决方案。

Method: 提出VQT-Light框架，包含特征提取和光照估计两个模块：1）使用VQVAE提取光照图的离散特征以避免"后验坍塌"；2）使用ViT而非CNN捕获输入图像的全局上下文和依赖关系，以改善视野外光照预测；3）将光照估计公式化为多分类任务。

Result: 模型实现了40FPS的推理速度，在多个评估指标上有所提升，能够预测具有更丰富纹理和更好保真度的光照图，同时保持轻量级和快速。

Conclusion: 定性和定量实验表明，该方法相比现有最先进方法实现了优越的结果，成功解决了光照估计中的纹理细节和速度平衡问题。

Abstract: Accurate lighting estimation is a significant yet challenging task in
computer vision and graphics. However, existing methods either struggle to
restore detailed textures of illumination map, or face challenges in running
speed and texture fidelity. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel
framework (VQT-Light) based on VQVAE and ViT architecture. VQT-Light includes
two modules: feature extraction and lighting estimation. First, we take
advantages of VQVAE to extract discrete features of illumination map rather
than continuous features to avoid "posterior collapse". Second, we capture
global context and dependencies of input image through ViT rather than CNNs to
improve the prediction of illumination outside the field of view. Combining the
above two modules, we formulate the lighting estimation as a multiclass
classification task, which plays a key role in our pipeline. As a result, our
model predicts light map with richer texture and better fidelity while keeping
lightweight and fast. VQT-Light achieves an inference speed of 40FPS and
improves multiple evaluation metrics. Qualitative and quantitative experiments
demonstrate that the proposed method realizes superior results compared to
existing state-of-the-art methods.

Motivation: 现有的一致性蒸馏方法在目标时间步选择上主要依赖确定性或随机策略，需要为不同蒸馏过程专门设计采样调度器，限制了扩散模型在实际应用中的采样灵活性和性能潜力。

Method: 提出自适应采样调度器，包含三个创新策略：(1)基于计算重要性的动态目标时间步选择；(2)基于时间步重要性的优化交替采样；(3)使用平滑裁剪和颜色平衡技术实现稳定高质量生成。

Result: 通过全面实验验证，在各种一致性蒸馏方法上都显示出显著生成性能提升，证明了方法的有效性和灵活性。

Conclusion: 该方法实现了强适应性，扩展了一致性蒸馏模型在复杂生成场景中的适用性，为扩散模型采样提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Consistent distillation methods have evolved into effective techniques that
significantly accelerate the sampling process of diffusion models. Although
existing methods have achieved remarkable results, the selection of target
timesteps during distillation mainly relies on deterministic or stochastic
strategies, which often require sampling schedulers to be designed specifically
for different distillation processes. Moreover, this pattern severely limits
flexibility, thereby restricting the full sampling potential of diffusion
models in practical applications. To overcome these limitations, this paper
proposes an adaptive sampling scheduler that is applicable to various
consistency distillation frameworks. The scheduler introduces three innovative
strategies: (i) dynamic target timestep selection, which adapts to different
consistency distillation frameworks by selecting timesteps based on their
computed importance; (ii) Optimized alternating sampling along the solution
trajectory by guiding forward denoising and backward noise addition based on
the proposed time step importance, enabling more effective exploration of the
solution space to enhance generation performance; and (iii) Utilization of
smoothing clipping and color balancing techniques to achieve stable and
high-quality generation results at high guidance scales, thereby expanding the
applicability of consistency distillation models in complex generation
scenarios. We validated the effectiveness and flexibility of the adaptive
sampling scheduler across various consistency distillation methods through
comprehensive experimental evaluations. Experimental results consistently
demonstrated significant improvements in generative performance, highlighting
the strong adaptability achieved by our method.

TL;DR: 提出针对LiDAR定位的对抗攻击框架DisorientLiDAR，通过逆向工程识别关键点并移除，显著降低点云配准精度，并在物理世界中验证攻击效果


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型易受视觉不可察觉的对抗攻击影响，但针对自动驾驶定位系统的攻击研究较少，大多数对抗攻击集中在3D感知领域

Method: 逆向工程定位模型（如特征提取网络），识别关键关键点并策略性移除，破坏基于LiDAR的定位系统。使用近红外吸收材料在物理世界隐藏关键区域

Result: 在KITTI数据集上测试三种最先进点云配准模型（HRegNet、D3Feat、GeoTransformer），移除包含Top-K关键点的区域显著降低配准精度。在Autoware平台上隐藏少量关键区域即可引起明显定位漂移

Conclusion: 该攻击框架验证了LiDAR定位系统的脆弱性，物理世界攻击实验证明了提案的真实性和通用性，为自动驾驶安全提供了重要警示

Abstract: Deep learning models have been shown to be susceptible to adversarial attacks
with visually imperceptible perturbations. Even this poses a serious security
challenge for the localization of self-driving cars, there has been very little
exploration of attack on it, as most of adversarial attacks have been applied
to 3D perception. In this work, we propose a novel adversarial attack framework
called DisorientLiDAR targeting LiDAR-based localization. By
reverse-engineering localization models (e.g., feature extraction networks),
adversaries can identify critical keypoints and strategically remove them,
thereby disrupting LiDAR-based localization. Our proposal is first evaluated on
three state-of-the-art point-cloud registration models (HRegNet, D3Feat, and
GeoTransformer) using the KITTI dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that
removing regions containing Top-K keypoints significantly degrades their
registration accuracy. We further validate the attack's impact on the Autoware
autonomous driving platform, where hiding merely a few critical regions induces
noticeable localization drift. Finally, we extended our attacks to the physical
world by hiding critical regions with near-infrared absorptive materials,
thereby successfully replicate the attack effects observed in KITTI data. This
step has been closer toward the realistic physical-world attack that
demonstrate the veracity and generality of our proposal.

Conclusion: 通过光谱学习视角和光谱码本方法，能够有效区分和去除反射，在反射去除任务上取得了显著改进

Abstract: Eliminating reflections caused by incident light interacting with reflective
medium remains an ill-posed problem in the image restoration area. The primary
challenge arises from the overlapping of reflection and transmission components
in the captured images, which complicates the task of accurately distinguishing
and recovering the clean background. Existing approaches typically address
reflection removal solely in the image domain, ignoring the spectral property
variations of reflected light, which hinders their ability to effectively
discern reflections. In this paper, we start with a new perspective on spectral
learning, and propose the Spectral Codebook to reconstruct the optical spectrum
of the reflection image. The reflections can be effectively distinguished by
perceiving the wavelength differences between different light sources in the
spectrum. To leverage the reconstructed spectrum, we design two spectral prior
refinement modules to re-distribute pixels in the spatial dimension and
adaptively enhance the spectral differences along the wavelength dimension.
Furthermore, we present the Spectrum-Aware Transformer to jointly recover the
transmitted content in spectral and pixel domains. Experimental results on
three different reflection benchmarks demonstrate the superiority and
generalization ability of our method compared to state-of-the-art models.

Conclusion: CIARD在平衡模型鲁棒性和泛化性方面建立了新的基准，有效解决了现有方法在清洁样本性能下降的问题

Abstract: Adversarial robustness distillation (ARD) aims to transfer both performance
and robustness from teacher model to lightweight student model, enabling
resilient performance on resource-constrained scenarios. Though existing ARD
approaches enhance student model's robustness, the inevitable by-product leads
to the degraded performance on clean examples. We summarize the causes of this
problem inherent in existing methods with dual-teacher framework as: 1. The
divergent optimization objectives of dual-teacher models, i.e., the clean and
robust teachers, impede effective knowledge transfer to the student model, and
2. The iteratively generated adversarial examples during training lead to
performance deterioration of the robust teacher model. To address these
challenges, we propose a novel Cyclic Iterative ARD (CIARD) method with two key
innovations: a. A multi-teacher framework with contrastive push-loss alignment
to resolve conflicts in dual-teacher optimization objectives, and b. Continuous
adversarial retraining to maintain dynamic teacher robustness against
performance degradation from the varying adversarial examples. Extensive
experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet demonstrate that CIARD
achieves remarkable performance with an average 3.53 improvement in adversarial
defense rates across various attack scenarios and a 5.87 increase in clean
sample accuracy, establishing a new benchmark for balancing model robustness
and generalization. Our code is available at https://github.com/eminentgu/CIARD

Conclusion: 该研究填补了语义协调操纵检测的空白，提出的数据集和框架为多模态媒体取证提供了更真实有效的解决方案

Abstract: The detection and grounding of manipulated content in multimodal data has
emerged as a critical challenge in media forensics. While existing benchmarks
demonstrate technical progress, they suffer from misalignment artifacts that
poorly reflect real-world manipulation patterns: practical attacks typically
maintain semantic consistency across modalities, whereas current datasets
artificially disrupt cross-modal alignment, creating easily detectable
anomalies. To bridge this gap, we pioneer the detection of
semantically-coordinated manipulations where visual edits are systematically
paired with semantically consistent textual descriptions. Our approach begins
with constructing the first Semantic-Aligned Multimodal Manipulation (SAMM)
dataset, generated through a two-stage pipeline: 1) applying state-of-the-art
image manipulations, followed by 2) generation of contextually-plausible
textual narratives that reinforce the visual deception. Building on this
foundation, we propose a Retrieval-Augmented Manipulation Detection and
Grounding (RamDG) framework. RamDG commences by harnessing external knowledge
repositories to retrieve contextual evidence, which serves as the auxiliary
texts and encoded together with the inputs through our image forgery grounding
and deep manipulation detection modules to trace all manipulations. Extensive
experiments demonstrate our framework significantly outperforms existing
methods, achieving 2.06\% higher detection accuracy on SAMM compared to
state-of-the-art approaches. The dataset and code are publicly available at
https://github.com/shen8424/SAMM-RamDG-CAP.

Motivation: 跨视角地理定位任务面临显著的外观变化和特征提取困难，现有方法往往忽略空间和语义信息，需要更有效的特征表示方法。

Conclusion: MFAF方法通过频率注意力融合有效提升了跨视角地理定位的性能，解决了视角变化和背景噪声干扰问题。

Abstract: Cross-view geo-localization aims to determine the geographical location of a
query image by matching it against a gallery of images. This task is
challenging due to the significant appearance variations of objects observed
from variable views, along with the difficulty in extracting discriminative
features. Existing approaches often rely on extracting features through feature
map segmentation while neglecting spatial and semantic information. To address
these issues, we propose the EVA02-based Multi-scale Frequency Attention Fusion
(MFAF) method. The MFAF method consists of Multi-Frequency Branch-wise Block
(MFB) and the Frequency-aware Spatial Attention (FSA) module. The MFB block
effectively captures both low-frequency structural features and high-frequency
edge details across multiple scales, improving the consistency and robustness
of feature representations across various viewpoints. Meanwhile, the FSA module
adaptively focuses on the key regions of frequency features, significantly
mitigating the interference caused by background noise and viewpoint
variability. Extensive experiments on widely recognized benchmarks, including
University-1652, SUES-200, and Dense-UAV, demonstrate that the MFAF method
achieves competitive performance in both drone localization and drone
navigation tasks.

TL;DR: 本文对YOLOv8-s、YOLOv9-s、YOLOv10-s和YOLOv11-s在水下图像检测任务上的性能进行了系统比较，发现YOLOv9之后准确率趋于饱和，而YOLOv10在速度和准确率之间提供了最佳平衡，适合自主水下航行器的嵌入式部署。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 水下图像存在光线衰减、浑浊和类别不平衡等问题，而自主水下航行器的计算资源有限。虽然YOLO系列单阶段检测器具有低延迟优势，但其在海洋领域的性能表现尚未得到系统评估。

Method: 使用两个公开可用的水下数据集（珊瑚疾病数据集和鱼类物种数据集），在不同训练数据比例下，用相同超参数训练四个YOLO变体，评估精度、召回率、mAP、推理时间等指标，并使用Grad-CAM进行可视化分析。

Result: 在两个数据集上，YOLOv9之后的准确率趋于饱和，但推理速度显著提升。YOLOv10在速度和准确率之间提供了最佳平衡，适合嵌入式部署。

Conclusion: 研究提供了首个针对水下图像的YOLO变体对比，表明轻量级YOLOv10最适合AUV部署，并为未来海洋视觉研究提供了可复现的基准和代码库。

Abstract: Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) increasingly rely on on-board
computer-vision systems for tasks such as habitat mapping, ecological
monitoring, and infrastructure inspection. However, underwater imagery is
hindered by light attenuation, turbidity, and severe class imbalance, while the
computational resources available on AUVs are limited. One-stage detectors from
the YOLO family are attractive because they fuse localization and
classification in a single, low-latency network; however, their terrestrial
benchmarks (COCO, PASCAL-VOC, Open Images) leave open the question of how
successive YOLO releases perform in the marine domain. We curate two openly
available datasets that span contrasting operating conditions: a Coral Disease
set (4,480 images, 18 classes) and a Fish Species set (7,500 images, 20
classes). For each dataset, we create four training regimes (25 %, 50 %, 75 %,
100 % of the images) while keeping balanced validation and test partitions
fixed. We train YOLOv8-s, YOLOv9-s, YOLOv10-s, and YOLOv11-s with identical
hyperparameters (100 epochs, 640 px input, batch = 16, T4 GPU) and evaluate
precision, recall, mAP50, mAP50-95, per-image inference time, and
frames-per-second (FPS). Post-hoc Grad-CAM visualizations probe feature
utilization and localization faithfulness. Across both datasets, accuracy
saturates after YOLOv9, suggesting architectural innovations primarily target
efficiency rather than accuracy. Inference speed, however, improves markedly.
Our results (i) provide the first controlled comparison of recent YOLO variants
on underwater imagery, (ii) show that lightweight YOLOv10 offers the best
speed-accuracy trade-off for embedded AUV deployment, and (iii) deliver an
open, reproducible benchmark and codebase to accelerate future marine-vision
research.

Abstract: Stereo matching plays a crucial role in enabling depth perception for
autonomous driving and robotics. While recent years have witnessed remarkable
progress in stereo matching algorithms, largely driven by learning-based
methods and synthetic datasets, the generalization performance of these models
remains constrained by the limited diversity of existing training data. To
address these challenges, we present StereoCarla, a high-fidelity synthetic
stereo dataset specifically designed for autonomous driving scenarios. Built on
the CARLA simulator, StereoCarla incorporates a wide range of camera
configurations, including diverse baselines, viewpoints, and sensor placements
as well as varied environmental conditions such as lighting changes, weather
effects, and road geometries. We conduct comprehensive cross-domain experiments
across four standard evaluation datasets (KITTI2012, KITTI2015, Middlebury,
ETH3D) and demonstrate that models trained on StereoCarla outperform those
trained on 11 existing stereo datasets in terms of generalization accuracy
across multiple benchmarks. Furthermore, when integrated into multi-dataset
training, StereoCarla contributes substantial improvements to generalization
accuracy, highlighting its compatibility and scalability. This dataset provides

TL;DR: 提出了一个名为SmokeBench的真实世界监控图像去烟基准数据集，包含不同场景设置和烟雾浓度下的图像对，用于监督学习和严格评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 早期火灾场景（点火后0-15分钟）是紧急干预的关键时间窗口，但烟雾会严重降低监控系统的可见度，影响应急响应和救援操作。目前缺乏大规模真实世界的无烟和烟雾退化图像配对数据集，限制了去烟算法的发展。

Method: 构建了一个真实世界的监控图像去烟基准数据集SmokeBench，包含精确对齐的退化图像和干净图像对，涵盖不同场景设置和烟雾浓度。

Result: 在数据集上对各种去烟方法进行了全面的基准测试实验，为推进真实火灾场景中鲁棒实用的图像去烟技术提供了宝贵基础。

Conclusion: SmokeBench数据集已公开发布，可作为真实世界图像去烟研究的重要基准资源，促进该领域算法的发展。

Abstract: Early-stage fire scenes (0-15 minutes after ignition) represent a crucial
temporal window for emergency interventions. During this stage, the smoke
produced by combustion significantly reduces the visibility of surveillance
systems, severely impairing situational awareness and hindering effective
emergency response and rescue operations. Consequently, there is an urgent need
to remove smoke from images to obtain clear scene information. However, the
development of smoke removal algorithms remains limited due to the lack of
large-scale, real-world datasets comprising paired smoke-free and
smoke-degraded images. To address these limitations, we present a real-world
surveillance image desmoking benchmark dataset named SmokeBench, which contains
image pairs captured under diverse scenes setup and smoke concentration. The
curated dataset provides precisely aligned degraded and clean images, enabling
supervised learning and rigorous evaluation. We conduct comprehensive
experiments by benchmarking a variety of desmoking methods on our dataset. Our
dataset provides a valuable foundation for advancing robust and practical image
desmoking in real-world fire scenes. This dataset has been released to the
public and can be downloaded from https://github.com/ncfjd/SmokeBench.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本驱动的红外与可见光图像融合方法缺乏目标对齐的任务来监督和评估文本对融合结果的有效贡献，发现参考图像分割与文本驱动融合具有共同目标——突出文本所指对象。

Method: 提出级联框架RIS-FUSION，包含LangGatedFusion模块将文本特征注入融合主干网络以增强语义对齐，通过联合优化统一融合和RIS任务，并构建包含12.5k训练和3.5k测试样本的MM-RIS数据集。

Result: 实验表明RIS-FUSION达到最先进性能，在mIoU指标上超过现有方法11%以上。

Conclusion: 通过统一图像融合和参考图像分割任务，RIS-FUSION框架有效实现了文本引导的多模态图像融合，显著提升了性能表现。

Abstract: Text-driven infrared and visible image fusion has gained attention for
enabling natural language to guide the fusion process. However, existing
methods lack a goal-aligned task to supervise and evaluate how effectively the
input text contributes to the fusion outcome. We observe that referring image
segmentation (RIS) and text-driven fusion share a common objective:
highlighting the object referred to by the text. Motivated by this, we propose
RIS-FUSION, a cascaded framework that unifies fusion and RIS through joint
optimization. At its core is the LangGatedFusion module, which injects textual
features into the fusion backbone to enhance semantic alignment. To support
multimodal referring image segmentation task, we introduce MM-RIS, a
large-scale benchmark with 12.5k training and 3.5k testing triplets, each
consisting of an infrared-visible image pair, a segmentation mask, and a
referring expression. Extensive experiments show that RIS-FUSION achieves
state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing methods by over 11% in
mIoU. Code and dataset will be released at

TL;DR: DeFA方法通过解构-重构框架进行特征增强和去偏策略，解决组合零样本学习中的特征纠缠和长尾分布问题，在多个数据集上达到最先进性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 组合零样本学习面临属性和对象特征纠缠以及现实数据长尾分布的挑战，受神经科学发现启发，提出通过想象力增强感知能力

Method: 提出Debiased Feature Augmentation (DeFA)方法，包含解构-重构框架进行特征增强，结合去偏策略，利用已见属性和对象先验知识合成高质量组合特征

Result: 在三个广泛使用的数据集上进行大量实验，证明DeFA在封闭世界和开放世界设置下都达到了最先进的性能

Conclusion: DeFA方法通过特征增强和去偏策略有效解决了组合零样本学习中的关键挑战，为组合泛化提供了有力支持

Abstract: Compositional Zero-Shot Learning (CZSL) aims to recognize unseen
attribute-object compositions by learning prior knowledge of seen primitives,
\textit{i.e.}, attributes and objects. Learning generalizable compositional
representations in CZSL remains challenging due to the entangled nature of
attributes and objects as well as the prevalence of long-tailed distributions
in real-world data. Inspired by neuroscientific findings that imagination and
perception share similar neural processes, we propose a novel approach called
Debiased Feature Augmentation (DeFA) to address these challenges. The proposed
DeFA integrates a disentangle-and-reconstruct framework for feature
augmentation with a debiasing strategy. DeFA explicitly leverages the prior
knowledge of seen attributes and objects by synthesizing high-fidelity
composition features to support compositional generalization. Extensive
experiments on three widely used datasets demonstrate that DeFA achieves
state-of-the-art performance in both \textit{closed-world} and
\textit{open-world} settings.

TL;DR: AsyMoE是一种新颖的混合专家架构，专门针对视觉-语言模型中的模态不对称问题，通过三种专家组设计显著提升了性能并减少了参数量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的混合专家方法在处理视觉和语言模态时面临不对称挑战，视觉信息具有空间完整性而语言需要保持序列上下文，导致深层语言专家逐渐失去上下文基础并过度依赖参数知识。

Method: 提出AsyMoE架构，包含三种专门专家组：模态内专家处理特定模态特征，双曲跨模态专家处理层次化跨模态交互，证据优先语言专家抑制参数偏差并保持上下文基础。

Result: 实验显示AsyMoE相比普通MoE和模态特定MoE分别实现了26.58%和15.45%的准确率提升，同时比密集模型激活参数减少25.45%。

Conclusion: AsyMoE通过建模视觉-语言模态的不对称性，有效解决了现有MoE方法的局限性，在保持高性能的同时显著降低了计算成本。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance
on multimodal tasks through scaled architectures and extensive training.
However, existing Mixture of Experts (MoE) approaches face challenges due to
the asymmetry between visual and linguistic processing. Visual information is
spatially complete, while language requires maintaining sequential context. As
a result, MoE models struggle to balance modality-specific features and
cross-modal interactions. Through systematic analysis, we observe that language
experts in deeper layers progressively lose contextual grounding and rely more
on parametric knowledge rather than utilizing the provided visual and
linguistic information. To address this, we propose AsyMoE, a novel
architecture that models this asymmetry using three specialized expert groups.
We design intra-modality experts for modality-specific processing, hyperbolic
inter-modality experts for hierarchical cross-modal interactions, and
evidence-priority language experts to suppress parametric biases and maintain
contextual grounding. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AsyMoE achieves
26.58% and 15.45% accuracy improvements over vanilla MoE and modality-specific
MoE respectively, with 25.45% fewer activated parameters than dense models.

TL;DR: 提出了两个动态空间推理基准测试，用于评估模型在局部感知、环境反馈和全局目标耦合情况下的空间理解和自适应规划能力，揭示了主流模型在动态空间推理和长期记忆方面的关键局限性。


<details>

Motivation: 现有空间推理基准主要关注静态或全局可观测环境，无法捕捉在部分可观测性和动态变化下的长时程推理和记忆利用挑战。

Method: 引入两个动态空间基准测试：局部可观测迷宫导航和match-2消除任务，提出基于主观经验的记忆机制进行跨任务经验迁移和验证。

Result: 实验表明，这些基准测试能够揭示主流模型在动态空间推理和长期记忆方面的关键局限性。

Conclusion: 该研究为未来方法学进展提供了一个全面的评估平台，代码和数据已开源。

Abstract: Most existing spatial reasoning benchmarks focus on static or globally
observable environments, failing to capture the challenges of long-horizon
reasoning and memory utilization under partial observability and dynamic
changes. We introduce two dynamic spatial benchmarks, locally observable maze
navigation and match-2 elimination that systematically evaluate models'
abilities in spatial understanding and adaptive planning when local perception,
environment feedback, and global objectives are tightly coupled. Each action
triggers structural changes in the environment, requiring continuous update of
cognition and strategy. We further propose a subjective experience-based memory
mechanism for cross-task experience transfer and validation. Experiments show
that our benchmarks reveal key limitations of mainstream models in dynamic
spatial reasoning and long-term memory, providing a comprehensive platform for
future methodological advances. Our code and data are available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SPGen提出了一种基于球面投影的单视图3D生成方法，通过将几何信息投影到边界球面并展开为多层2D表示，解决了传统多视图扩散方法的一致性问题，同时支持复杂内部结构和开放表面。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有单视图3D生成模型依赖多视图扩散先验，容易产生视图不一致问题，且无法准确表示复杂内部结构或非平凡拓扑。需要一种能同时保证一致性、灵活性和效率的新方法。

Method: 将几何信息投影到边界球面并展开为紧凑的结构化多层2D球面投影(SP)表示，完全在图像域操作，直接继承强大的2D扩散先验，支持高效微调。

Result: 大量实验表明，SPGen在几何质量和计算效率方面显著优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: SPGen通过球面投影表示成功解决了单视图3D生成中的一致性问题，同时提供了处理复杂内部结构和开放表面的灵活性，计算效率优异。

Abstract: Existing single-view 3D generative models typically adopt multiview diffusion
priors to reconstruct object surfaces, yet they remain prone to inter-view
inconsistencies and are unable to faithfully represent complex internal
structure or nontrivial topologies. In particular, we encode geometry
information by projecting it onto a bounding sphere and unwrapping it into a
compact and structural multi-layer 2D Spherical Projection (SP) representation.
Operating solely in the image domain, SPGen offers three key advantages
simultaneously: (1) Consistency. The injective SP mapping encodes surface
geometry with a single viewpoint which naturally eliminates view inconsistency
and ambiguity; (2) Flexibility. Multi-layer SP maps represent nested internal
structures and support direct lifting to watertight or open 3D surfaces; (3)
Efficiency. The image-domain formulation allows the direct inheritance of
powerful 2D diffusion priors and enables efficient finetuning with limited
computational resources. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SPGen
significantly outperforms existing baselines in geometric quality and
computational efficiency.

Motivation: RF传感作为视觉方法的隐私保护替代方案，在动态多样的室内环境中收集高质量数据面临挑战，需要一种能够生成真实RF信号的模拟框架。

Method: 引入语言引导的4D世界生成器，包括状态感知因果变换器用于基于空间约束和文本条件的人体运动生成，以及相位相干射线追踪模拟器来模拟准确相干的RF信号。

Result: 实验证明该方法在条件人体运动生成方面有效，相位相干性成功应用于波束成形和呼吸监测。案例研究表明WaveVerse首次实现了RF成像数据生成，在数据有限和充足场景下均能获得性能提升。

Conclusion: WaveVerse提供了一个有效的解决方案，能够生成高质量的RF传感数据，为RF成像和人体活动识别等应用提供了可靠的数据支持。

Abstract: Radio Frequency (RF) sensing has emerged as a powerful, privacy-preserving
alternative to vision-based methods for indoor perception tasks. However,
collecting high-quality RF data in dynamic and diverse indoor environments
remains a major challenge. To address this, we introduce WaveVerse, a
prompt-based, scalable framework that simulates realistic RF signals from
generated indoor scenes with human motions. WaveVerse introduces a
language-guided 4D world generator, which includes a state-aware causal
transformer for human motion generation conditioned on spatial constraints and
texts, and a phase-coherent ray tracing simulator that enables the simulation
of accurate and coherent RF signals. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness
of our approach in conditioned human motion generation and highlight how phase
coherence is applied to beamforming and respiration monitoring. We further
present two case studies in ML-based high-resolution imaging and human activity
recognition, demonstrating that WaveVerse not only enables data generation for
RF imaging for the first time, but also consistently achieves performance gain
in both data-limited and data-adequate scenarios.

TL;DR: 提出Defense2Attack方法，通过将防御机制融入攻击流程来增强对视觉语言模型的越狱效果，在单次尝试中实现更高的攻击成功率和效率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管现有的越狱攻击取得了一定进展，但其效果和效率仍有提升空间。研究发现将弱防御机制整合到攻击流程中可以显著提升越狱的有效性和效率

Method: Defense2Attack包含三个核心组件：1）视觉优化器嵌入具有肯定语义的通用对抗扰动；2）文本优化器使用防御风格提示优化输入；3）通过强化学习微调的红队后缀生成器增强越狱效果

Result: 在4个VLM模型和4个安全基准测试上的实验表明，Defense2Attack在单次尝试中实现了优越的越狱性能，优于需要多次尝试的最先进攻击方法

Conclusion: 该工作为越狱视觉语言模型提供了新的视角，展示了如何通过利用防御模式来指导越狱提示设计，从而有效绕过模型的安全防护机制

Abstract: Despite their superb capabilities, Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have been
shown to be vulnerable to jailbreak attacks. While recent jailbreaks have
achieved notable progress, their effectiveness and efficiency can still be
improved. In this work, we reveal an interesting phenomenon: incorporating weak
defense into the attack pipeline can significantly enhance both the
effectiveness and the efficiency of jailbreaks on VLMs. Building on this
insight, we propose Defense2Attack, a novel jailbreak method that bypasses the
safety guardrails of VLMs by leveraging defensive patterns to guide jailbreak
prompt design. Specifically, Defense2Attack consists of three key components:
(1) a visual optimizer that embeds universal adversarial perturbations with
affirmative and encouraging semantics; (2) a textual optimizer that refines the
input using a defense-styled prompt; and (3) a red-team suffix generator that
enhances the jailbreak through reinforcement fine-tuning. We empirically
evaluate our method on four VLMs and four safety benchmarks. The results
demonstrate that Defense2Attack achieves superior jailbreak performance in a
single attempt, outperforming state-of-the-art attack methods that often
require multiple tries. Our work offers a new perspective on jailbreaking VLMs.

Motivation: 现有高斯泼溅方法采用无差别属性分配导致梯度冲突和表示效率低下，需要更智能的高斯管理策略来提升重建质量和效率。

Method: 引入动态激活球谐函数或法向量的致密化策略，开发基于梯度幅度的自适应球谐阶数调整和任务解耦剪枝的轻量级高斯表示。

Result: 在重建质量和效率方面一致优于最先进方法，以显著更少的参数实现优越性能，且方法具有模型无关性。

Conclusion: 提出的高斯管理方法有效解决了梯度冲突问题，在保持高质量重建的同时大幅减少了参数数量，具有很好的通用性和实用性。

Abstract: This paper proposes an effective Gaussian management approach for
high-fidelity object reconstruction. Departing from recent Gaussian Splatting
(GS) methods that employ indiscriminate attribute assignment, our approach
introduces a novel densification strategy that dynamically activates spherical
harmonics (SHs) or normals under the supervision of a surface reconstruction
module, which effectively mitigates the gradient conflicts caused by dual
supervision and achieves superior reconstruction results. To further improve
representation efficiency, we develop a lightweight Gaussian representation
that adaptively adjusts the SH orders of each Gaussian based on gradient
magnitudes and performs task-decoupled pruning to remove Gaussian with minimal
impact on a reconstruction task without sacrificing others, which balances the
representational capacity with parameter quantity. Notably, our management
approach is model-agnostic and can be seamlessly integrated into other
frameworks, enhancing performance while reducing model size. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art approaches in both reconstruction quality and efficiency,
achieving superior performance with significantly fewer parameters.

Motivation: 研究深度可分离深度网络中学习到的感受野滤波器的数学特性，探索是否可以用离散尺度空间滤波器来近似这些学习到的滤波器。

Method: 首先计算学习滤波器空间分布的加权均值和方差，然后使用离散高斯核的差分算子对聚类得到的主滤波器进行建模，通过两种方式（不同尺度参数和相同尺度参数）进行模型拟合，并比较l1和l2范数。

Conclusion: 深度可分离深度网络中学习到的滤波器可以用离散尺度空间滤波器很好地近似，理想化模型具有良好的预测性能，可以替代原始学习到的滤波器。

Abstract: This paper presents the results of analysing and modelling a set of 8
``master key filters'', which have been extracted by applying a clustering
approach to the receptive fields learned in depthwise-separable deep networks
based on the ConvNeXt architecture.
  For this purpose, we first compute spatial spread measures in terms of
weighted mean values and weighted variances of the absolute values of the
learned filters, which support the working hypotheses that: (i) the learned
filters can be modelled by separable filtering operations over the spatial
domain, and that (ii) the spatial offsets of the those learned filters that are
non-centered are rather close to half a grid unit. Then, we model the clustered
``master key filters'' in terms of difference operators applied to a spatial
smoothing operation in terms of the discrete analogue of the Gaussian kernel,
and demonstrate that the resulting idealized models of the receptive fields
show good qualitative similarity to the learned filters.
  This modelling is performed in two different ways: (i) using possibly
different values of the scale parameters in the coordinate directions for each
filter, and (ii) using the same value of the scale parameter in both coordinate
directions. Then, we perform the actual model fitting by either (i) requiring
spatial spread measures in terms of spatial variances of the absolute values of
the receptive fields to be equal, or (ii) minimizing the discrete $l_1$- or
$l_2$-norms between the idealized receptive field models and the learned
filters.
  Complementary experimental results then demonstrate the idealized models of
receptive fields have good predictive properties for replacing the learned
filters by idealized filters in depthwise-separable deep networks, thus showing
that the learned filters in depthwise-separable deep networks can be well
approximated by discrete scale-space filters.

TL;DR: 本研究分析了多模态LLM与人类在图像质量评估上的差异，发现LLM在理解图像美学、解剖准确性等属性方面与人类存在显著差异


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动化评估文本生成图像模型具有挑战性，现有方法使用多模态LLM但缺乏对其如何利用人类相关概念（如图像风格、构图）的深入理解

Method: 首先策划包含人类偏好的合成图像对数据集，通过属性间相关性分析人类判断机制，然后对LLM进行相同分析，并针对单个图像质量属性生成高可控性的合成数据集

Result: 人类能轻松判断所有特定图像质量属性，但LLM在属性间关系较弱，某些属性（如解剖准确性）对LLM来说更难学习判断

Conclusion: 研究揭示了人类和多模态LLM在图像感知方面存在有趣差异，LLM在理解某些图像质量属性方面与人类认知存在差距

Abstract: Automated evaluation of generative text-to-image models remains a challenging
problem. Recent works have proposed using multimodal LLMs to judge the quality
of images, but these works offer little insight into how multimodal LLMs make
use of concepts relevant to humans, such as image style or composition, to
generate their overall assessment. In this work, we study what attributes of an
image--specifically aesthetics, lack of artifacts, anatomical accuracy,
compositional correctness, object adherence, and style--are important for both
LLMs and humans to make judgments on image quality. We first curate a dataset
of human preferences using synthetically generated image pairs. We use
inter-task correlation between each pair of image quality attributes to
understand which attributes are related in making human judgments. Repeating
the same analysis with LLMs, we find that the relationships between image
quality attributes are much weaker. Finally, we study individual image quality
attributes by generating synthetic datasets with a high degree of control for
each axis. Humans are able to easily judge the quality of an image with respect
to all of the specific image quality attributes (e.g. high vs. low aesthetic
image), however we find that some attributes, such as anatomical accuracy, are
much more difficult for multimodal LLMs to learn to judge. Taken together,
these findings reveal interesting differences between how humans and multimodal
LLMs perceive images.

Motivation: 现有方法将跨视角物体地理定位视为一次性检测任务，直接回归物体位置，容易受到特征噪声影响且缺乏错误修正机制。

Method: 提出循环跨视角物体地理定位Transformer(ReCOT)，使用可学习token编码查询意图，迭代注意力机制精炼位置预测；结合SAM知识蒸馏策略传递分割先验知识，以及参考特征增强模块(RFEM)通过分层注意力强调物体相关区域。

Result: 在标准CVOGL基准测试中达到最先进性能，同时相比之前SOTA方法减少60%参数。

Conclusion: ReCOT通过循环定位框架和知识蒸馏策略，有效解决了跨视角地理定位中的噪声和错误修正问题，在保持高性能的同时显著降低了模型复杂度。

Abstract: Cross-view object geo-localization (CVOGL) aims to determine the location of
a specific object in high-resolution satellite imagery given a query image with
a point prompt. Existing approaches treat CVOGL as a one-shot detection task,
directly regressing object locations from cross-view information aggregation,
but they are vulnerable to feature noise and lack mechanisms for error
correction. In this paper, we propose ReCOT, a Recurrent Cross-view Object
geo-localization Transformer, which reformulates CVOGL as a recurrent
localization task. ReCOT introduces a set of learnable tokens that encode
task-specific intent from the query image and prompt embeddings, and
iteratively attend to the reference features to refine the predicted location.
To enhance this recurrent process, we incorporate two complementary modules:
(1) a SAM-based knowledge distillation strategy that transfers segmentation
priors from the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to provide clearer semantic
guidance without additional inference cost, and (2) a Reference Feature
Enhancement Module (RFEM) that introduces a hierarchical attention to emphasize
object-relevant regions in the reference features. Extensive experiments on
standard CVOGL benchmarks demonstrate that ReCOT achieves state-of-the-art
(SOTA) performance while reducing parameters by 60% compared to previous SOTA
approaches.

TL;DR: A-TDOM是一种基于实时3D高斯泼溅优化的近实时真数字正射影像图生成方法，通过在线SfM计算位姿和稀疏点云，集成新高斯到未重建区域，实现秒级更新和可接受的渲染质量。


<details>

Motivation: 传统TDOM生成方法依赖复杂的离线摄影测量流程，存在延迟问题且质量可能因相机位姿不准、DSM误差和场景遮挡而下降，无法满足实时应用需求。

Method: 基于在线3DGS优化，每获取一张图像即通过在线SfM计算位姿和稀疏点云，将新高斯集成优化到未重建区域，结合正交泼溅技术实现实时渲染。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，A-TDOM能够以近实时方式主动渲染TDOM，每张新图像的3DGS优化仅需数秒，同时保持可接受的渲染质量和几何精度。

Conclusion: A-TDOM方法成功解决了传统TDOM生成的延迟问题，实现了近实时的高质量正射影像生成，为城市管理、规划等领域的实时应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: True Digital Orthophoto Map (TDOM) serves as a crucial geospatial product in
various fields such as urban management, city planning, land surveying, etc.
However, traditional TDOM generation methods generally rely on a complex
offline photogrammetric pipeline, resulting in delays that hinder real-time
applications. Moreover, the quality of TDOM may degrade due to various
challenges, such as inaccurate camera poses or Digital Surface Model (DSM) and
scene occlusions. To address these challenges, this work introduces A-TDOM, a
near real-time TDOM generation method based on On-the-Fly 3DGS optimization. As
each image is acquired, its pose and sparse point cloud are computed via
On-the-Fly SfM. Then new Gaussians are integrated and optimized into previously
unseen or coarsely reconstructed regions. By integrating with orthogonal
splatting, A-TDOM can render just after each update of a new 3DGS field.
Initial experiments on multiple benchmarks show that the proposed A-TDOM is
capable of actively rendering TDOM in near real-time, with 3DGS optimization
for each new image in seconds while maintaining acceptable rendering quality
and TDOM geometric accuracy.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation grapples with challenges including multi-scale
lesion variability, ill-defined tissue boundaries, and computationally
intensive processing demands. This paper proposes the DyGLNet, which achieves
efficient and accurate segmentation by fusing global and local features with a
dynamic upsampling mechanism. The model innovatively designs a hybrid feature
extraction module (SHDCBlock), combining single-head self-attention and
multi-scale dilated convolutions to model local details and global context
collaboratively. We further introduce a dynamic adaptive upsampling module
(DyFusionUp) to realize high-fidelity reconstruction of feature maps based on
learnable offsets. Then, a lightweight design is adopted to reduce
computational overhead. Experiments on seven public datasets demonstrate that
DyGLNet outperforms existing methods, particularly excelling in boundary
accuracy and small-object segmentation. Meanwhile, it exhibits lower
computation complexity, enabling an efficient and reliable solution for
clinical medical image analysis. The code will be made available soon.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BATR-FST是一个用于少样本学习的双层次自适应token优化方法，通过token聚类、不确定性感知权重和双层次注意力机制，在Vision Transformers上实现了优异的少样本分类性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision Transformers在少样本学习中面临token级交互优化不足、训练数据有限和归纳偏置不强等挑战，现有方法依赖不灵活的token匹配或简单相似度度量，限制了全局上下文和局部特征优化的有效整合

Method: 提出双阶段方法：预训练阶段使用掩码图像建模获得可迁移的patch级表示；元微调阶段包含双层次自适应token优化模块（token聚类、不确定性感知token权重、双层次注意力机制）、图token传播确保支持集和查询集的语义一致性，以及类分离惩罚保持类间边界

Result: 在三个基准少样本数据集上的大量实验表明，BATR-FST在1-shot和5-shot场景下均取得了优异结果，显著提升了基于transformer的少样本分类性能

Conclusion: BATR-FST通过渐进式token表示优化和保持强归纳偏置，有效解决了Vision Transformers在少样本学习中的关键挑战，为少样本分类提供了新的有效解决方案

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have shown significant promise in computer vision
applications. However, their performance in few-shot learning is limited by
challenges in refining token-level interactions, struggling with limited
training data, and developing a strong inductive bias. Existing methods often
depend on inflexible token matching or basic similarity measures, which limit
the effective incorporation of global context and localized feature refinement.
To address these challenges, we propose Bi-Level Adaptive Token Refinement for
Few-Shot Transformers (BATR-FST), a two-stage approach that progressively
improves token representations and maintains a robust inductive bias for
few-shot classification. During the pre-training phase, Masked Image Modeling
(MIM) provides Vision Transformers (ViTs) with transferable patch-level
representations by recreating masked image regions, providing a robust basis
for subsequent adaptation. In the meta-fine-tuning phase, BATR-FST incorporates
a Bi-Level Adaptive Token Refinement module that utilizes Token Clustering to
capture localized interactions, Uncertainty-Aware Token Weighting to prioritize
dependable features, and a Bi-Level Attention mechanism to balance
intra-cluster and inter-cluster relationships, thereby facilitating thorough
token refinement. Furthermore, Graph Token Propagation ensures semantic
consistency between support and query instances, while a Class Separation
Penalty preserves different class borders, enhancing discriminative capability.
Extensive experiments on three benchmark few-shot datasets demonstrate that
BATR-FST achieves superior results in both 1-shot and 5-shot scenarios and
improves the few-shot classification via transformers.

Abstract: Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) is the primary imaging technique
that provides valuable spatial-temporal information about lesions, enabling the
accurate diagnosis and subclassification of pancreatic tumors. However, the
high heterogeneity and variability of pancreatic tumors still pose substantial
challenges for precise subtyping diagnosis. Previous methods fail to
effectively explore the contextual information across multiple CECT phases
commonly used in radiologists' diagnostic workflows, thereby limiting their
performance. In this paper, we introduce, for the first time, an automatic way
to combine the multi-phase CECT data to discriminate between pancreatic tumor
subtypes, among which the key is using Mamba with promising learnability and
simplicity to encourage both temporal and spatial modeling from multi-phase
CECT. Specifically, we propose a dual hierarchical contrast-enhanced-aware
Mamba module incorporating two novel spatial and temporal sampling sequences to
explore intra and inter-phase contrast variations of lesions. A
similarity-guided refinement module is also imposed into the temporal scanning
modeling to emphasize the learning on local tumor regions with more obvious
temporal variations. Moreover, we design the space complementary integrator and
multi-granularity fusion module to encode and aggregate the semantics across
different scales, achieving more efficient learning for subtyping pancreatic
tumors. The experimental results on an in-house dataset of 270 clinical cases
achieve an accuracy of 97.4% and an AUC of 98.6% in distinguishing between
pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors
(PNETs), demonstrating its potential as a more accurate and efficient tool.

Conclusion: 该方法通过丰富的上下文表示和关系线索，能够更可靠地推理复杂的上下文依赖交互

Abstract: Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection aims to simultaneously localize
human-object pairs and recognize their interactions. While recent two-stage
approaches have made significant progress, they still face challenges due to
incomplete context modeling. In this work, we introduce a Contextualized
Representation Learning Network that integrates both affordance-guided
reasoning and contextual prompts with visual cues to better capture complex
interactions. We enhance the conventional HOI detection framework by expanding
it beyond simple human-object pairs to include multivariate relationships
involving auxiliary entities like tools. Specifically, we explicitly model the
functional role (affordance) of these auxiliary objects through triplet
structures <human, tool, object>. This enables our model to identify
tool-dependent interactions such as 'filling'. Furthermore, the learnable
prompt is enriched with instance categories and subsequently integrated with
contextual visual features using an attention mechanism. This process aligns
language with image content at both global and regional levels. These
contextualized representations equip the model with enriched relational cues
for more reliable reasoning over complex, context-dependent interactions. Our
proposed method demonstrates superior performance on both the HICO-Det and
V-COCO datasets in most scenarios. Codes will be released upon acceptance.

Conclusion: DH-Diff框架有效解决了合成异常数据生成中的关键挑战，为制造业视觉异常检测提供了高质量的训练数据增强方案。

Abstract: Visual anomaly inspection is critical in manufacturing, yet hampered by the
scarcity of real anomaly samples for training robust detectors. Synthetic data
generation presents a viable strategy for data augmentation; however, current
methods remain constrained by two principal limitations: 1) the generation of
anomalies that are structurally inconsistent with the normal background, and 2)
the presence of undesirable feature entanglement between synthesized images and
their corresponding annotation masks, which undermines the perceptual realism
of the output. This paper introduces Double Helix Diffusion (DH-Diff), a novel
cross-domain generative framework designed to simultaneously synthesize
high-fidelity anomaly images and their pixel-level annotation masks, explicitly
addressing these challenges. DH-Diff employs a unique architecture inspired by
a double helix, cycling through distinct modules for feature separation,
connection, and merging. Specifically, a domain-decoupled attention mechanism
mitigates feature entanglement by enhancing image and annotation features
independently, and meanwhile a semantic score map alignment module ensures
structural authenticity by coherently integrating anomaly foregrounds. DH-Diff
offers flexible control via text prompts and optional graphical guidance.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that DH-Diff significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in diversity and authenticity, leading to significant
improvements in downstream anomaly detection performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统超像素方法依赖低层特征，而深度学习方法虽然利用高层特征但往往牺牲超像素的规则性，导致分割结果准确但可解释性差

Method: 训练模型提取图像特征用于超像素生成，在推理时利用大规模预训练模型进行语义无关分割，确保超像素与对象掩码对齐，支持处理任何先验高层分割和交互式对象聚焦

Result: 综合实验表明SPAM在分割任务上定性和定量都优于最先进方法

Conclusion: SPAM是一个有价值且鲁棒的工具，适用于各种应用场景

Abstract: Superpixels are widely used in computer vision to simplify image
representation and reduce computational complexity. While traditional methods
rely on low-level features, deep learning-based approaches leverage high-level
features but also tend to sacrifice regularity of superpixels to capture
complex objects, leading to accurate but less interpretable segmentations. In
this work, we introduce SPAM (SuperPixel Anything Model), a versatile framework
for segmenting images into accurate yet regular superpixels. We train a model
to extract image features for superpixel generation, and at inference, we
leverage a large-scale pretrained model for semantic-agnostic segmentation to
ensure that superpixels align with object masks. SPAM can handle any prior
high-level segmentation, resolving uncertainty regions, and is able to
interactively focus on specific objects. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate
that SPAM qualitatively and quantitatively outperforms state-of-the-art methods
on segmentation tasks, making it a valuable and robust tool for various
applications. Code and pre-trained models are available here:

Motivation: 传统线性注意力方法对历史键值信息进行均匀压缩，导致特征冗余和查询对齐丢失，造成性能差距

Method: 引入输入自适应的可学习门控机制，选择性调制信息聚合到KV特征图中，并提出高效的Hadamard乘积分解方法进行门计算

Conclusion: SAGA通过选择性门控机制有效缓解了线性注意力的低秩约束问题，在计算效率和模型性能方面都取得了显著改进

Abstract: While Transformer architecture excel at modeling long-range dependencies
contributing to its widespread adoption in vision tasks the quadratic
complexity of softmax-based attention mechanisms imposes a major bottleneck,
particularly when processing high-resolution images. Linear attention presents
a promising alternative by reformulating the attention computation from $(QK)V$
to $Q(KV)$, thereby reducing the complexity from $\mathcal{O}(N^2)$ to
$\mathcal{O}(N)$ while preserving the global receptive field. However, most
existing methods compress historical key-value (KV) information uniformly,
which can lead to feature redundancy and the loss of directional alignment with
the query (Q). This uniform compression results in low-rank $KV$ feature maps,
contributing to a performance gap compared to softmax attention. To mitigate
this limitation, we propose \textbf{S}elective \textbf{A}daptive
\textbf{GA}ting for Efficient and Expressive Linear Attention (SAGA) , which
introduces input-adaptive learnable gates to selectively modulate information
aggregation into the $KV$ feature map. These gates enhance semantic diversity
and alleviate the low-rank constraint inherent in conventional linear
attention. Additionally, we propose an efficient Hadamard-product decomposition
method for gate computation, which introduces no additional memory overhead.
Experiments demonstrate that SAGA achieves a 1.76$\times$ improvement in
throughput and a 2.69$\times$ reduction in peak GPU memory compared to PVT-T at
a resolution of $1280 \times 1280$. Moreover, it improves top-1 accuracy by up
to 4.4\% on the ImageNet dataset, demonstrating both computational efficiency
and model effectiveness.

Motivation: 医学影像基础模型受限于较小数据集，需要系统研究数据规模和预训练范式如何影响医学影像领域的性能表现。

Method: 在单一机构的350万张胸部X光片上持续预训练MI2（CLIP范式）和RAD-DINO（DINOv2范式）两种视觉编码器，保持计算和评估协议一致，评估分类、分割和放射报告生成任务。

Result: MI2在发现相关任务上扩展性更好，RAD-DINO在导管相关任务上表现更强。使用UniCL结合报告和结构化标签持续预训练MI2能提升性能。仅需3万张领域内样本即可在某些任务上超越开源基础模型。

Conclusion: 中心特定的持续预训练具有重要价值，医学机构利用领域内数据可以获得显著的性能提升。

Abstract: Foundation vision encoders such as CLIP and DINOv2, trained on web-scale
data, exhibit strong transfer performance across tasks and datasets. However,
medical imaging foundation models remain constrained by smaller datasets,
limiting our understanding of how data scale and pretraining paradigms affect
performance in this setting. In this work, we systematically study continual
pretraining of two vision encoders, MedImageInsight (MI2) and RAD-DINO
representing the two major encoder paradigms CLIP and DINOv2, on up to 3.5M
chest x-rays from a single institution, holding compute and evaluation
protocols constant. We evaluate on classification (radiology findings, lines
and tubes), segmentation (lines and tubes), and radiology report generation.
While prior work has primarily focused on tasks related to radiology findings,
we include lines and tubes tasks to counterbalance this bias and evaluate a
model's ability to extract features that preserve continuity along elongated
structures. Our experiments show that MI2 scales more effectively for
finding-related tasks, while RAD-DINO is stronger on tube-related tasks.
Surprisingly, continually pretraining MI2 with both reports and structured
labels using UniCL improves performance, underscoring the value of structured
supervision at scale. We further show that for some tasks, as few as 30k
in-domain samples are sufficient to surpass open-weights foundation models.
These results highlight the utility of center-specific continual pretraining,
enabling medical institutions to derive significant performance gains by
utilizing in-domain data.

Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have demonstrated significant potential in
synthesizing novel viewpoints. Evaluating the NeRF-generated outputs, however,
remains a challenge due to the unique artifacts they exhibit, and no individual
metric performs well across all datasets. We hypothesize that combining two
successful metrics, Deep Image Structure and Texture Similarity (DISTS) and
Video Multi-Method Assessment Fusion (VMAF), based on different perceptual
methods, can overcome the limitations of individual metrics and achieve
improved correlation with subjective quality scores. We experiment with two
normalization strategies for the individual metrics and two fusion strategies
to evaluate their impact on the resulting correlation with the subjective
scores. The proposed pipeline is tested on two distinct datasets, Synthetic and
Outdoor, and its performance is evaluated across three different
configurations. We present a detailed analysis comparing the correlation
coefficients of fusion methods and individual scores with subjective scores to
demonstrate the robustness and generalizability of the fusion metrics.

Abstract: It is well-established that more data generally improves AI model
performance. However, data collection can be challenging for certain tasks due
to the rarity of occurrences or high costs. These challenges are evident in our
use case, where we apply AI models to a novel approach for visually documenting
the musculoskeletal condition of dogs. Here, abnormalities are marked as
colored strokes on a body map of a dog. Since these strokes correspond to
distinct muscles or joints, they can be mapped to the textual domain in which
large language models (LLMs) operate. LLMs have demonstrated impressive
capabilities across a wide range of tasks, including medical applications,
offering promising potential for generating synthetic training data. In this
work, we investigate whether LLMs can effectively generate synthetic visual
training data for canine musculoskeletal diagnoses. For this, we developed a
mapping that segments visual documentations into over 200 labeled regions
representing muscles or joints. Using techniques like guided decoding,
chain-of-thought reasoning, and few-shot prompting, we generated 1,000
synthetic visual documentations for patellar luxation (kneecap dislocation)
diagnosis, the diagnosis for which we have the most real-world data. Our
analysis shows that the generated documentations are sensitive to location and
severity of the diagnosis while remaining independent of the dog's sex. We
further generated 1,000 visual documentations for various other diagnoses to
create a binary classification dataset. A model trained solely on this
synthetic data achieved an F1 score of 88% on 70 real-world documentations.
These results demonstrate the potential of LLM-generated synthetic data, which
is particularly valuable for addressing data scarcity in rare diseases. While
our methodology is tailored to the medical domain, the insights and techniques
can be adapted to other fields.

Conclusion: CCS为物体检测器的DevOps式监控提供了稳健的基础，能够在无需标注的情况下有效评估检测器的可靠性。

Abstract: Evaluating object detection models in deployment is challenging because
ground-truth annotations are rarely available. We introduce the Cumulative
Consensus Score (CCS), a label-free metric that enables continuous monitoring
and comparison of detectors in real-world settings. CCS applies test-time data
augmentation to each image, collects predicted bounding boxes across augmented
views, and computes overlaps using Intersection over Union. Maximum overlaps
are normalized and averaged across augmentation pairs, yielding a measure of
spatial consistency that serves as a proxy for reliability without annotations.
In controlled experiments on Open Images and KITTI, CCS achieved over 90%
congruence with F1-score, Probabilistic Detection Quality, and Optimal
Correction Cost. The method is model-agnostic, working across single-stage and
two-stage detectors, and operates at the case level to highlight
under-performing scenarios. Altogether, CCS provides a robust foundation for
DevOps-style monitoring of object detectors.

Motivation: 现有的基于原型的少样本3D点云分割方法面临两个关键挑战：(1) 类内多样性问题 - 原型的有限表示能力无法覆盖类别的全部变化；(2) 集合间不一致性问题 - 从支持集得到的原型与查询特征空间不对齐。

Abstract: Few-shot 3D point cloud semantic segmentation aims to segment novel
categories using a minimal number of annotated support samples. While existing
prototype-based methods have shown promise, they are constrained by two
critical challenges: (1) Intra-class Diversity, where a prototype's limited
representational capacity fails to cover a class's full variations, and (2)
Inter-set Inconsistency, where prototypes derived from the support set are
misaligned with the query feature space. Motivated by the powerful generative
capability of diffusion model, we re-purpose its pre-trained conditional
encoder to provide a novel source of generalizable features for expanding the
prototype's representational range. Under this setup, we introduce the
Prototype Expansion Network (PENet), a framework that constructs big-capacity
prototypes from two complementary feature sources. PENet employs a dual-stream
learner architecture: it retains a conventional fully supervised Intrinsic
Learner (IL) to distill representative features, while introducing a novel
Diffusion Learner (DL) to provide rich generalizable features. The resulting
dual prototypes are then processed by a Prototype Assimilation Module (PAM),
which adopts a novel push-pull cross-guidance attention block to iteratively
align the prototypes with the query space. Furthermore, a Prototype Calibration
Mechanism (PCM) regularizes the final big capacity prototype to prevent
semantic drift. Extensive experiments on the S3DIS and ScanNet datasets
demonstrate that PENet significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods
across various few-shot settings.

TL;DR: Lego-Edit是一个基于多模态大语言模型的指令图像编辑系统，通过模型级工具包和渐进式强化学习，实现了对开放域指令的泛化编辑能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的指令图像编辑方法在训练域外的用户指令上泛化能力不足，限制了实际应用。用户指令极其多样化，需要能够处理开放域指令的通用解决方案。

Method: 1) 构建包含多样化模型和图像处理功能的模型级工具包；2) 采用三阶段渐进式强化学习方法，利用未标注的开放域指令反馈训练MLLM，使其具备通用推理能力。

Result: 在GEdit-Bench和ImgBench上达到最先进性能，展现出对开放域指令的强大推理能力，并能无需额外微调即可使用新引入的编辑工具。

Conclusion: Lego-Edit通过结合模型级工具包和强化学习，有效解决了指令图像编辑的泛化问题，为处理真实世界多样化用户指令提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Instruction-based image editing has garnered significant attention due to its
direct interaction with users. However, real-world user instructions are
immensely diverse, and existing methods often fail to generalize effectively to
instructions outside their training domain, limiting their practical
application. To address this, we propose Lego-Edit, which leverages the
generalization capability of Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM) to
organize a suite of model-level editing tools to tackle this challenge.
Lego-Edit incorporates two key designs: (1) a model-level toolkit comprising
diverse models efficiently trained on limited data and several image
manipulation functions, enabling fine-grained composition of editing actions by
the MLLM; and (2) a three-stage progressive reinforcement learning approach
that uses feedback on unannotated, open-domain instructions to train the MLLM,
equipping it with generalized reasoning capabilities for handling real-world
instructions. Experiments demonstrate that Lego-Edit achieves state-of-the-art
performance on GEdit-Bench and ImgBench. It exhibits robust reasoning
capabilities for open-domain instructions and can utilize newly introduced
editing tools without additional fine-tuning.

TL;DR: 本文提出了针对Rectified Flow模型的高阶反演方法和解耦注意力机制，解决了反演精度低和多模态注意力纠缠的问题，在图像重建和文本引导编辑任务中达到了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rectified Flow模型虽然在生成性能上优于DDIM-based扩散模型，但在实际应用中面临两个主要挑战：(1) 反演精度低导致与源图像的一致性差；(2) 扩散变换器中的多模态注意力纠缠阻碍了精确的注意力控制。

Method: 1. 基于Runge-Kutta微分方程求解器的高效高阶反演方法；2. 提出解耦扩散变换器注意力机制(DDTA)，将文本和图像注意力分离，实现更精确的语义控制。

Result: 在图像重建和文本引导编辑任务上的大量实验表明，该方法在保真度和可编辑性方面达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法有效解决了Rectified Flow模型的两个关键挑战，为实际应用提供了更高质量的图像生成和编辑能力。

Abstract: Rectified flow (RF) models have recently demonstrated superior generative
performance compared to DDIM-based diffusion models. However, in real-world
applications, they suffer from two major challenges: (1) low inversion accuracy
that hinders the consistency with the source image, and (2) entangled
multimodal attention in diffusion transformers, which hinders precise attention
control. To address the first challenge, we propose an efficient high-order
inversion method for rectified flow models based on the Runge-Kutta solver of
differential equations. To tackle the second challenge, we introduce Decoupled
Diffusion Transformer Attention (DDTA), a novel mechanism that disentangles
text and image attention inside the multimodal diffusion transformers, enabling
more precise semantic control. Extensive experiments on image reconstruction
and text-guided editing tasks demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance in terms of fidelity and editability. Code is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出MLLM-Engaged Joint Optimization (MEJO)框架，通过共享-特定解耦学习和协调梯度学习策略，解决手术三元组识别中的任务间和任务内优化冲突问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手术三元组识别面临长尾数据分布问题，现有方法存在任务间表示纠缠导致的优化冲突和类不平衡数据导致的训练冲突

Method: 1) S²D学习方案分解任务共享和特定表示；2) MLLM驱动的概率提示池增强视觉特征；3) 协调梯度学习策略重新平衡头尾类梯度

Result: 在CholecT45和CholecT50数据集上表现出优越性能，有效处理了优化冲突问题

Conclusion: MEJO框架通过解耦表示学习和梯度协调，成功解决了手术场景理解中的多任务优化挑战

Abstract: Surgical triplet recognition, which involves identifying instrument, verb,
target, and their combinations, is a complex surgical scene understanding
challenge plagued by long-tailed data distribution. The mainstream multi-task
learning paradigm benefiting from cross-task collaborative promotion has shown
promising performance in identifying triples, but two key challenges remain: 1)
inter-task optimization conflicts caused by entangling task-generic and
task-specific representations; 2) intra-task optimization conflicts due to
class-imbalanced training data. To overcome these difficulties, we propose the
MLLM-Engaged Joint Optimization (MEJO) framework that empowers both inter- and
intra-task optimization for surgical triplet recognition. For inter-task
optimization, we introduce the Shared-Specific-Disentangled (S$^2$D) learning
scheme that decomposes representations into task-shared and task-specific
components. To enhance task-shared representations, we construct a Multimodal
Large Language Model (MLLM) powered probabilistic prompt pool to dynamically
augment visual features with expert-level semantic cues. Additionally,
comprehensive task-specific cues are modeled via distinct task prompts covering
the temporal-spatial dimensions, effectively mitigating inter-task ambiguities.
To tackle intra-task optimization conflicts, we develop a Coordinated Gradient
Learning (CGL) strategy, which dissects and rebalances the positive-negative
gradients originating from head and tail classes for more coordinated learning
behaviors. Extensive experiments on the CholecT45 and CholecT50 datasets
demonstrate the superiority of our proposed framework, validating its
effectiveness in handling optimization conflicts.

Motivation: 现有导航任务缺乏对协作对话的全面评估，需要引导者推断导航者位置，使通信对任务成功至关重要。

Method: 收集并发布RAIN数据集（人类对话配对逼真环境中的导航轨迹），设计综合基准评估导航和对话，分析不同导航者和引导者模型的影响。

Result: 提出了完整的评估框架，识别了关键挑战，并公开了数据集、代码和评估工具。

Conclusion: DialNav任务和RAIN数据集为具身对话研究提供了重要基础，促进了该领域未来发展。

Abstract: We introduce DialNav, a novel collaborative embodied dialog task, where a
navigation agent (Navigator) and a remote guide (Guide) engage in multi-turn
dialog to reach a goal location. Unlike prior work, DialNav aims for holistic
evaluation and requires the Guide to infer the Navigator's location, making
communication essential for task success. To support this task, we collect and
release the Remote Assistance in Navigation (RAIN) dataset, human-human dialog
paired with navigation trajectories in photorealistic environments. We design a
comprehensive benchmark to evaluate both navigation and dialog, and conduct
extensive experiments analyzing the impact of different Navigator and Guide
models. We highlight key challenges and publicly release the dataset, code, and
evaluation framework to foster future research in embodied dialog.

*Jianfei Zhao,Feng Zhang,Xin Sun,Lingxing Kong,Zhixing Tan,Chong Feng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了跨层视觉平滑（CLVS）方法，通过视觉记忆机制让大视觉语言模型能够持续关注关键物体，从而提升视觉理解能力，特别是在关系和属性理解任务上取得了显著改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大视觉语言模型虽然能准确定位图像中的关键物体，但对这些物体的注意力往往很短暂。作者假设持续关注关键物体可以提升模型的视觉能力。

Method: 提出跨层视觉平滑（CLVS）方法，包含视觉记忆机制：1）在第一层用位置无偏的视觉注意力初始化记忆；2）后续层中视觉注意力会综合考虑先前层的视觉记忆；3）使用不确定性作为视觉理解完成的指标来终止平滑过程。

Result: 在四个基准测试和三个大视觉语言模型上的实验证实了方法的有效性和泛化性。CLVS在各种视觉理解任务上达到了最先进的性能，特别是在关系和属性理解方面有显著提升。

Conclusion: 跨层视觉平滑方法通过维持对关键物体的持续关注，有效提升了大视觉语言模型的视觉理解能力，证明了持续注意力机制的重要性。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) can accurately locate key objects in
images, yet their attention to these objects tends to be very brief. Motivated
by the hypothesis that sustained focus on key objects can improve LVLMs' visual
capabilities, we propose Cross-Layer Vision Smoothing (CLVS). The core idea of
CLVS is to incorporate a vision memory that smooths the attention distribution
across layers. Specifically, we initialize this vision memory with
position-unbiased visual attention in the first layer. In subsequent layers,
the model's visual attention jointly considers the vision memory from previous
layers, while the memory is updated iteratively, thereby maintaining smooth
attention on key objects. Given that visual understanding primarily occurs in
the early and middle layers of the model, we use uncertainty as an indicator of
completed visual understanding and terminate the smoothing process accordingly.
Experiments on four benchmarks across three LVLMs confirm the effectiveness and
generalizability of our method. CLVS achieves state-of-the-art performance on a
variety of visual understanding tasks, with particularly significant
improvements in relation and attribute understanding.

*Guihui Li,Bowei Dong,Kaizhi Dong,Jiayi Li,Haiyong Zheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MSGFusion是一个基于多模态场景图指导的红外与可见光图像融合框架，通过结构化场景图显式建模实体、属性和空间关系，在多个基准测试中显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的深度学习融合方法主要依赖纹理、对比度等低层视觉线索，难以捕捉图像中的高层语义信息。虽然近期尝试引入文本作为语义指导，但依赖非结构化描述，无法显式建模实体、属性和关系，也缺乏空间定位能力。

Method: 提出MSGFusion框架，通过深度耦合来自文本和视觉的结构化场景图，显式表示实体、属性和空间关系，然后通过场景图表示、层次聚合和图驱动融合等连续模块同步优化高层语义和低层细节。

Result: 在多个公共基准测试上的广泛实验表明，MSGFusion显著优于最先进的方法，特别是在细节保持和结构清晰度方面，在下游任务（如低光目标检测、语义分割和医学图像融合）中表现出优异的语义一致性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: MSGFusion通过结构化场景图指导的多模态融合框架，成功解决了传统方法在高层语义捕捉方面的局限性，为红外与可见光图像融合提供了新的有效解决方案。

Abstract: Infrared and visible image fusion has garnered considerable attention owing
to the strong complementarity of these two modalities in complex, harsh
environments. While deep learning-based fusion methods have made remarkable
advances in feature extraction, alignment, fusion, and reconstruction, they
still depend largely on low-level visual cues, such as texture and contrast,
and struggle to capture the high-level semantic information embedded in images.
Recent attempts to incorporate text as a source of semantic guidance have
relied on unstructured descriptions that neither explicitly model entities,
attributes, and relationships nor provide spatial localization, thereby
limiting fine-grained fusion performance. To overcome these challenges, we
introduce MSGFusion, a multimodal scene graph-guided fusion framework for
infrared and visible imagery. By deeply coupling structured scene graphs
derived from text and vision, MSGFusion explicitly represents entities,
attributes, and spatial relations, and then synchronously refines high-level
semantics and low-level details through successive modules for scene graph
representation, hierarchical aggregation, and graph-driven fusion. Extensive
experiments on multiple public benchmarks show that MSGFusion significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, particularly in detail preservation
and structural clarity, and delivers superior semantic consistency and
generalizability in downstream tasks such as low-light object detection,
semantic segmentation, and medical image fusion.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的生成式异常检测方法，通过图像到图像转换实现无异常重建，并使用补丁相似性评分进行精确异常定位，在胸部CT和脑MRI中实现了更好的异常分割效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学影像中正常组织的细微变异（如肺部解剖结构）对现有生成式异常检测方法构成挑战，需要开发能够处理这种变异的新方法。

Method: 采用图像到图像转换进行无异常重建，然后通过观察图像与生成图像对的补丁相似性评分来实现精确的异常定位。

Result: 在胸部CT感染性病变检测和脑MRI缺血性卒中病变分割任务中，像素级异常分割性能显著提升，DICE分数分别相对提高了+1.9%和+4.4%。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效处理医学影像中的正常组织变异，在多个医学影像模态中实现了优于现有重建方法的异常检测和分割性能。

Abstract: Early detection of newly emerging diseases, lesion severity assessment,
differentiation of medical conditions and automated screening are examples for
the wide applicability and importance of anomaly detection (AD) and
unsupervised segmentation in medicine. Normal fine-grained tissue variability
such as present in pulmonary anatomy is a major challenge for existing
generative AD methods. Here, we propose a novel generative AD approach
addressing this issue. It consists of an image-to-image translation for
anomaly-free reconstruction and a subsequent patch similarity scoring between
observed and generated image-pairs for precise anomaly localization. We
validate the new method on chest computed tomography (CT) scans for the
detection and segmentation of infectious disease lesions. To assess
generalizability, we evaluate the method on an ischemic stroke lesion
segmentation task in T1-weighted brain MRI. Results show improved pixel-level
anomaly segmentation in both chest CTs and brain MRIs, with relative DICE score
improvements of +1.9% and +4.4%, respectively, compared to other
state-of-the-art reconstruction-based methods.

TL;DR: T-SiamTPN是一个时间感知的Siamese跟踪框架，通过在SiamTPN架构中加入显式时间建模，解决了空中目标跟踪中的尺度变化、动态背景和遮挡问题，在保持计算效率的同时显著提升了跟踪性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有跟踪器大多关注空间线索而忽视时间依赖性，导致长期跟踪和遮挡情况下鲁棒性有限。基于相关的Siamese跟踪器受限于线性相关操作，难以处理复杂的非线性外观变化。

Method: 扩展SiamTPN架构，引入时间特征融合和基于注意力的交互机制，增强时间一致性和特征表示能力。

Result: 相比基线方法，成功率提升13.7%，精度提升14.7%。在Jetson Nano上实现7.1 FPS的实时运行，计算效率高。

Conclusion: 时间建模对Siamese跟踪框架至关重要，T-SiamTPN为空中目标跟踪提供了一个强大而高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Aerial object tracking remains a challenging task due to scale variations,
dynamic backgrounds, clutter, and frequent occlusions. While most existing
trackers emphasize spatial cues, they often overlook temporal dependencies,
resulting in limited robustness in long-term tracking and under occlusion.
Furthermore, correlation-based Siamese trackers are inherently constrained by
the linear nature of correlation operations, making them ineffective against
complex, non-linear appearance changes. To address these limitations, we
introduce T-SiamTPN, a temporal-aware Siamese tracking framework that extends
the SiamTPN architecture with explicit temporal modeling. Our approach
incorporates temporal feature fusion and attention-based interactions,
strengthening temporal consistency and enabling richer feature representations.
These enhancements yield significant improvements over the baseline and achieve
performance competitive with state-of-the-art trackers. Crucially, despite the
added temporal modules, T-SiamTPN preserves computational efficiency. Deployed
on the resource-constrained Jetson Nano, the tracker runs in real time at 7.1
FPS, demonstrating its suitability for real-world embedded applications without
notable runtime overhead. Experimental results highlight substantial gains:
compared to the baseline, T-SiamTPN improves success rate by 13.7% and
precision by 14.7%. These findings underscore the importance of temporal
modeling in Siamese tracking frameworks and establish T-SiamTPN as a strong and
efficient solution for aerial object tracking. Code is available at:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种针对YOLOv8的三阶段压缩管道，结合稀疏感知训练、结构化通道剪枝和通道知识蒸馏，在VisDrone数据集上实现73.51%参数减少，仅损失2.7% AP50，推理速度从26 FPS提升至68 FPS。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在资源受限设备上高效部署深度学习模型进行空中目标检测，需要在不影响性能的前提下实现显著压缩。

Method: 三阶段压缩管道：1) 稀疏感知训练引入动态稀疏性；2) 利用批量归一化缩放因子进行结构化通道剪枝；3) 使用可调节温度和损失加权的通道知识蒸馏来缓解精度下降。

Result: YOLOv8m参数从25.85M减少到6.85M(减少73.51%)，FLOPs从49.6G减少到13.3G，MACs从101G减少到34.5G，AP50仅下降2.7%至47.9，推理速度从26 FPS提升到45 FPS。使用TensorRT后进一步提升到68 FPS。

Conclusion: 该方法在保持检测精度的同时显著减少了模型复杂度和计算需求，证明了在资源受限的高吞吐量场景中的实用性。

Abstract: Efficient deployment of deep learning models for aerial object detection on
resource-constrained devices requires significant compression without
com-promising performance. In this study, we propose a novel three-stage
compression pipeline for the YOLOv8 object detection model, integrating
sparsity-aware training, structured channel pruning, and Channel-Wise Knowledge
Distillation (CWD). First, sparsity-aware training introduces dynamic sparsity
during model optimization, effectively balancing parameter reduction and
detection accuracy. Second, we apply structured channel pruning by leveraging
batch normalization scaling factors to eliminate redundant channels,
significantly reducing model size and computational complexity. Finally, to
mitigate the accuracy drop caused by pruning, we employ CWD to transfer
knowledge from the original model, using an adjustable temperature and loss
weighting scheme tailored for small and medium object detection. Extensive
experiments on the VisDrone dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach across multiple YOLOv8 variants. For YOLOv8m, our method reduces model
parameters from 25.85M to 6.85M (a 73.51% reduction), FLOPs from 49.6G to
13.3G, and MACs from 101G to 34.5G, while reducing AP50 by only 2.7%. The
resulting compressed model achieves 47.9 AP50 and boosts inference speed from
26 FPS (YOLOv8m baseline) to 45 FPS, enabling real-time deployment on edge
devices. We further apply TensorRT as a lightweight optimization step. While
this introduces a minor drop in AP50 (from 47.9 to 47.6), it significantly
improves inference speed from 45 to 68 FPS, demonstrating the practicality of
our approach for high-throughput, re-source-constrained scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的点云配准质量验证方法都采用分类方式，只能将配准质量划分为少数几个类别，无法提供精细的量化评估。本文旨在通过回归方法实现更精确的配准误差估计。

Method: 使用回归方法进行点云配准质量验证，扩展了先前使用的错位相关特征，采用多尺度特征提取和基于注意力的聚合机制，特别适用于具有异质空间密度的点云。

Result: 该方法在多样化数据集上实现了准确和鲁棒的配准误差估计，特别是在空间密度异质的点云上表现优异。在指导下游建图任务时，相比最先进的分类方法显著提高了给定重配准帧数下的建图质量。

Conclusion: 回归方法比分类方法更适合点云配准质量验证任务，能够提供更精细的质量量化，多尺度特征提取和注意力聚合机制有效提升了方法性能，特别是在处理异质密度点云时优势明显。

Abstract: Point cloud registration (PCR) is crucial for many downstream tasks, such as
simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) and object tracking. This makes
detecting and quantifying registration misalignment, i.e.,~{\it PCR quality
validation}, an important task. All existing methods treat validation as a
classification task, aiming to assign the PCR quality to a few classes. In this
work, we instead use regression for PCR validation, allowing for a more
fine-grained quantification of the registration quality. We also extend
previously used misalignment-related features by using multiscale extraction
and attention-based aggregation. This leads to accurate and robust registration
error estimation on diverse datasets, especially for point clouds with
heterogeneous spatial densities. Furthermore, when used to guide a mapping
downstream task, our method significantly improves the mapping quality for a
given amount of re-registered frames, compared to the state-of-the-art
classification-based method.

Motivation: 现有的自监督3D重建方法在动态物体重建方面存在困难，主要由于运动估计不准确和时间一致性弱，导致动态场景元素的重建不完整或失真。

Method: 提出了4D雷达辅助的高斯初始化方案，利用4D雷达的速度和空间信息分割动态物体并恢复单目深度尺度；设计了速度引导的点跟踪模型（VGPT），在场景流监督下联合训练，跟踪细粒度动态轨迹并构建时间一致的表示。

Conclusion: 4DRadar-GS通过整合4D雷达信息，有效解决了动态驾驶场景中3D重建的挑战，为自动驾驶系统的验证和感知模型训练提供了更准确的动态场景重建能力。

Abstract: 3D reconstruction and novel view synthesis are critical for validating
autonomous driving systems and training advanced perception models. Recent
self-supervised methods have gained significant attention due to their
cost-effectiveness and enhanced generalization in scenarios where annotated
bounding boxes are unavailable. However, existing approaches, which often rely
on frequency-domain decoupling or optical flow, struggle to accurately
reconstruct dynamic objects due to imprecise motion estimation and weak
temporal consistency, resulting in incomplete or distorted representations of
dynamic scene elements. To address these challenges, we propose 4DRadar-GS, a
4D Radar-augmented self-supervised 3D reconstruction framework tailored for
dynamic driving scenes. Specifically, we first present a 4D Radar-assisted
Gaussian initialization scheme that leverages 4D Radar's velocity and spatial
information to segment dynamic objects and recover monocular depth scale,
generating accurate Gaussian point representations. In addition, we propose a
Velocity-guided PointTrack (VGPT) model, which is jointly trained with the
reconstruction pipeline under scene flow supervision, to track fine-grained
dynamic trajectories and construct temporally consistent representations.
Evaluated on the OmniHD-Scenes dataset, 4DRadar-GS achieves state-of-the-art
performance in dynamic driving scene 3D reconstruction.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的3D高斯泼溅语义理解方法，通过对象级高斯分解和多视角CLIP特征聚合，实现准确的开放词汇对象检索和任务适配，解决了传统方法中语义模糊的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D高斯泼溅技术在实时逼真渲染方面取得显著进展，但其固有的模糊性限制了在AR/VR和机器人等领域的3D场景理解应用。现有方法通过2D基础模型蒸馏学习语义，但存在alpha混合平均语义的根本局限性。

Method: 利用预分解的对象级高斯，通过多视角CLIP特征聚合为每个对象创建全面的"嵌入包"，完全绕过可微分渲染进行语义处理。支持开放词汇对象检索和任务适配（2D分割或3D提取）。

Result: 实验表明该方法有效克服了3D开放词汇对象提取的挑战，同时在2D开放词汇分割方面与最先进方法性能相当，确保最小妥协。

Conclusion: 该方法为3D高斯泼溅的语义理解提供了范式转变的解决方案，通过对象级嵌入表示实现了准确的3D场景理解，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Novel view synthesis has seen significant advancements with 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS), enabling real-time photorealistic rendering. However, the
inherent fuzziness of Gaussian Splatting presents challenges for 3D scene
understanding, restricting its broader applications in AR/VR and robotics.
While recent works attempt to learn semantics via 2D foundation model
distillation, they inherit fundamental limitations: alpha blending averages
semantics across objects, making 3D-level understanding impossible. We propose
a paradigm-shifting alternative that bypasses differentiable rendering for
semantics entirely. Our key insight is to leverage predecomposed object-level
Gaussians and represent each object through multiview CLIP feature aggregation,
creating comprehensive "bags of embeddings" that holistically describe objects.
This allows: (1) accurate open-vocabulary object retrieval by comparing text
queries to object-level (not Gaussian-level) embeddings, and (2) seamless task
adaptation: propagating object IDs to pixels for 2D segmentation or to
Gaussians for 3D extraction. Experiments demonstrate that our method
effectively overcomes the challenges of 3D open-vocabulary object extraction
while remaining comparable to state-of-the-art performance in 2D
open-vocabulary segmentation, ensuring minimal compromise.

Abstract: The integration of event cameras and spiking neural networks holds great
promise for energy-efficient visual processing. However, the limited
availability of event data and the sparse nature of DVS outputs pose challenges
for effective training. Although some prior work has attempted to transfer
semantic knowledge from RGB datasets to DVS, they often overlook the
significant distribution gap between the two modalities. In this paper, we
propose Time-step Mixup knowledge transfer (TMKT), a novel fine-grained mixing
strategy that exploits the asynchronous nature of SNNs by interpolating RGB and
DVS inputs at various time-steps. To enable label mixing in cross-modal
scenarios, we further introduce modality-aware auxiliary learning objectives.
These objectives support the time-step mixup process and enhance the model's
ability to discriminate effectively across different modalities. Our approach
enables smoother knowledge transfer, alleviates modality shift during training,
and achieves superior performance in spiking image classification tasks.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method across
multiple datasets. The code will be released after the double-blind review
process.

*Robin Schön,Julian Lorenz,Katja Ludwig,Daniel Kienzle,Rainer Lienhart*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于用户点击的多模态多表面交互式分割方法，通过融合RGB图像、非RGB模态、错误掩码和编码点击来预测改进的分割掩码，显著减少了所需点击次数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多表面同时存在于同一图像中的复杂分割问题，这些表面可能高度纠缠和相邻，需要新的评估指标和方法来处理这种挑战性场景。

Method: 采用网络架构，输入包括RGB图像、多种非RGB模态、错误掩码和编码点击，设计满足两个条件：RGB主干网络作为黑盒使用，交互特定信息在图像特征提取和多模态融合后集成以减少响应时间。

Result: 多模态融合策略有效，在DeLiVER数据集上平均每表面减少1.28次点击（NoC@90），在MFNet上减少1.19次点击。RGB-only基线在经典单掩码交互分割场景中也表现出竞争性甚至更优的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了多表面交互分割的挑战，多模态输入显著提升了分割效率，同时保持了在传统场景下的良好性能。

Abstract: In this paper, we present a method to interactively create segmentation masks
on the basis of user clicks. We pay particular attention to the segmentation of
multiple surfaces that are simultaneously present in the same image. Since
these surfaces may be heavily entangled and adjacent, we also present a novel
extended evaluation metric that accounts for the challenges of this scenario.
Additionally, the presented method is able to use multi-modal inputs to
facilitate the segmentation task. At the center of this method is a network
architecture which takes as input an RGB image, a number of non-RGB modalities,
an erroneous mask, and encoded clicks. Based on this input, the network
predicts an improved segmentation mask. We design our architecture such that it
adheres to two conditions: (1) The RGB backbone is only available as a
black-box. (2) To reduce the response time, we want our model to integrate the
interaction-specific information after the image feature extraction and the
multi-modal fusion. We refer to the overall task as Multi-Modal Multi-Surface
interactive segmentation (MMMS). We are able to show the effectiveness of our
multi-modal fusion strategy. Using additional modalities, our system reduces
the NoC@90 by up to 1.28 clicks per surface on average on DeLiVER and up to
1.19 on MFNet. On top of this, we are able to show that our RGB-only baseline
achieves competitive, and in some cases even superior performance when tested
in a classical, single-mask interactive segmentation scenario.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FEST竞赛旨在推动历史手写文档的少样本文本行分割方法开发，参赛者只需使用每份手稿的3张标注图像进行训练，以解决标注数据稀缺的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 历史手写文档的文本行分割面临独特挑战：笔迹不规则、墨水褪色、复杂布局和重叠行。标注数据稀缺使完全监督学习方法不实用，需要开发少样本学习方法。

Method: 举办FEST竞赛，使用U-DIADS-TL数据集，要求参与者仅用每份手稿的3张标注图像进行训练，开发能够处理多样化布局和退化情况的文本行分割系统。

Result: 竞赛数据集包含多种古代手稿，具有广泛的布局、退化程度和非标准格式，真实反映实际条件，为少样本学习方法提供测试平台。

Conclusion: 通过强调少样本学习，FEST竞赛旨在促进开发鲁棒且适应性强的方法，使人文学者只需最少的手动标注工作就能使用自动化文档分析工具，推动历史研究中自动化工具的更广泛采用。

Abstract: Text line segmentation is a critical step in handwritten document image
analysis. Segmenting text lines in historical handwritten documents, however,
presents unique challenges due to irregular handwriting, faded ink, and complex
layouts with overlapping lines and non-linear text flow. Furthermore, the
scarcity of large annotated datasets renders fully supervised learning
approaches impractical for such materials. To address these challenges, we
introduce the Few-Shot Text Line Segmentation of Ancient Handwritten Documents
(FEST) Competition. Participants are tasked with developing systems capable of
segmenting text lines in U-DIADS-TL dataset, using only three annotated images
per manuscript for training. The competition dataset features a diverse
collection of ancient manuscripts exhibiting a wide range of layouts,
degradation levels, and non-standard formatting, closely reflecting real-world
conditions. By emphasizing few-shot learning, FEST competition aims to promote
the development of robust and adaptable methods that can be employed by
humanities scholars with minimal manual annotation effort, thus fostering
broader adoption of automated document analysis tools in historical research.

Abstract: This SHREC 2025 track dedicated to protein surface shape retrieval involved 9
participating teams. We evaluated the performance in retrieval of 15 proposed
methods on a large dataset of 11,555 protein surfaces with calculated
electrostatic potential (a key molecular surface descriptor). The performance
in retrieval of the proposed methods was evaluated through different metrics
(Accuracy, Balanced accuracy, F1 score, Precision and Recall). The best
retrieval performance was achieved by the proposed methods that used the
electrostatic potential complementary to molecular surface shape. This
observation was also valid for classes with limited data which highlights the
importance of taking into account additional molecular surface descriptors.

TL;DR: WINNER提出了一种针对SIREN网络的权重初始化方法，通过高斯噪声扰动来解决SIREN在拟合频谱不匹配信号时的'频谱瓶颈'问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SIREN网络在初始化不当时，对于频谱与其频率支持不匹配的信号会出现'频谱瓶颈'现象，导致模型输出接近零且无法恢复在其表示能力范围内的频率分量

Method: WINNER方法对均匀初始化的SIREN权重添加高斯噪声扰动，噪声尺度根据目标信号的频谱质心自适应确定，类似于随机傅里叶嵌入但无需引入额外可训练参数

Result: 在音频拟合任务中达到最先进水平，在图像和3D形状拟合任务中相比基础SIREN有显著提升

Conclusion: WINNER不仅解决了SIREN的频谱瓶颈问题，还为深度神经网络训练提供了新的自适应、目标感知初始化策略方向

Abstract: We identify and address a fundamental limitation of sinusoidal representation
networks (SIRENs), a class of implicit neural representations. SIRENs Sitzmann
et al. (2020), when not initialized appropriately, can struggle at fitting
signals that fall outside their frequency support. In extreme cases, when the
network's frequency support misaligns with the target spectrum, a 'spectral
bottleneck' phenomenon is observed, where the model yields to a near-zero
output and fails to recover even the frequency components that are within its
representational capacity. To overcome this, we propose WINNER - Weight
Initialization with Noise for Neural Representations. WINNER perturbs uniformly
initialized weights of base SIREN with Gaussian noise - whose noise scales are
adaptively determined by the spectral centroid of the target signal. Similar to
random Fourier embeddings, this mitigates 'spectral bias' but without
introducing additional trainable parameters. Our method achieves
state-of-the-art audio fitting and significant gains in image and 3D shape
fitting tasks over base SIREN. Beyond signal fitting, WINNER suggests new
avenues in adaptive, target-aware initialization strategies for optimizing deep
neural network training. For code and data visit

Conclusion: 全向视觉在具身AI时代具有重要价值，PANORAMA架构为构建鲁棒的通用全向AI系统提供了框架，但仍面临开放挑战需要进一步研究

Abstract: Omnidirectional vision, using 360-degree vision to understand the
environment, has become increasingly critical across domains like robotics,
industrial inspection, and environmental monitoring. Compared to traditional
pinhole vision, omnidirectional vision provides holistic environmental
awareness, significantly enhancing the completeness of scene perception and the
reliability of decision-making. However, foundational research in this area has
historically lagged behind traditional pinhole vision. This talk presents an
emerging trend in the embodied AI era: the rapid development of omnidirectional
vision, driven by growing industrial demand and academic interest. We highlight
recent breakthroughs in omnidirectional generation, omnidirectional perception,
omnidirectional understanding, and related datasets. Drawing on insights from
both academia and industry, we propose an ideal panoramic system architecture
in the embodied AI era, PANORAMA, which consists of four key subsystems.
Moreover, we offer in-depth opinions related to emerging trends and
cross-community impacts at the intersection of panoramic vision and embodied
AI, along with the future roadmap and open challenges. This overview
synthesizes state-of-the-art advancements and outlines challenges and
opportunities for future research in building robust, general-purpose
omnidirectional AI systems in the embodied AI era.

Abstract: In this report, we address the problem of determining whether a user performs
an action incorrectly from egocentric video data. To handle the challenges
posed by subtle and infrequent mistakes, we propose a Dual-Stage Reweighted
Mixture-of-Experts (DR-MoE) framework. In the first stage, features are
extracted using a frozen ViViT model and a LoRA-tuned ViViT model, which are
combined through a feature-level expert module. In the second stage, three
classifiers are trained with different objectives: reweighted cross-entropy to
mitigate class imbalance, AUC loss to improve ranking under skewed
distributions, and label-aware loss with sharpness-aware minimization to
enhance calibration and generalization. Their predictions are fused using a
classification-level expert module. The proposed method achieves strong
performance, particularly in identifying rare and ambiguous mistake instances.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 使用现代视觉基础模型(VFM)的简单线性分类器在AI生成图像检测任务中显著优于专用检测器，在真实场景中准确率提升超过20%。研究发现VFM通过文本-图像对齐学习了伪造相关概念，但这种能力依赖于预训练数据的时间范围。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的AI生成图像专用检测器在精心策划的基准测试上表现良好，但在真实世界场景中失败严重，假阴性率极高。研究者希望找到更有效的解决方案。

Method: 采用现代视觉基础模型(VFM)上的简单线性分类器，通过分析文本-图像相似性来探测模型是否学习了伪造相关概念，并使用在VFM预训练截止日期后收集的新数据集进行验证。

Result: 基于VFM的基线方法在相同数据训练下显著优于专用检测器，真实世界准确率提升超过20%。研究发现近期VLM确实学习了将合成图像与伪造概念对齐，但这种能力在未见过的后期数据上急剧下降。

Conclusion: 1) 更新的VFM原始能力比静态检测器的精心设计更有效；2) 真正的泛化评估需要测试数据独立于模型的整个训练历史，包括预训练阶段。

Abstract: While specialized detectors for AI-generated images excel on curated
benchmarks, they fail catastrophically in real-world scenarios, as evidenced by
their critically high false-negative rates on `in-the-wild' benchmarks. Instead
of crafting another specialized `knife' for this problem, we bring a `gun' to
the fight: a simple linear classifier on a modern Vision Foundation Model
(VFM). Trained on identical data, this baseline decisively `outguns' bespoke
detectors, boosting in-the-wild accuracy by a striking margin of over 20\%.
  Our analysis pinpoints the source of the VFM's `firepower': First, by probing
text-image similarities, we find that recent VLMs (e.g., Perception Encoder,
Meta CLIP2) have learned to align synthetic images with forgery-related
concepts (e.g., `AI-generated'), unlike previous versions. Second, we speculate
that this is due to data exposure, as both this alignment and overall accuracy
plummet on a novel dataset scraped after the VFM's pre-training cut-off date,
ensuring it was unseen during pre-training. Our findings yield two critical
conclusions: 1) For the real-world `gunfight' of AI-generated image detection,
the raw `firepower' of an updated VFM is far more effective than the
`craftsmanship' of a static detector. 2) True generalization evaluation
requires test data to be independent of the model's entire training history,
including pre-training.

Result: 系统能耗比边缘GPU解决方案低几个数量级，可电池供电运行一年以上，模型主要依赖无人机形状而非螺旋桨的时间特征

Conclusion: 系统体积小、功耗低，可在争议区域或缺乏电力基础设施的地点轻松部署

Abstract: Small drones are an increasing threat to both military personnel and civilian
infrastructure, making early and automated detection crucial. In this work we
develop a system that uses spiking neural networks and neuromorphic cameras
(event cameras) to detect drones. The detection model is deployed on a
neuromorphic chip making this a fully neuromorphic system. Multiple detection
units can be deployed to create a virtual tripwire which detects when and where
drones enter a restricted zone. We show that our neuromorphic solution is
several orders of magnitude more energy efficient than a reference solution
deployed on an edge GPU, allowing the system to run for over a year on battery
power. We investigate how synthetically generated data can be used for
training, and show that our model most likely relies on the shape of the drone
rather than the temporal characteristics of its propellers. The small size and
low power consumption allows easy deployment in contested areas or locations
that lack power infrastructure.

TL;DR: Dream3DAvatar是一个高效、文本可控的两阶段3D头像生成框架，通过多视图生成和3D重建技术解决单图像重建中的遮挡区域控制问题，在多个评估指标上优于现有基线方法。


<details>

Motivation: 单图像3D头像重建任务由于单目输入信息有限，本质上是不适定的，难以在生成过程中控制遮挡区域的几何和纹理。

Method: 两阶段框架：第一阶段使用轻量级适配器增强的多视图生成模型（包含Pose-Adapter和ID-Adapter-G），第二阶段使用前馈Transformer模型配合多视图特征融合模块重建3D高斯溅射表示，并引入ID-Adapter-R改进高频细节恢复。

Conclusion: Dream3DAvatar通过创新的两阶段设计和适配器机制，有效解决了单图像3D头像重建中的遮挡区域控制问题，实现了高质量的文本可控3D头像生成。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of 3D representation techniques and generative
models, substantial progress has been made in reconstructing full-body 3D
avatars from a single image. However, this task remains fundamentally
ill-posedness due to the limited information available from monocular input,
making it difficult to control the geometry and texture of occluded regions
during generation. To address these challenges, we redesign the reconstruction
pipeline and propose Dream3DAvatar, an efficient and text-controllable
two-stage framework for 3D avatar generation. In the first stage, we develop a
lightweight, adapter-enhanced multi-view generation model. Specifically, we
introduce the Pose-Adapter to inject SMPL-X renderings and skeletal information
into SDXL, enforcing geometric and pose consistency across views. To preserve
facial identity, we incorporate ID-Adapter-G, which injects high-resolution
facial features into the generation process. Additionally, we leverage BLIP2 to
generate high-quality textual descriptions of the multi-view images, enhancing
text-driven controllability in occluded regions. In the second stage, we design
a feedforward Transformer model equipped with a multi-view feature fusion
module to reconstruct high-fidelity 3D Gaussian Splat representations (3DGS)
from the generated images. Furthermore, we introduce ID-Adapter-R, which
utilizes a gating mechanism to effectively fuse facial features into the
reconstruction process, improving high-frequency detail recovery. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method can generate realistic, animation-ready
3D avatars without any post-processing and consistently outperforms existing
baselines across multiple evaluation metrics.

Motivation: 现有RL方法直接从LLMs移植到VLMs效果不佳，因为VLMs需要先准确感知视觉输入才能进行有效推理，任务更加复杂

Method: 两阶段强化学习框架：第一阶段通过粗粒度和细粒度视觉理解提升视觉感知能力，第二阶段专注于增强推理能力；采用数据集级采样解决RL训练中的优势消失问题

Conclusion: 提出的两阶段RL框架成功解决了VLMs中感知和推理能力联合增强的问题，为视觉语言模型的强化学习训练提供了有效方案

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has proven highly effective in eliciting the
reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Inspired by this
success, recent studies have explored applying similar techniques to
vision-language models (VLMs), aiming to enhance their reasoning performance.
However, directly transplanting RL methods from LLMs to VLMs is suboptimal, as
the tasks faced by VLMs are inherently more complex. Specifically, VLMs must
first accurately perceive and understand visual inputs before reasoning can be
effectively performed. To address this challenge, we propose a two-stage
reinforcement learning framework designed to jointly enhance both the
perceptual and reasoning capabilities of VLMs. To mitigate the vanishing
advantage issue commonly observed in RL training, we first perform
dataset-level sampling to selectively strengthen specific capabilities using
distinct data sources. During training, the first stage focuses on improving
the model's visual perception through coarse- and fine-grained visual
understanding, while the second stage targets the enhancement of reasoning
abilities. After the proposed two-stage reinforcement learning process, we
obtain PeBR-R1, a vision-language model with significantly enhanced perceptual
and reasoning capabilities. Experimental results on seven benchmark datasets
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and validate the superior
performance of PeBR-R1 across diverse visual reasoning tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HR-LVLMs通过将高分辨率图像裁剪成局部图块并独立编码，展现出卓越的细粒度视觉理解能力，但这种分治范式显著增加了视觉token数量，导致计算和内存开销大幅增加。

Method: 提出HERO框架，整合内容自适应token预算分配与功能感知token选择。通过准确估计图块级重要性，并选择性保留具有互补作用的视觉token。

Conclusion: 该研究为HR-LVLMs的高效推理提供了实证见解和实用解决方案，通过智能token选择显著降低了计算开销。

Abstract: By cropping high-resolution images into local tiles and encoding them
independently, High-Resolution Large Vision-Language Models (HR-LVLMs) have
demonstrated remarkable fine-grained visual understanding capabilities.
However, this divide-and-conquer paradigm significantly increases the number of
visual tokens, resulting in substantial computational and memory overhead. To
better understand and address this challenge, we empirically investigate visual
token utilization in HR-LVLMs and uncover three key findings: (1) the local
tiles have varying importance, jointly determined by visual saliency and task
relevance; (2) the CLS token in CLIP-based vision encoders exhibits a two-stage
attention pattern across layers, with each stage attending to different types
of visual tokens; (3) the visual tokens emphasized at different stages encode
information at varying levels of granularity, playing complementary roles
within LVLMs. Building on these insights, we propose HERO, a High-resolution
visual token early dropping framework that integrates content-adaptive token
budget allocation with function-aware token selection. By accurately estimating
tile-level importance and selectively retaining visual tokens with
complementary roles, HERO achieves superior efficiency-accuracy trade-offs
across diverse benchmarks and model scales, all in a training-free manner. This
study provides both empirical insights and practical solutions toward efficient
inference in HR-LVLMs.

Motivation: 现有的指代图像分割方法在多模态对齐和语言语义保持方面存在不足，特别是在包含多个视觉相似对象的复杂场景中，经常出现目标定位错误或不完整分割的问题。

Conclusion: TFANet通过系统性的三阶段特征对齐框架，有效解决了多模态错位和语言语义损失问题，特别适用于包含多个视觉相似对象的复杂指代图像分割场景。

Abstract: Referring Image Segmentation (RIS) is a task that segments image regions
based on language expressions, requiring fine-grained alignment between two
modalities. However, existing methods often struggle with multimodal
misalignment and language semantic loss, especially in complex scenes
containing multiple visually similar objects, where uniquely described targets
are frequently mislocalized or incompletely segmented. To tackle these
challenges, this paper proposes TFANet, a Three-stage Image-Text Feature
Alignment Network that systematically enhances multimodal alignment through a
hierarchical framework comprising three stages: Knowledge Plus Stage (KPS),
Knowledge Fusion Stage (KFS), and Knowledge Intensification Stage (KIS). In the
first stage, we design the Multiscale Linear Cross-Attention Module (MLAM),
which facilitates bidirectional semantic exchange between visual features and
textual representations across multiple scales. This establishes rich and
efficient alignment between image regions and different granularities of
linguistic descriptions. Subsequently, the KFS further strengthens feature
alignment through the Cross-modal Feature Scanning Module (CFSM), which applies
multimodal selective scanning to capture long-range dependencies and construct
a unified multimodal representation. This is essential for modeling long-range
cross-modal dependencies and enhancing alignment accuracy in complex scenes.
Finally, in the KIS, we propose the Word-level Linguistic Feature-guided
Semantic Deepening Module (WFDM) to compensate for semantic degradation
introduced in earlier stages.

Motivation: 传统傅里叶频率信息拟合使用像素级损失函数，过度关注局部信息可能导致全局信息丢失，需要更有效的傅里叶域信息对齐方法。

Method: 提出U型深度增强网络LLFDisc，集成交叉注意力和门控机制；设计分布感知损失函数，使用闭式KL散度目标最小化傅里叶域信息差异；增强基于VGG的感知损失，在深度特征中嵌入KL散度。

Result: 在多个基准测试的定性和定量评估中均达到最先进性能，证明方法在傅里叶域信息对齐和结构保真度方面的有效性。

Conclusion: LLFDisc通过创新的分布感知损失和频率感知增强架构，显著提升了傅里叶域信息拟合的效果，为图像增强任务提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: In the Fourier domain, luminance information is primarily encoded in the
amplitude spectrum, while spatial structures are captured in the phase
components. The traditional Fourier Frequency information fitting employs
pixel-wise loss functions, which tend to focus excessively on local information
and may lead to global information loss. In this paper, we present LLFDisc, a
U-shaped deep enhancement network that integrates cross-attention and gating
mechanisms tailored for frequency-aware enhancement. We propose a novel
distribution-aware loss that directly fits the Fourier-domain information and
minimizes their divergence using a closed-form KL-Divergence objective. This
enables the model to align Fourier-domain information more robustly than with
conventional MSE-based losses. Furthermore, we enhance the perceptual loss
based on VGG by embedding KL-Divergence on extracted deep features, enabling
better structural fidelity. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks
demonstrate that LLFDisc achieves state-of-the-art performance in both
qualitative and quantitative evaluations. Our code will be released at:

Abstract: Despite the remarkable performance of supervised medical image segmentation
models, relying on a large amount of labeled data is impractical in real-world
situations. Semi-supervised learning approaches aim to alleviate this challenge
using unlabeled data through pseudo-label generation. Yet, existing
semi-supervised segmentation methods still suffer from noisy pseudo-labels and
insufficient supervision within the feature space. To solve these challenges,
this paper proposes a novel semi-supervised 3D medical image segmentation
framework based on a dual-network architecture. Specifically, we investigate a
Cross Consistency Enhancement module using both cross pseudo and
entropy-filtered supervision to reduce the noisy pseudo-labels, while we design
a dynamic weighting strategy to adjust the contributions of pseudo-labels using
an uncertainty-aware mechanism (i.e., Kullback-Leibler divergence). In
addition, we use a self-supervised contrastive learning mechanism to align
uncertain voxel features with reliable class prototypes by effectively
differentiating between trustworthy and uncertain predictions, thus reducing
prediction uncertainty. Extensive experiments are conducted on three 3D
segmentation datasets, Left Atrial, NIH Pancreas and BraTS-2019. The proposed
approach consistently exhibits superior performance across various settings
(e.g., 89.95\% Dice score on left Atrial with 10\% labeled data) compared to
the state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, the usefulness of the proposed
modules is further validated via ablation experiments.

Abstract: Quality control of assembly processes is essential in manufacturing to ensure
not only the quality of individual components but also their proper integration
into the final product. To assist in this matter, automated assembly control
using computer vision methods has been widely implemented. However, the costs
associated with image acquisition, annotation, and training of computer vision
algorithms pose challenges for integration, especially for small- and
medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), which often lack the resources for extensive
training, data collection, and manual image annotation. Synthetic data offers
the potential to reduce manual data collection and labeling. Nevertheless, its
practical application in the context of assembly quality remains limited. In
this work, we present a novel approach for easily integrable and data-efficient
visual assembly control. Our approach leverages simulated scene generation
based on computer-aided design (CAD) data and object detection algorithms. The
results demonstrate a time-saving pipeline for generating image data in
manufacturing environments, achieving a mean Average Precision (mAP@0.5:0.95)
up to 99,5% for correctly identifying instances of synthetic planetary gear
system components within our simulated training data, and up to 93% when
transferred to real-world camera-captured testing data. This research
highlights the effectiveness of synthetic data generation within an adaptable
pipeline and underscores its potential to support SMEs in implementing
resource-efficient visual assembly control solutions.

leverages their collective strengths. This approach achieved a final score of
0.96852 on the competition's private leaderboard, securing the 20th position
out of 184 teams, demonstrating the efficacy of hierarchical fusion for complex

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种弱监督和自监督的类无关运动预测方法，使用前景/背景或非地面/地面掩码替代运动标注，显著减少标注工作量，同时保持良好性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶需要理解动态环境中的运动，但获取运动标注成本高昂。室外场景通常包含移动前景和静态背景，因此可以通过场景解析来关联运动理解，减少对昂贵运动标注的依赖。

Method: 提出弱监督范式，用全标注或部分标注(1%, 0.1%)的前景/背景掩码替代运动标注；利用非地面/地面掩码进一步减少标注需求(0.01%或无标注)；设计鲁棒一致性感知Chamfer距离损失，整合多帧信息并抑制异常值。

Conclusion: 通过利用场景解析线索(前景/背景或非地面/地面分割)来指导运动预测学习，可以有效减少对昂贵运动标注的依赖，同时保持竞争性的性能表现。

Abstract: Understanding motion in dynamic environments is critical for autonomous
driving, thereby motivating research on class-agnostic motion prediction. In
this work, we investigate weakly and self-supervised class-agnostic motion
prediction from LiDAR point clouds. Outdoor scenes typically consist of mobile
foregrounds and static backgrounds, allowing motion understanding to be
associated with scene parsing. Based on this observation, we propose a novel
weakly supervised paradigm that replaces motion annotations with fully or
partially annotated (1%, 0.1%) foreground/background masks for supervision. To
this end, we develop a weakly supervised approach utilizing
foreground/background cues to guide the self-supervised learning of motion
prediction models. Since foreground motion generally occurs in non-ground
regions, non-ground/ground masks can serve as an alternative to
foreground/background masks, further reducing annotation effort. Leveraging
non-ground/ground cues, we propose two additional approaches: a weakly
supervised method requiring fewer (0.01%) foreground/background annotations,
and a self-supervised method without annotations. Furthermore, we design a
Robust Consistency-aware Chamfer Distance loss that incorporates multi-frame
information and robust penalty functions to suppress outliers in
self-supervised learning. Experiments show that our weakly and self-supervised
models outperform existing self-supervised counterparts, and our weakly
supervised models even rival some supervised ones. This demonstrates that our
approaches effectively balance annotation effort and performance.

Motivation: 现有停车位检测数据集规模有限，缺乏真实世界噪声干扰，且人工标注成本高、易出错，需要构建更大规模数据集并开发半监督方法来提升检测性能

Method: 首先构建包含多种光照、天气条件和挑战性停车位变体的大规模数据集CRPS-D；然后开发基于师生模型的半监督方法SS-PSD，采用置信度引导的掩码一致性和自适应特征扰动技术

Result: 实验结果表明SS-PSD在提出的数据集和现有数据集上都优于现有最优方法，特别是未标注数据越多，半监督方案带来的性能提升越显著

Conclusion: CRPS-D数据集是目前规模最大、停车位密度最高的数据集，SS-PSD方法首次将半监督学习引入停车位检测领域，有效提升了检测性能并降低了标注成本

Abstract: As automatic parking systems evolve, the accurate detection of parking slots
has become increasingly critical. This study focuses on parking slot detection
using surround-view cameras, which offer a comprehensive bird's-eye view of the
parking environment. However, the current datasets are limited in scale, and
the scenes they contain are seldom disrupted by real-world noise (e.g., light,
occlusion, etc.). Moreover, manual data annotation is prone to errors and
omissions due to the complexity of real-world conditions, significantly
increasing the cost of annotating large-scale datasets. To address these
issues, we first construct a large-scale parking slot detection dataset (named
CRPS-D), which includes various lighting distributions, diverse weather
conditions, and challenging parking slot variants. Compared with existing
datasets, the proposed dataset boasts the largest data scale and consists of a
higher density of parking slots, particularly featuring more slanted parking
slots. Additionally, we develop a semi-supervised baseline for parking slot
detection, termed SS-PSD, to further improve performance by exploiting
unlabeled data. To our knowledge, this is the first semi-supervised approach in
parking slot detection, which is built on the teacher-student model with
confidence-guided mask consistency and adaptive feature perturbation.
Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of SS-PSD over the existing
state-of-the-art (SoTA) solutions on both the proposed dataset and the existing
dataset. Particularly, the more unlabeled data there is, the more significant
the gains brought by our semi-supervised scheme. The relevant source codes and
the dataset have been made publicly available at

TL;DR: MSDNet是一个多阶段蒸馏框架，通过将密集LiDAR先验知识高效转移到4D雷达特征中，实现高精度点云超分辨重建和低延迟推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有4D雷达超分辨率方法存在训练成本高、推理延迟大、泛化能力差的问题，难以平衡精度和效率。

Method: 采用两阶段蒸馏：第一阶段进行重建引导的特征蒸馏，第二阶段使用扩散引导的特征蒸馏，并引入噪声适配器自适应对齐噪声水平。

Result: 在VoD和内部数据集上的实验表明，MSDNet实现了高保真重建和低延迟推理，并在下游任务中持续提升性能。

Conclusion: MSDNet框架有效解决了4D雷达点云超分辨中精度与效率的平衡问题，为自动驾驶感知提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: 4D radar super-resolution, which aims to reconstruct sparse and noisy point
clouds into dense and geometrically consistent representations, is a
foundational problem in autonomous perception. However, existing methods often
suffer from high training cost or rely on complex diffusion-based sampling,
resulting in high inference latency and poor generalization, making it
difficult to balance accuracy and efficiency. To address these limitations, we
propose MSDNet, a multi-stage distillation framework that efficiently transfers
dense LiDAR priors to 4D radar features to achieve both high reconstruction
quality and computational efficiency. The first stage performs
reconstruction-guided feature distillation, aligning and densifying the
student's features through feature reconstruction. In the second stage, we
propose diffusion-guided feature distillation, which treats the stage-one
distilled features as a noisy version of the teacher's representations and
refines them via a lightweight diffusion network. Furthermore, we introduce a
noise adapter that adaptively aligns the noise level of the feature with a
predefined diffusion timestep, enabling a more precise denoising. Extensive
experiments on the VoD and in-house datasets demonstrate that MSDNet achieves
both high-fidelity reconstruction and low-latency inference in the task of 4D
radar point cloud super-resolution, and consistently improves performance on
downstream tasks. The code will be publicly available upon publication.

Abstract: Recognizing textual attributes such as bold, italic, underline and strikeout
is essential for understanding text semantics, structure, and visual
presentation. These attributes highlight key information, making them crucial
for document analysis. Existing methods struggle with computational efficiency
or adaptability in noisy, multilingual settings. To address this, we introduce
TexTAR, a multi-task, context-aware Transformer for Textual Attribute

awareness, and our architecture employs a 2D RoPE (Rotary Positional
Embedding)-style mechanism to incorporate input context for more accurate
attribute predictions. We also introduce MMTAD, a diverse, multilingual,
multi-domain dataset annotated with text attributes across real-world documents
such as legal records, notices, and textbooks. Extensive evaluations show
TexTAR outperforms existing methods, demonstrating that contextual awareness
contributes to state-of-the-art TAR performance.

Conclusion: 该多视频协作框架通过结构化表示和图融合技术有效解决了视频时空不完整性问题，为视频语言模型的进一步发展提供了新方向

Abstract: Despite the prosperity of the video language model, the current pursuit of
comprehensive video reasoning is thwarted by the inherent spatio-temporal
incompleteness within individual videos, resulting in hallucinations and
inaccuracies. A promising solution is to augment the reasoning performance with
multiple related videos. However, video tokens are numerous and contain
redundant information, so directly feeding the relevant video data into a large
language model to enhance responses could be counterproductive. To address this
challenge, we propose a multi-video collaborative framework for video language
models. For efficient and flexible video representation, we establish a Video
Structuring Module to represent the video's knowledge as a spatio-temporal
graph. Based on the structured video representation, we design the Graph Fusion
Module to fuse the structured knowledge and valuable information from related
videos into the augmented graph node tokens. Finally, we construct an elaborate
multi-video structured prompt to integrate the graph, visual, and textual
tokens as the input to the large language model. Extensive experiments
substantiate the effectiveness of our framework, showcasing its potential as a
promising avenue for advancing video language models.

Abstract: Street trees are vital to urban livability, providing ecological and social
benefits. Establishing a detailed, accurate, and dynamically updated street
tree inventory has become essential for optimizing these multifunctional assets
within space-constrained urban environments. Given that traditional field
surveys are time-consuming and labor-intensive, automated surveys utilizing
Mobile Mapping Systems (MMS) offer a more efficient solution. However, existing
MMS-acquired tree datasets are limited by small-scale scene, limited
annotation, or single modality, restricting their utility for comprehensive
analysis. To address these limitations, we introduce WHU-STree, a cross-city,
richly annotated, and multi-modal urban street tree dataset. Collected across
two distinct cities, WHU-STree integrates synchronized point clouds and
high-resolution images, encompassing 21,007 annotated tree instances across 50
species and 2 morphological parameters. Leveraging the unique characteristics,
WHU-STree concurrently supports over 10 tasks related to street tree inventory.
We benchmark representative baselines for two key tasks--tree species
classification and individual tree segmentation. Extensive experiments and
in-depth analysis demonstrate the significant potential of multi-modal data
fusion and underscore cross-domain applicability as a critical prerequisite for
practical algorithm deployment. In particular, we identify key challenges and
outline potential future works for fully exploiting WHU-STree, encompassing
multi-modal fusion, multi-task collaboration, cross-domain generalization,
spatial pattern learning, and Multi-modal Large Language Model for street tree
asset management. The WHU-STree dataset is accessible at:

Motivation: 大型语言模型的出现为医疗对比视觉语言预训练带来了革命性机遇，但如何低成本获取大规模标注数据仍是一个挑战

Method: 使用现代LLMs自动从放射报告中提取诊断标签（AUC>96%），创建"银标准"数据集（5万CT图像-报告对仅需约3美元成本），基于此进行监督预训练和对比学习

Result: 在CT-RATE上实现83.8% AUC的零样本诊断，在RAD-ChestCT上达到77.3% AUC，跨模态检索性能显著提升（图像-图像MAP@50=53.7%，报告-图像Recall@100=52.2%）

Conclusion: LLMs能够促进更高效和可扩展的医疗AI系统，监督预训练从根本上改善了视觉语言对齐，使用简单的3D ResNet-18和标准CLIP训练即可达到最先进性能

Abstract: The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) presents unprecedented
opportunities to revolutionize medical contrastive vision-language
pre-training. In this paper, we show how LLMs can facilitate large-scale
supervised pre-training, thereby advancing vision-language alignment. We begin
by demonstrate that modern LLMs can automatically extract diagnostic labels
from radiology reports with remarkable precision (>96\% AUC in our experiments)
without complex prompt engineering, enabling the creation of large-scale
"silver-standard" datasets at a minimal cost (~\$3 for 50k CT image-report
pairs). Further, we find that vision encoder trained on this "silver-standard"
dataset achieves performance comparable to those trained on labels extracted by
specialized BERT-based models, thereby democratizing the access to large-scale
supervised pre-training. Building on this foundation, we proceed to reveal that
supervised pre-training fundamentally improves contrastive vision-language
alignment. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance using only a 3D
ResNet-18 with vanilla CLIP training, including 83.8\% AUC for zero-shot
diagnosis on CT-RATE, 77.3\% AUC on RAD-ChestCT, and substantial improvements
in cross-modal retrieval (MAP@50=53.7\% for image-image, Recall@100=52.2\% for
report-image). These results demonstrate the potential of utilizing LLMs to
facilitate {\bf more performant and scalable} medical AI systems. Our code is

Abstract: With the growing deployment of autonomous driving agents, the detection and
segmentation of road obstacles have become critical to ensure safe autonomous
navigation. However, existing road-obstacle segmentation methods are applied on
individual frames, overlooking the temporal nature of the problem, leading to
inconsistent prediction maps between consecutive frames. In this work, we
demonstrate that the road-obstacle segmentation task is inherently temporal,
since the segmentation maps for consecutive frames are strongly correlated. To
address this, we curate and adapt four evaluation benchmarks for road-obstacle
video segmentation and evaluate 11 state-of-the-art image- and video-based
segmentation methods on these benchmarks. Moreover, we introduce two strong
baseline methods based on vision foundation models. Our approach establishes a
new state-of-the-art in road-obstacle video segmentation for long-range video

Result: 实验表明End4能有效泛化到未见过的掩码模式，并在各种扰动下保持鲁棒性

Conclusion: End4方法在检测扩散修复生成图像方面表现优异，具有良好的泛化能力和鲁棒性

Abstract: The powerful generative capabilities of diffusion models have significantly
advanced the field of image synthesis, enhancing both full image generation and
inpainting-based image editing. Despite their remarkable advancements,
diffusion models also raise concerns about potential misuse for malicious
purposes. However, existing approaches struggle to identify images generated by
diffusion-based inpainting models, even when similar inpainted images are
included in their training data. To address this challenge, we propose a novel
detection method based on End-to-end denoising diffusion (End4). Specifically,
End4 designs a denoising reconstruction model to improve the alignment degree
between the latent spaces of the reconstruction and detection processes, thus
reconstructing features that are more conducive to detection. Meanwhile, it
leverages a Scale-aware Pyramid-like Fusion Module (SPFM) that refines local
image features under the guidance of attention pyramid layers at different
scales, enhancing feature discriminability. Additionally, to evaluate detection
performance on inpainted images, we establish a comprehensive benchmark
comprising images generated from five distinct masked regions. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our End4 effectively generalizes to unseen masking
patterns and remains robust under various perturbations. Our code and dataset

### [104] [Curriculum Multi-Task Self-Supervision Improves Lightweight Architectures for Onboard Satellite Hyperspectral Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13229)
*Hugo Carlesso,Josiane Mothe,Radu Tudor Ionescu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的课程多任务自监督学习框架(CMTSSL)，用于高光谱图像的轻量级分析，通过掩码图像建模和空间光谱拼图解决，在超轻量架构上实现优异的下游分割性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高光谱成像数据维度高且卫星数据传输速率慢，需要紧凑高效的模型支持星上处理，减少冗余或低价值数据的传输

Method: 整合掩码图像建模与解耦的空间和光谱拼图解决，采用课程学习策略逐步增加数据复杂度，使编码器能够联合捕获细粒度光谱连续性、空间结构和全局语义特征

Result: 在四个公共基准数据集上验证，使用比最先进模型轻16,000倍以上的架构，在下游分割任务中 consistently 获得性能提升

Conclusion: CMTSSL在轻量级架构的通用表示学习方面具有巨大潜力，特别适合星上卫星部署的实际高光谱应用

Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) captures detailed spectral signatures across
hundreds of contiguous bands per pixel, being indispensable for remote sensing
applications such as land-cover classification, change detection, and
environmental monitoring. Due to the high dimensionality of HSI data and the
slow rate of data transfer in satellite-based systems, compact and efficient
models are required to support onboard processing and minimize the transmission
of redundant or low-value data, e.g. cloud-covered areas. To this end, we
introduce a novel curriculum multi-task self-supervised learning (CMTSSL)
framework designed for lightweight architectures for HSI analysis. CMTSSL
integrates masked image modeling with decoupled spatial and spectral jigsaw
puzzle solving, guided by a curriculum learning strategy that progressively
increases data complexity during self-supervision. This enables the encoder to
jointly capture fine-grained spectral continuity, spatial structure, and global
semantic features. Unlike prior dual-task SSL methods, CMTSSL simultaneously
addresses spatial and spectral reasoning within a unified and computationally
efficient design, being particularly suitable for training lightweight models
for onboard satellite deployment. We validate our approach on four public
benchmark datasets, demonstrating consistent gains in downstream segmentation
tasks, using architectures that are over 16,000x lighter than some
state-of-the-art models. These results highlight the potential of CMTSSL in
generalizable representation learning with lightweight architectures for
real-world HSI applications. Our code is publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 真空热成型过程中材料性能和模具配置的变化导致质量一致性难以保证，需要开发一种能够预测和优化工艺参数的质量控制系统

Method: 使用真空成型样本的视觉数据构建数据集，采用图像增强技术改进模型训练，应用k近邻算法将低质量零件映射到高质量对应物以识别工艺参数调整需求

Result: 模型在调整加热功率、加热时间和真空时间方面表现出色，有效减少缺陷并提高生产效率

Conclusion: 该视觉质量控制系统能够以最少的数据需求显著提升真空热成型零件的质量一致性

Abstract: Ensuring consistent quality in vacuum thermoforming presents challenges due
to variations in material properties and tooling configurations. This research
introduces a vision-based quality control system to predict and optimise
process parameters, thereby enhancing part quality with minimal data
requirements. A comprehensive dataset was developed using visual data from
vacuum-formed samples subjected to various process parameters, supplemented by
image augmentation techniques to improve model training. A k-Nearest Neighbour
algorithm was subsequently employed to identify adjustments needed in process
parameters by mapping low-quality parts to their high-quality counterparts. The
model exhibited strong performance in adjusting heating power, heating time,
and vacuum time to reduce defects and improve production efficiency.

TL;DR: RadGame是一个AI驱动的游戏化放射学教育平台，通过定位异常和生成报告两个核心游戏模块，结合大规模公共数据集和AI自动反馈，显著提升放射学学习效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统放射学培训主要依赖被动案例学习或需要放射科医师实时指导，缺乏即时、可扩展的反馈机制。RadGame旨在通过AI驱动的游戏化平台解决这一局限性。

Method: 平台包含两个核心模块：RadGame Localize（玩家绘制异常边界框，与放射科医师标注对比，视觉语言模型生成错漏解释）和RadGame Report（玩家撰写报告，基于放射学报告生成指标提供结构化AI反馈）。

Result: 前瞻性评估显示，使用RadGame的参与者在定位准确率上提升68%（传统方法仅17%），报告撰写准确率提升31%（传统方法仅4%）。

Conclusion: RadGame展示了AI驱动游戏化在提供可扩展、反馈丰富的放射学培训方面的潜力，重新构想了医疗AI资源在教育中的应用方式。

Abstract: We introduce RadGame, an AI-powered gamified platform for radiology education
that targets two core skills: localizing findings and generating reports.
Traditional radiology training is based on passive exposure to cases or active
practice with real-time input from supervising radiologists, limiting
opportunities for immediate and scalable feedback. RadGame addresses this gap
by combining gamification with large-scale public datasets and automated,
AI-driven feedback that provides clear, structured guidance to human learners.
In RadGame Localize, players draw bounding boxes around abnormalities, which
are automatically compared to radiologist-drawn annotations from public
datasets, and visual explanations are generated by vision-language models for
user missed findings. In RadGame Report, players compose findings given a chest
X-ray, patient age and indication, and receive structured AI feedback based on
radiology report generation metrics, highlighting errors and omissions compared
to a radiologist's written ground truth report from public datasets, producing
a final performance and style score. In a prospective evaluation, participants
using RadGame achieved a 68% improvement in localization accuracy compared to
17% with traditional passive methods and a 31% improvement in report-writing
accuracy compared to 4% with traditional methods after seeing the same cases.
RadGame highlights the potential of AI-driven gamification to deliver scalable,
feedback-rich radiology training and reimagines the application of medical AI
resources in education.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 需要可靠的方法来量化AI生成图像的感知真实度并识别视觉不一致区域，这对于AI生成图像的实际应用和通过真实度反馈改进生成AI的光照真实感至关重要

Method: 使用在大规模数据集上训练的视觉语言模型生成视觉不一致的文本描述，作为人类标注的可靠替代，实现整体客观真实度评估和局部不一致性识别

Result: 多模态方法提高了客观真实度预测性能，并生成能够有效区分真实和不真实空间区域的密集真实度图

Conclusion: 该框架成功实现了对AI生成图像的整体真实度评估和局部不一致性识别，为生成AI的改进提供了有效的真实度反馈机制

Abstract: A reliable method of quantifying the perceptual realness of AI-generated
images and identifying visually inconsistent regions is crucial for practical
use of AI-generated images and for improving photorealism of generative AI via
realness feedback during training. This paper introduces a framework that
accomplishes both overall objective realness assessment and local inconsistency
identification of AI-generated images using textual descriptions of visual
inconsistencies generated by vision-language models trained on large datasets
that serve as reliable substitutes for human annotations. Our results
demonstrate that the proposed multimodal approach improves objective realness
prediction performance and produces dense realness maps that effectively
distinguish between realistic and unrealistic spatial regions.

*Zefan Qu,Zhenwei Wang,Haoyuan Wang,Ke Xu,Gerhard Hancke,Rynson W. H. Lau*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: StyleSculptor是一个无需训练的零样本方法，通过内容图像和风格图像生成风格可控的3D资产，使用Style Disentangled Attention模块实现细粒度的纹理和几何风格控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在视频游戏和虚拟现实等应用中，需要创建与现有资产风格一致的3D资产，但现有的3D生成方法难以实现精确的风格控制。

Method: 提出Style Disentangled Attention模块，通过跨3D注意力机制实现内容图像和风格图像的动态交互，并引入风格解耦特征选择策略来分离风格和内容特征。

Result: 实验表明StyleSculptor在生成高保真3D资产方面优于现有基线方法，能够实现纹理、几何或两者的精确风格控制。

Conclusion: 该方法为零样本风格引导的3D生成提供了有效解决方案，实现了细粒度的风格控制和可调节的风格强度。

Abstract: Creating 3D assets that follow the texture and geometry style of existing
ones is often desirable or even inevitable in practical applications like video
gaming and virtual reality. While impressive progress has been made in
generating 3D objects from text or images, creating style-controllable 3D
assets remains a complex and challenging problem. In this work, we propose
StyleSculptor, a novel training-free approach for generating style-guided 3D
assets from a content image and one or more style images. Unlike previous
works, StyleSculptor achieves style-guided 3D generation in a zero-shot manner,
enabling fine-grained 3D style control that captures the texture, geometry, or
both styles of user-provided style images. At the core of StyleSculptor is a
novel Style Disentangled Attention (SD-Attn) module, which establishes a
dynamic interaction between the input content image and style image for
style-guided 3D asset generation via a cross-3D attention mechanism, enabling
stable feature fusion and effective style-guided generation. To alleviate
semantic content leakage, we also introduce a style-disentangled feature
selection strategy within the SD-Attn module, which leverages the variance of
3D feature patches to disentangle style- and content-significant channels,
allowing selective feature injection within the attention framework. With
SD-Attn, the network can dynamically compute texture-, geometry-, or
both-guided features to steer the 3D generation process. Built upon this, we
further propose the Style Guided Control (SGC) mechanism, which enables
exclusive geometry- or texture-only stylization, as well as adjustable style
intensity control. Extensive experiments demonstrate that StyleSculptor
outperforms existing baseline methods in producing high-fidelity 3D assets.

TL;DR: SR-3D是一个连接单视图2D图像和多视图3D数据的视觉语言模型，通过共享视觉标记空间实现灵活的区域提示和空间推理


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决传统方法需要多帧标注的繁琐问题，以及实现2D和3D表示空间的统一，提升场景理解能力

Method: 通过用3D位置嵌入丰富2D视觉特征，使3D模型能够利用强大的2D先验进行跨帧空间推理，支持边界框、分割掩码或直接3D标注

Result: 在通用2D视觉语言和专用3D空间基准测试中达到最先进性能，能够准确推断空间关系和度量测量

Conclusion: SR-3D有效统一了2D和3D表示空间，在无传感器3D输入或真实3D标注的野外视频中也表现出良好适用性

Abstract: We present Spatial Region 3D (SR-3D) aware vision-language model that
connects single-view 2D images and multi-view 3D data through a shared visual
token space. SR-3D supports flexible region prompting, allowing users to
annotate regions with bounding boxes, segmentation masks on any frame, or
directly in 3D, without the need for exhaustive multi-frame labeling. We
achieve this by enriching 2D visual features with 3D positional embeddings,
which allows the 3D model to draw upon strong 2D priors for more accurate
spatial reasoning across frames, even when objects of interest do not co-occur
within the same view. Extensive experiments on both general 2D vision language
and specialized 3D spatial benchmarks demonstrate that SR-3D achieves
state-of-the-art performance, underscoring its effectiveness for unifying 2D
and 3D representation space on scene understanding. Moreover, we observe
applicability to in-the-wild videos without sensory 3D inputs or ground-truth
3D annotations, where SR-3D accurately infers spatial relationships and metric
measurements.

Abstract: Recently, embedding resources, including models, benchmarks, and datasets,
have been widely released to support a variety of languages. However, the Dutch
language remains underrepresented, typically comprising only a small fraction
of the published multilingual resources. To address this gap and encourage the
further development of Dutch embeddings, we introduce new resources for their
evaluation and generation. First, we introduce the Massive Text Embedding
Benchmark for Dutch (MTEB-NL), which includes both existing Dutch datasets and
newly created ones, covering a wide range of tasks. Second, we provide a
training dataset compiled from available Dutch retrieval datasets, complemented
with synthetic data generated by large language models to expand task coverage
beyond retrieval. Finally, we release a series of E5-NL models compact yet
efficient embedding models that demonstrate strong performance across multiple
tasks. We make our resources publicly available through the Hugging Face Hub
and the MTEB package.

*Fuyu Xing,Zimu Wang,Wei Wang,Haiyang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文首次系统评估了DeepSeek-VL2和Qwen-VL系列等大型视觉语言模型在多媒体事件抽取任务上的表现，发现few-shot模式下视觉任务表现更好但文本任务困难，LoRA微调显著提升性能，多模态组合展现强协同效应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多媒体内容的激增需要有效的多媒体事件抽取系统，虽然大型视觉语言模型展现出强大的跨模态能力，但它们在M2E2任务中的应用价值尚未得到充分探索。

Method: 在M2E2数据集上系统评估代表性LVLMs，涵盖纯文本、纯图像和跨媒体子任务，在few-shot提示和微调两种设置下进行评估，使用LoRA进行微调，并进行详细的错误分析。

Result: few-shot LVLMs在视觉任务上表现更好但在文本任务上困难；LoRA微调显著提升模型性能；LVLMs在多模态组合中展现出强协同效应，在跨模态设置中获得优异性能。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LVLMs在M2E2任务中的潜力和局限性，指出了语义精确性、定位和跨模态基础等持续挑战，这些仍是推进M2E2能力的关键障碍。

Abstract: The proliferation of multimedia content necessitates the development of
effective Multimedia Event Extraction (M2E2) systems. Though Large
Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have shown strong cross-modal capabilities,
their utility in the M2E2 task remains underexplored. In this paper, we present
the first systematic evaluation of representative LVLMs, including DeepSeek-VL2
and the Qwen-VL series, on the M2E2 dataset. Our evaluations cover text-only,
image-only, and cross-media subtasks, assessed under both few-shot prompting
and fine-tuning settings. Our key findings highlight the following valuable
insights: (1) Few-shot LVLMs perform notably better on visual tasks but
struggle significantly with textual tasks; (2) Fine-tuning LVLMs with LoRA
substantially enhances model performance; and (3) LVLMs exhibit strong synergy
when combining modalities, achieving superior performance in cross-modal
settings. We further provide a detailed error analysis to reveal persistent
challenges in areas such as semantic precision, localization, and cross-modal
grounding, which remain critical obstacles for advancing M2E2 capabilities.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MORABLES是一个基于寓言和短篇故事的人类验证基准，用于评估LLM的道德推理能力，发现大型模型虽然表现更好但容易受到对抗性攻击，存在显著的自相矛盾问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM在标准阅读理解基准上的优异表现，需要评估它们在复杂抽象推理和推理能力方面的表现，特别是道德推理等深层理解技能。

Method: 构建MORABLES基准，包含从历史文学中提取的寓言和短篇故事，采用多项选择题形式针对道德推理，并设计对抗性变体来测试模型鲁棒性。

Result: 大型模型表现优于小型模型，但对对抗性操作敏感，经常依赖表面模式而非真正的道德推理，最佳模型在约20%的情况下会自相矛盾。推理增强模型未能缩小差距。

Conclusion: 规模而非推理能力是性能的主要驱动因素，LLM在道德推理方面存在脆弱性，容易受到提示框架的影响而产生自相矛盾。

Abstract: As LLMs excel on standard reading comprehension benchmarks, attention is
shifting toward evaluating their capacity for complex abstract reasoning and
inference. Literature-based benchmarks, with their rich narrative and moral
depth, provide a compelling framework for evaluating such deeper comprehension
skills. Here, we present MORABLES, a human-verified benchmark built from fables
and short stories drawn from historical literature. The main task is structured
as multiple-choice questions targeting moral inference, with carefully crafted
distractors that challenge models to go beyond shallow, extractive question
answering. To further stress-test model robustness, we introduce adversarial
variants designed to surface LLM vulnerabilities and shortcuts due to issues
such as data contamination. Our findings show that, while larger models
outperform smaller ones, they remain susceptible to adversarial manipulation
and often rely on superficial patterns rather than true moral reasoning. This
brittleness results in significant self-contradiction, with the best models
refuting their own answers in roughly 20% of cases depending on the framing of
the moral choice. Interestingly, reasoning-enhanced models fail to bridge this
gap, suggesting that scale - not reasoning ability - is the primary driver of
performance.

TL;DR: 本文研究使用LLM作为评估者来评估法律领域的检索增强生成系统，发现传统评估指标在AI系统评估中可能误导，提出Gwet's AC2和秩相关系数作为更可靠的评估指标，以及Wilcoxon符号秩检验进行系统比较。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着生成式AI的兴起，传统评估指标无法捕捉法律研究等专业领域的细微质量维度，需要研究LLM是否能够作为可靠的评估者来评估同类系统。

Method: 通过系统性实验，研究不同评估者间可靠性指标在LLM与人类评估对齐中的表现，使用Gwet's AC2、秩相关系数等指标进行法官选择，采用Wilcoxon符号秩检验和Benjamini-Hochberg校正进行统计系统比较。

Result: 发现传统一致性指标如Krippendorff's alpha在AI系统评估的偏态分布中可能产生误导，Gwet's AC2和秩相关系数更适合作为评估指标选择依据。

Conclusion: 提出了一种可扩展、成本效益高的评估方法，能够满足法律应用所需的精确度，将人力密集型瓶颈转变为自动化且统计原理严谨的评估框架。

Abstract: The evaluation bottleneck in recommendation systems has become particularly
acute with the rise of Generative AI, where traditional metrics fall short of
capturing nuanced quality dimensions that matter in specialized domains like
legal research. Can we trust Large Language Models to serve as reliable judges
of their own kind? This paper investigates LLM-as-a-Judge as a principled
approach to evaluating Retrieval-Augmented Generation systems in legal
contexts, where the stakes of recommendation quality are exceptionally high.
  We tackle two fundamental questions that determine practical viability: which
inter-rater reliability metrics best capture the alignment between LLM and
human assessments, and how do we conduct statistically sound comparisons
between competing systems? Through systematic experimentation, we discover that
traditional agreement metrics like Krippendorff's alpha can be misleading in
the skewed distributions typical of AI system evaluations. Instead, Gwet's AC2
and rank correlation coefficients emerge as more robust indicators for judge
selection, while the Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test with Benjamini-Hochberg
corrections provides the statistical rigor needed for reliable system
comparisons.
  Our findings suggest a path toward scalable, cost-effective evaluation that
maintains the precision demanded by legal applications, transforming what was
once a human-intensive bottleneck into an automated, yet statistically
principled, evaluation framework.

Abstract: LLMs are becoming increasingly capable and widespread. Consequently, the
potential and reality of their misuse is also growing. In this work, we address
the problem of detecting LLM-generated text that is not explicitly declared as
such. We present a novel, general-purpose, and supervised LLM text detector,
SElected-Next-Token tRAnsformer (SENTRA). SENTRA is a Transformer-based encoder
leveraging selected-next-token-probability sequences and utilizing contrastive
pre-training on large amounts of unlabeled data. Our experiments on three
popular public datasets across 24 domains of text demonstrate SENTRA is a
general-purpose classifier that significantly outperforms popular baselines in

Motivation: 医学领域的自然语言生成评估面临独特挑战，传统自动评估指标在区分高质量输出方面存在不足，特别是在开放式医学问答任务中

Method: 构建MORQA多语言基准，包含英语和中文的医学视觉和文本问答数据集，每个问题有2-4+个医学专家编写的参考答案和专家人工评分，对比传统指标和基于LLM的评估器

Result: 基于LLM的方法（如GPT-4和Gemini）在相关性方面显著优于传统指标，对语义细微差别敏感且对参考答案变异性具有鲁棒性

Conclusion: 研究提供了医学领域NLG评估的首个全面多语言定性研究，强调需要与人类判断对齐的评估方法，所有数据集和标注将公开发布

Abstract: Evaluating natural language generation (NLG) systems in the medical domain
presents unique challenges due to the critical demands for accuracy, relevance,
and domain-specific expertise. Traditional automatic evaluation metrics, such
as BLEU, ROUGE, and BERTScore, often fall short in distinguishing between
high-quality outputs, especially given the open-ended nature of medical
question answering (QA) tasks where multiple valid responses may exist. In this
work, we introduce MORQA (Medical Open-Response QA), a new multilingual
benchmark designed to assess the effectiveness of NLG evaluation metrics across
three medical visual and text-based QA datasets in English and Chinese. Unlike
prior resources, our datasets feature 2-4+ gold-standard answers authored by
medical professionals, along with expert human ratings for three English and
Chinese subsets. We benchmark both traditional metrics and large language model
(LLM)-based evaluators, such as GPT-4 and Gemini, finding that LLM-based
approaches significantly outperform traditional metrics in correlating with
expert judgments. We further analyze factors driving this improvement,
including LLMs' sensitivity to semantic nuances and robustness to variability
among reference answers. Our results provide the first comprehensive,
multilingual qualitative study of NLG evaluation in the medical domain,
highlighting the need for human-aligned evaluation methods. All datasets and
annotations will be publicly released to support future research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医疗领域基准测试数据范围狭窄，无法捕捉真实世界医疗信息的复杂性，需要更全面的评估体系来确保LLM在医疗应用中的事实可靠性。

Method: 采用混合AI-人类框架构建基准，通过迭代专家反馈优化AI驱动的多标准筛选过程，确保数据质量和难度。对20个领先LLM进行真实性分类和错误定位的全面评估。

Result: 模型在判断文本是否包含错误方面表现尚可，但在精确定位错误方面远低于人类专家水平。发现模型存在过度批评现象，即错误地将正确信息标记为错误，这种现象在使用多智能体协作和推理时扩展等高级技术时更加严重。

Conclusion: MedFact为开发更可靠、具有医学意识的模型提供了强大资源，突显了在医疗应用中部署LLM面临的关键挑战，特别是错误精确定位和过度批评问题。

Abstract: The increasing deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) in healthcare
necessitates a rigorous evaluation of their factual reliability. However,
existing benchmarks are often limited by narrow domains of data, failing to
capture the complexity of real-world medical information. To address this
critical gap, we introduce MedFact, a new and challenging benchmark for Chinese
medical fact-checking. MedFact comprises 2,116 expert-annotated instances
curated from diverse real-world texts, spanning 13 medical specialties, 8
fine-grained error types, 4 writing styles, and multiple difficulty levels. Its
construction employs a hybrid AI-human framework where iterative expert
feedback refines an AI-driven, multi-criteria filtering process, ensuring both
high data quality and difficulty. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 20
leading LLMs, benchmarking their performance on veracity classification and
error localization against a human expert baseline. Our results reveal that
while models can often determine if a text contains an error, precisely
localizing it remains a substantial challenge, with even top-performing models
falling short of human performance. Furthermore, our analysis uncovers a
frequent ``over-criticism'' phenomenon, a tendency for models to misidentify
correct information as erroneous, which is exacerbated by advanced reasoning
techniques such as multi-agent collaboration and inference-time scaling. By
highlighting these critical challenges for deploying LLMs in medical
applications, MedFact provides a robust resource to drive the development of
more factually reliable and medically aware models.

Motivation: 现有的上下文学习方法通常仅基于嵌入相似度或生成概率来检索演示示例，这往往导致选择不相关或冗余的示例，无法全面覆盖测试输入所需的细粒度知识需求。

Method: 提出TopicK框架：1）估计输入所需的主题知识；2）评估模型在这些主题上的知识水平；3）迭代选择能够引入模型知识盲区且未被覆盖的必需主题的演示示例。

Result: 在多个数据集和开源/闭源大语言模型上的广泛实验验证了TopicK的有效性，显著提升了上下文学习的性能。

Conclusion: TopicK通过主题覆盖的方法有效解决了传统检索方法中存在的相关性和冗余性问题，为上下文学习提供了更全面和针对性的演示选择策略。

Abstract: The effectiveness of in-context learning relies heavily on selecting
demonstrations that provide all the necessary information for a given test
input. To achieve this, it is crucial to identify and cover fine-grained
knowledge requirements. However, prior methods often retrieve demonstrations
based solely on embedding similarity or generation probability, resulting in
irrelevant or redundant examples. In this paper, we propose TopicK, a topic
coverage-based retrieval framework that selects demonstrations to
comprehensively cover topic-level knowledge relevant to both the test input and
the model. Specifically, TopicK estimates the topics required by the input and
assesses the model's knowledge on those topics. TopicK then iteratively selects
demonstrations that introduce previously uncovered required topics, in which
the model exhibits low topical knowledge. We validate the effectiveness of
TopicK through extensive experiments across various datasets and both open- and
closed-source LLMs. Our source code is available at

Abstract: The automated generation of research workflows is essential for improving the
reproducibility of research and accelerating the paradigm of "AI for Science".
However, existing methods typically extract merely fragmented procedural
components and thus fail to capture complete research workflows. To address
this gap, we propose an end-to-end framework that generates comprehensive,
structured research workflows by mining full-text academic papers. As a case
study in the Natural Language Processing (NLP) domain, our paragraph-centric
approach first employs Positive-Unlabeled (PU) Learning with SciBERT to
identify workflow-descriptive paragraphs, achieving an F1-score of 0.9772.
Subsequently, we utilize Flan-T5 with prompt learning to generate workflow
phrases from these paragraphs, yielding ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2, and ROUGE-L scores of
0.4543, 0.2877, and 0.4427, respectively. These phrases are then systematically
categorized into data preparation, data processing, and data analysis stages
using ChatGPT with few-shot learning, achieving a classification precision of
0.958. By mapping categorized phrases to their document locations in the
documents, we finally generate readable visual flowcharts of the entire
research workflows. This approach facilitates the analysis of workflows derived
from an NLP corpus and reveals key methodological shifts over the past two
decades, including the increasing emphasis on data analysis and the transition
from feature engineering to ablation studies. Our work offers a validated
technical framework for automated workflow generation, along with a novel,
process-oriented perspective for the empirical investigation of evolving
scientific paradigms. Source code and data are available at:

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 评估SOTA语言模型在英语和孟加拉语中处理时态、否定、语态等精细语言现象的能力，发现Compound-Beta模型在跨语言场景中与人类判断最一致


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着语言模型在教育技术中的广泛应用，需要确保其与人类语言理解的一致性，特别是在联合国可持续发展目标4要求语言清晰度的背景下

Method: 引入RECISE评估指南和LUCID数据集，使用皮尔逊相关系数、斯皮尔曼相关系数、平均绝对误差和新型HCE准确率等指标评估多个SOTA模型

Result: Compound-Beta表现最均衡，在英语中皮尔逊相关系数最高，在混合语言数据上表现稳健，与人类判断高度一致

Conclusion: 语言模型在精细语言现象处理上仍需改进，Compound-Beta在跨语言对齐方面表现最佳，为教育技术应用提供了重要参考

Abstract: Despite advances in natural language generation and understanding, LM still
struggle with fine grained linguistic phenomena such as tense, negation, voice,
and modality which are the elements central to effective human communication.
In the context of the United Nations SDG 4, where linguistic clarity is
critical, the deployment of LMs in educational technologies demands careful
scrutiny. As LMs are increasingly powering applications like tutoring systems,
automated grading, and translation, their alignment with human linguistic
interpretation becomes essential for effective learning. In this study, we
conduct a evaluation of SOTA language models across these challenging contexts
in both English and Bengali. To ensure a structured assessment, we introduce a
new Route for Evaluation of Cognitive Inference in Systematic Environments
guidelines. Our proposed LUCID dataset, composed of carefully crafted sentence
pairs in English and Bengali, specifically challenges these models on critical
aspects of language comprehension, including negation, tense, voice variations.
We assess the performance of SOTA models including MISTRAL-SABA-24B,
LLaMA-4-Scout-17B, LLaMA-3.3-70B, Gemma2-9B, and Compound-Beta using standard
metrics like Pearson correlation, Spearman correlation, and Mean Absolute
Error, as well as novel, linguistically inspired metric the HCE accuracy. The
HCE accuracy measures how often model predictions fall within one standard
deviation of the mean human rating, thus capturing human like tolerance for
variability in language interpretation. Our findings highlight Compound-Beta as
the most balanced model, consistently achieving high correlations and low MAEs
across diverse language conditions. It records the highest Pearson correlation
in English and demonstrates robust performance on mixed-language data,
indicating a strong alignment with human judgments in cross lingual scenarios.

TL;DR: R2tA方法通过提炼LLM的推理轨迹来训练任务专用推理模型，解决了高质量标签稀缺的问题，在数据库设计评估任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当直接人工监督或高质量标签稀缺时，训练任务专用的小型推理模型具有挑战性。但具备推理能力的大语言模型能产生丰富的中间推理轨迹，可以系统性地提炼为有效的监督信号。

Method: 提出Reason-Refine-then-Align (R2tA)方法：1）从开源基础模型生成初始推理和响应；2）提炼这些轨迹，修复幻觉和不一致性，形成高质量数据集；3）进行两阶段对齐：监督微调(SFT)和直接偏好优化(DPO)，校准模型的中间推理。

Result: 在扩展实体关系图(EERD)评估任务中，使用包含600个变体（450训练/150测试）的数据集进行实证评估，涵盖11个错误类别。R2tA方法在结构复杂任务中表现优异，而仅提示方法会遗漏或产生幻觉错误。

Conclusion: R2tA为数据稀缺领域的大语言模型适应提供了实用、经济高效的路径，能够为教育等领域开发可复现的AI工具。

Abstract: Training a task-specific small reasoning model is challenging when direct
human supervision or high-quality labels are scarce. However, LLMs with
reasoning capabilities produce abundant intermediate reasoning traces that can
be systematically refined to create effective supervision signals. We propose
Reason-Refine-then-Align (R2tA), which turns refined model rationales into
supervision for training task-specific reasoning models. Our method generates
initial reasoning and responses from an open-source base model on task-specific
inputs, then refines these traces, fixing hallucinations and inconsistencies,
to form a high-fidelity dataset. We perform a two-stage alignment, supervised
fine-tuning (SFT), followed by direct preference optimization (DPO) to
calibrate the model's intermediate reasoning with human-validated conceptual
preferences and then condition the final output on that aligned reasoning. As a
case study, we apply R2tA to evaluate extended entity relationship diagrams
(EERDs) in database system design, a structurally complex task where
prompt-only methods miss or hallucinate errors. We curated a dataset of 600
EERD variants (train/test split of 450/150, respectively) with induced mistakes
spanning 11 categories. Empirical evaluation suggests R2tA provides a
practical, cost-effective path to scalable LLM adaptation in data-scarce
domains, enabling reproducible AI tools for education and beyond.

Conclusion: 该研究展示了生产导向的优化对于基于LLM的ASR系统在实际应用中的重要性，FunAudio-ASR系统能够有效解决LLM幻觉问题并在复杂语音识别场景中表现优异。

Abstract: In recent years, automatic speech recognition (ASR) has witnessed
transformative advancements driven by three complementary paradigms: data
scaling, model size scaling, and deep integration with large language models
(LLMs). However, LLMs are prone to hallucination, which can significantly
degrade user experience in real-world ASR applications. In this paper, we
present FunAudio-ASR, a large-scale, LLM-based ASR system that synergistically
combines massive data, large model capacity, LLM integration, and reinforcement
learning to achieve state-of-the-art performance across diverse and complex
speech recognition scenarios. Moreover, FunAudio-ASR is specifically optimized
for practical deployment, with enhancements in streaming capability, noise
robustness, code-switching, hotword customization, and satisfying other
real-world application requirements. Experimental results show that while most
LLM-based ASR systems achieve strong performance on open-source benchmarks,
they often underperform on real industry evaluation sets. Thanks to
production-oriented optimizations, FunAudio-ASR achieves SOTA performance on
real application datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness and robustness in
practical settings.

*Chiara Bonfanti,Michele Colombino,Giulia Coucourde,Faeze Memari,Stefano Pinardi,Rosa Meo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究比较了三种训练Transformer神经网络的流程，用于开发班巴拉语（非洲曼德语系）机器翻译系统。简单Transformer模型在翻译准确率上表现最佳，而基于LLaMA3的指导模型在单一数据集上表现更好，说明它们能更有效地捕捉数据集特定模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 班巴拉语是一种拥有约1418万使用者的非洲语言，但缺乏高质量的机器翻译资源。本研究旨在探索不同神经网络架构在低资源语言翻译中的表现，为班巴拉语提供可行的机器翻译解决方案。

Method: 1. 简单Transformer模型进行法语到班巴拉语翻译；2. 基于LLaMA3（3B-8B）指导模型的解码器架构微调；3. 使用师生双重神经网络的语言蒸馏方法，将班巴拉语集成到预训练的LaBSE模型中，再通过BERT扩展生成翻译。所有模型在不同超参数组合下训练，使用BLEU和chrF指标评估。

Result: 简单Transformer模型表现最佳：在Bayelemagaba数据集上达到10% BLEU和21% chrF，在Yiri数据集上达到33.81% BLEU和41% chrF。指导模型在单一数据集上表现优于聚合数据集，表明它们能更好地捕捉数据集特定模式。

Conclusion: 对于班巴拉语这样的低资源语言，简单的Transformer架构在机器翻译任务中表现最优，而大型指导模型虽然在某些特定数据集上表现良好，但在泛化能力上不如简单模型。这为低资源语言机器翻译提供了实用的架构选择指导。

Abstract: This work compares three pipelines for training transformer-based neural
networks to produce machine translators for Bambara, a Mand\`e language spoken
in Africa by about 14,188,850 people. The first pipeline trains a simple
transformer to translate sentences from French into Bambara. The second
fine-tunes LLaMA3 (3B-8B) instructor models using decoder-only architectures
for French-to-Bambara translation. Models from the first two pipelines were
trained with different hyperparameter combinations to improve BLEU and chrF
scores, evaluated on both test sentences and official Bambara benchmarks. The
third pipeline uses language distillation with a student-teacher dual neural
network to integrate Bambara into a pre-trained LaBSE model, which provides
language-agnostic embeddings. A BERT extension is then applied to LaBSE to
generate translations. All pipelines were tested on Dokotoro (medical) and
Bayelemagaba (mixed domains). Results show that the first pipeline, although
simpler, achieves the best translation accuracy (10% BLEU, 21% chrF on
Bayelemagaba), consistent with low-resource translation results. On the Yiri
dataset, created for this work, it achieves 33.81% BLEU and 41% chrF.
Instructor-based models perform better on single datasets than on aggregated
collections, suggesting they capture dataset-specific patterns more
effectively.

TL;DR: 提出了一种零样本自动音频字幕生成系统，利用预训练模型避免大量训练，通过音频CLIP模型提取特征并生成结构化提示来指导LLM生成字幕，相比传统方法在NLG平均得分上提升35%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动音频字幕生成面临数据集有限的问题，相比图像字幕数据量不足，需要寻找不依赖大量训练数据的解决方案

Method: 使用预训练音频CLIP模型提取听觉特征并生成结构化提示，指导大型语言模型生成字幕，通过音频CLIP模型优化token选择确保与音频内容对齐

Result: 实验结果显示使用MAGIC搜索和WavCaps模型时，NLG平均得分从4.7提升到7.3（35%提升），性能受音频-文本匹配模型和关键词选择影响显著

Conclusion: 零样本方法在自动音频字幕生成中表现优异，单关键词提示效果最佳，无关键词列表时性能下降50%，证明了预训练模型在此任务中的有效性

Abstract: Automated Audio Captioning (AAC) generates captions for audio clips but faces
challenges due to limited datasets compared to image captioning. To overcome
this, we propose the zero-shot AAC system that leverages pre-trained models,
eliminating the need for extensive training. Our approach uses a pre-trained
audio CLIP model to extract auditory features and generate a structured prompt,
which guides a Large Language Model (LLM) in caption generation. Unlike
traditional greedy decoding, our method refines token selection through the
audio CLIP model, ensuring alignment with the audio content. Experimental
results demonstrate a 35% improvement in NLG mean score (from 4.7 to 7.3) using
MAGIC search with the WavCaps model. The performance is heavily influenced by
the audio-text matching model and keyword selection, with optimal results
achieved using a single keyword prompt, and a 50% performance drop when no
keyword list is used.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出EconProver方法，通过动态CoT切换机制和多样化并行强化学习，在自动定理证明任务中仅用12%的计算成本就能达到基线方法的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型语言模型在自动定理证明中采用测试时扩展策略（如反射式CoT推理和增加采样次数）虽然性能显著，但带来了巨大的计算开销。现有成本分析通常只关注采样次数，而忽略了不同扩展策略带来的采样成本差异。

Method: 提出了两种互补方法：1）动态CoT切换机制，减少不必要的token消耗；2）多样化并行强化学习与可训练前缀，在有限采样次数下提高通过率。这两种方法可以集成到统一的EconRL管道中。

Result: 在miniF2F和ProofNet数据集上的实验表明，EconProver仅用基线方法12%的计算成本就达到了可比的性能。

Conclusion: 这项工作为部署轻量级自动定理证明模型提供了可行的见解，在不牺牲性能的前提下显著降低了计算成本。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently advanced the field of Automated
Theorem Proving (ATP), attaining substantial performance gains through widely
adopted test-time scaling strategies, notably reflective Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
reasoning and increased sampling passes. However, they both introduce
significant computational overhead for inference. Moreover, existing cost
analyses typically regulate only the number of sampling passes, while
neglecting the substantial disparities in sampling costs introduced by
different scaling strategies. In this paper, we systematically compare the
efficiency of different test-time scaling strategies for ATP models and
demonstrate the inefficiency of the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) open-source
approaches. We then investigate approaches to significantly reduce token usage
and sample passes while maintaining the original performance. Specifically, we
propose two complementary methods that can be integrated into a unified EconRL
pipeline for amplified benefits: (1) a dynamic Chain-of-Thought (CoT) switching
mechanism designed to mitigate unnecessary token consumption, and (2) Diverse
parallel-scaled reinforcement learning (RL) with trainable prefixes to enhance
pass rates under constrained sampling passes. Experiments on miniF2F and
ProofNet demonstrate that our EconProver achieves comparable performance to
baseline methods with only 12% of the computational cost. This work provides
actionable insights for deploying lightweight ATP models without sacrificing
performance.

TL;DR: 本文提出Token-Aware Phase Attention (TAPA)方法，解决了RoPE位置编码在长上下文建模中的距离依赖偏差问题，通过可学习相位函数显著提升长文本处理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rotary Positional Embedding (RoPE)在实际应用中存在固有的距离依赖偏差，限制了其长上下文建模能力，而现有的扩展方法通常需要在预训练后进行后处理调整。

Method: 引入Token-Aware Phase Attention (TAPA)位置编码方法，在注意力机制中融入可学习的相位函数，保持长距离token交互，支持直接轻量微调扩展到更长上下文。

Result: TAPA能够外推到未见长度，在长上下文上获得比RoPE系列显著更低的困惑度(perplexity)。

Conclusion: TAPA是一种有效的长上下文位置编码解决方案，无需复杂的后处理调整即可实现更好的长文本建模性能。

Abstract: We prove under practical assumptions that Rotary Positional Embedding (RoPE)
introduces an intrinsic distance-dependent bias in attention scores that limits
RoPE's ability to model long-context. RoPE extension methods may alleviate this
issue, but they typically require post-hoc adjustments after pretraining, such
as rescaling or hyperparameters retuning. This paper introduces Token-Aware
Phase Attention (TAPA), a new positional encoding method that incorporates a
learnable phase function into the attention mechanism. TAPA preserves token
interactions over long range, extends to longer contexts with direct and light
fine-tuning, extrapolates to unseen lengths, and attains significantly lower
perplexity on long-context than RoPE families.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决基于大语言模型的自动语音识别系统中发音建模不足和同音词区分困难的问题，特别是在原始词和长尾词识别方面的挑战。

Method: 采用两阶段学习范式：1)发音引导的上下文学习方法，使用交错的字素-音素上下文建模策略；2)发音区分性强化学习方法，通过扰动标签采样增强同音词区分能力。

Result: 在英文Librispeech和中文AISHELL-1数据集上，相比预训练LLM-ASR模型，词错误率相对降低30.2%和53.8%；长尾词偏置错误率相对降低31.8%和60.5%。

Conclusion: PAC框架有效提升了LLM-ASR系统的发音建模能力和同音词区分性能，在原始词和长尾词识别方面取得了显著改进。

Abstract: This paper presents a Pronunciation-Aware Contextualized (PAC) framework to
address two key challenges in Large Language Model (LLM)-based Automatic Speech
Recognition (ASR) systems: effective pronunciation modeling and robust
homophone discrimination. Both are essential for raw or long-tail word
recognition. The proposed approach adopts a two-stage learning paradigm. First,
we introduce a pronunciation-guided context learning method. It employs an
interleaved grapheme-phoneme context modeling strategy that incorporates
grapheme-only distractors, encouraging the model to leverage phonemic cues for
accurate recognition. Then, we propose a pronunciation-discriminative
reinforcement learning method with perturbed label sampling to further enhance
the model\'s ability to distinguish contextualized homophones. Experimental
results on the public English Librispeech and Mandarin AISHELL-1 datasets
indicate that PAC: (1) reduces relative Word Error Rate (WER) by 30.2% and
53.8% compared to pre-trained LLM-based ASR models, and (2) achieves 31.8% and
60.5% relative reductions in biased WER for long-tail words compared to strong
baselines, respectively.

Motivation: 随着大语言模型在数百万用户产品中的广泛应用，其输出可能影响个人信念和塑造公众舆论。如果模型可以被有意引导至特定意识形态立场，控制这些系统的组织可能对公共话语产生不成比例的影响。

Method: 采用先前提出的统计方法，将其适配到意识形态偏见审计的新场景中。该方法具有模型无关性，不需要访问语言模型内部结构，而是通过分析模型在相关主题提示下输出的分布变化来识别潜在的意识形态操控。

Result: 通过一系列实验验证了该方法的有效性，证明了其实际适用性和支持对大语言模型行为进行独立事后审计的潜力。

Conclusion: 该方法为检测大语言模型意识形态操控提供了有效的工具，特别适合对专有黑盒系统进行审计，有助于确保AI系统的透明性和问责制。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly embedded in products used
by millions, their outputs may influence individual beliefs and, cumulatively,
shape public opinion. If the behavior of LLMs can be intentionally steered
toward specific ideological positions, such as political or religious views,
then those who control these systems could gain disproportionate influence over
public discourse. Although it remains an open question whether LLMs can
reliably be guided toward coherent ideological stances and whether such
steering can be effectively prevented, a crucial first step is to develop
methods for detecting when such steering attempts occur. In this work, we adapt
a previously proposed statistical method to the new context of ideological bias
auditing. Our approach carries over the model-agnostic design of the original
framework, which does not require access to the internals of the language
model. Instead, it identifies potential ideological steering by analyzing
distributional shifts in model outputs across prompts that are thematically
related to a chosen topic. This design makes the method particularly suitable
for auditing proprietary black-box systems. We validate our approach through a
series of experiments, demonstrating its practical applicability and its
potential to support independent post hoc audits of LLM behavior.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在情感支持对话中存在策略规划准确性低和明显偏好偏差的问题，现有方法虽然通过微调策略规划器显示了一定潜力，但偏好偏差的根本原因尚未得到充分研究。

Method: 首先揭示LLMs策略规划知识边界的根本原因，然后提出基于强化学习的双奖励函数方法，根据知识边界通过准确性和基于熵的置信度来优化策略规划。

Result: 在ESCov和ExTES数据集上的多个LLM骨干网络实验表明，该方法优于基线方法，证实了其有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法成功缓解了大语言模型在情感支持对话中的策略规划偏好偏差问题，通过知识边界分析和双奖励函数优化实现了更好的性能。

Abstract: Emotional support conversation (ESC) aims to alleviate distress through
empathetic dialogue, yet large language models (LLMs) face persistent
challenges in delivering effective ESC due to low accuracy in strategy
planning. Moreover, there is a considerable preference bias towards specific
strategies. Prior methods using fine-tuned strategy planners have shown
potential in reducing such bias, while the underlying causes of the preference
bias in LLMs have not well been studied. To address these issues, we first
reveal the fundamental causes of the bias by identifying the knowledge
boundaries of LLMs in strategy planning. Then, we propose an approach to
mitigate the bias by reinforcement learning with a dual reward function, which
optimizes strategy planning via both accuracy and entropy-based confidence for
each region according to the knowledge boundaries. Experiments on the ESCov and
ExTES datasets with multiple LLM backbones show that our approach outperforms
the baselines, confirming the effectiveness of our approach.

Abstract: Text-based person search (TBPS) enables the retrieval of person images from
large-scale databases using natural language descriptions, offering critical
value in surveillance applications. However, a major challenge lies in the
labor-intensive process of obtaining high-quality textual annotations, which
limits scalability and practical deployment. To address this, we introduce two
complementary modules: Multi-Turn Text Generation (MTG) and Multi-Turn Text
Interaction (MTI). MTG generates rich pseudo-labels through simulated dialogues
with MLLMs, producing fine-grained and diverse visual descriptions without
manual supervision. MTI refines user queries at inference time through dynamic,
dialogue-based reasoning, enabling the system to interpret and resolve vague,
incomplete, or ambiguous descriptions - characteristics often seen in
real-world search scenarios. Together, MTG and MTI form a unified and
annotation-free framework that significantly improves retrieval accuracy,
robustness, and usability. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our method
achieves competitive or superior results while eliminating the need for manual
captions, paving the way for scalable and practical deployment of TBPS systems.

Conclusion: 研究揭示了模型训练中的公平性和鲁棒性差距，为开发更具包容性的毒性检测模型提供了重要见解，机制解释性方法能有效识别和缓解分类器漏洞。

Abstract: The volume of machine-generated content online has grown dramatically due to
the widespread use of Large Language Models (LLMs), leading to new challenges
for content moderation systems. Conventional content moderation classifiers,
which are usually trained on text produced by humans, suffer from
misclassifications due to LLM-generated text deviating from their training data
and adversarial attacks that aim to avoid detection. Present-day defence
tactics are reactive rather than proactive, since they rely on adversarial
training or external detection models to identify attacks. In this work, we aim
to identify the vulnerable components of toxicity classifiers that contribute
to misclassification, proposing a novel strategy based on mechanistic
interpretability techniques. Our study focuses on fine-tuned BERT and RoBERTa
classifiers, testing on diverse datasets spanning a variety of minority groups.
We use adversarial attacking techniques to identify vulnerable circuits.
Finally, we suppress these vulnerable circuits, improving performance against
adversarial attacks. We also provide demographic-level insights into these
vulnerable circuits, exposing fairness and robustness gaps in model training.
We find that models have distinct heads that are either crucial for performance
or vulnerable to attack and suppressing the vulnerable heads improves
performance on adversarial input. We also find that different heads are
responsible for vulnerability across different demographic groups, which can
inform more inclusive development of toxicity detection models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出基于案例的决策理论解码方法，通过使用领域数据样本来估计期望效用，解决了MBR解码在处理域外知识时的局限性，在多个翻译和图像描述任务中表现优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MBR解码依赖于从文本生成模型中采样的文本，难以准确捕获域外知识或信息，需要一种能够更好处理域外领域的方法。

Method: 提出基于案例的决策理论解码方法，使用领域数据样本来估计期望效用，结合了MBR和CBDT解码的优势。

Result: 在7个德-英和日-英翻译任务以及MSCOCO和nocaps数据集的图像描述任务中，MBR和CBDT组合解码方法优于单独的MBR解码。

Conclusion: CBDT解码不仅比MAP解码生成更高质量的文本，而且与MBR解码结合后能够显著提升在域外知识处理方面的性能。

Abstract: Minimum Bayes risk (MBR) decoding is a decision rule of text generation,
which selects the hypothesis that maximizes the expected utility and robustly
generates higher-quality texts than maximum a posteriori (MAP) decoding.
However, it depends on sample texts drawn from the text generation model; thus,
it is difficult to find a hypothesis that correctly captures the knowledge or
information of out-of-domain. To tackle this issue, we propose case-based
decision-theoretic (CBDT) decoding, another method to estimate the expected
utility using examples of domain data. CBDT decoding not only generates
higher-quality texts than MAP decoding, but also the combination of MBR and
CBDT decoding outperformed MBR decoding in seven domain De--En and
Ja$\leftrightarrow$En translation tasks and image captioning tasks on MSCOCO
and nocaps datasets.

TL;DR: HistoryBank是一个多语言历史事件数据库，包含1000万+事件，覆盖10种语言，并构建了全面的时序推理问答基准来评估大语言模型的历史事件理解能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有时序推理数据集规模有限、缺乏多语言覆盖且偏重当代事件，需要构建更全面的历史事件数据库和评估基准来推动多语言时序感知的自然语言理解研究。

Method: 从维基百科时间线页面和文章信息框中提取历史事件，构建包含10种语言的1000万+事件数据库，并设计6种时序问答任务来评估语言模型性能。

Result: GPT4o在所有答案类型和语言中表现最佳；Gemma-2在小型语言模型中表现最优。数据库提供了前所未有的历史深度和语言广度覆盖。

Conclusion: HistoryBank为推进多语言和时序感知的历史事件自然语言理解提供了全面资源，代码和数据集将在论文接受后公开以促进进一步研究。

Abstract: Temporal reasoning about historical events is a critical skill for NLP tasks
like event extraction, historical entity linking, temporal question answering,
timeline summarization, temporal event clustering and temporal natural language
inference. Yet efforts on benchmarking temporal reasoning capabilities of large
language models (LLMs) are rather limited. Existing temporal reasoning datasets
are limited in scale, lack multilingual coverage and focus more on contemporary
events. To address these limitations, we present HistoryBank, a multilingual
database of 10M+ historical events extracted from Wikipedia timeline pages and
article infoboxes. Our database provides unprecedented coverage in both
historical depth and linguistic breadth with 10 languages. Additionally, we
construct a comprehensive question answering benchmark for temporal reasoning
across all languages. This benchmark covers a diverse set of 6 temporal QA
reasoning tasks, and we evaluate a suite of popular language models
(LLaMA-3-8B, Mistral-7B, Gemma-2-9b, Qwen3-8B, GPT4o) to assess their
performance on these tasks. As expected GPT4o performs best across all answer
types and languages; Gemma-2 outperforms the other small language models. Our
work aims to provide a comprehensive resource for advancing multilingual and
temporally-aware natural language understanding of historical events. To
facilitate further research, we will make our code and datasets publicly
available upon acceptance of this paper.

TL;DR: 本文提出CLEAR GLASS模型，通过新颖的分组对比损失技术，使视觉语言模型具备概念抽象能力，能够识别图像中的高级概念信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类能够识别图像作为一般概念的实例，而不仅仅是识别其中的对象和关系。本研究旨在探索视觉语言模型是否具备这种概念抽象能力，以及如何编码图像中的高级概念信息。

Method: 引入分组图像-标题数据集MAGIC，使用基于文本-图像对比组的分组对比损失函数（外部对比损失）和组内实例距离度量的内部损失，通过对比学习技术诱导模型编码图像组中共有的信息。

Result: 实验表明，这种训练方法使CLEAR GLASS模型在抽象概念识别方面相比最先进模型有所改进，概念抽象能力作为涌现能力出现。

Conclusion: 提出的分组对比损失训练方法能够有效提升视觉语言模型的概念抽象能力，使模型能够在未接触高级概念标签的情况下，在潜在语义空间中接近高级概念的语义表示。

Abstract: Humans can recognize an image as an instance of a general concept, beyond
simply identifying its objects and their relationships. In this paper, we
investigate 1. The extent to which VLMs have this concept abstraction capacity,
and 2. Strategies for encoding the sort of higher-concept information in images
that would enable the resulting VLM model (CLEAR GLASS model) to have this
capability to a greater degree. To this end, we introduce a grouped
image-caption dataset (MAGIC), which consists of several groups of image
captions and for each group a set of associated images and higher-level
conceptual labels. We use a novel contrastive loss technique to induce the
model to encode in the representation of each image (caption) in a group the
information that is common to all members of the image-caption group. Our main
contribution is a grouped contrastive loss function based on text-image
contrastive groups (outer contrastive loss) as well as an inner loss which
measures the distances between image-caption instances in the group. Our
training methodology results in the CLEAR GLASS model having the concept
abstraction capacity as an emergent capacity because the model is not exposed
to the higher-level concepts associated with each group. Instead, the training
forces the model to create for each image-caption group a semantic
representation that brings it closer to the semantic representation of the
higher-level concepts in the latent semantic space. Our experiments show that
this training methodology results in a model which shows improvement in
abstract concept recognition compared to SOTA models.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的"自下而上"数据驱动框架，通过"检索优先、聚类结构化"策略，先建立知识边界再进行生成规划，有效解决了长文本生成中的事实准确性和内容碎片化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有"自上而下"方法在生成假设或大纲后再检索证据，容易导致模型计划与可用知识脱节，造成内容碎片化和事实不准确。需要一种能够严格约束生成内容、确保可追溯性的新方法。

Method: 采用"检索优先获取知识，聚类形成结构"策略：首先从知识库进行详尽迭代检索，然后使用无监督聚类算法将检索到的文档组织成不同的"知识簇"，这些簇为后续层次化大纲和最终文档内容的生成提供数据驱动的基础。

Result: 在14B和32B参数模型上的实验结果表明，该方法达到或超过了最先进基线的性能，在需要高保真度和结构连贯性的知识约束场景中展现出独特优势。

Conclusion: 该方法为生成可靠、结构化的长文档提供了有效范式，为在高风险、知识密集型领域中开发更稳健的LLM应用铺平了道路。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable prowess in text
generation, yet producing long-form, factual documents grounded in extensive
external knowledge bases remains a significant challenge. Existing "top-down"
methods, which first generate a hypothesis or outline and then retrieve
evidence, often suffer from a disconnect between the model's plan and the
available knowledge, leading to content fragmentation and factual inaccuracies.
To address these limitations, we propose a novel "bottom-up," data-driven
framework that inverts the conventional generation pipeline. Our approach is
predicated on a "Retrieval-First for Knowledge, Clustering for Structure"
strategy, which first establishes the "knowledge boundaries" of the source
corpus before any generative planning occurs. Specifically, we perform
exhaustive iterative retrieval from the knowledge base and then employ an
unsupervised clustering algorithm to organize the retrieved documents into
distinct "knowledge clusters." These clusters form an objective, data-driven
foundation that directly guides the subsequent generation of a hierarchical
outline and the final document content. This bottom-up process ensures that the
generated text is strictly constrained by and fully traceable to the source
material, proactively adapting to the finite scope of the knowledge base and
fundamentally mitigating the risk of hallucination. Experimental results on
both 14B and 32B parameter models demonstrate that our method achieves
performance comparable to or exceeding state-of-the-art baselines, and is
expected to demonstrate unique advantages in knowledge-constrained scenarios
that demand high fidelity and structural coherence. Our work presents an
effective paradigm for generating reliable, structured, long-form documents,
paving the way for more robust LLM applications in high-stakes,
knowledge-intensive domains.

Motivation: 马耳他语作为受罗曼语和日耳曼语影响的独特闪族语言，与阿拉伯语存在文字系统差异，研究如何利用阿拉伯语资源弥补马耳他语数据稀缺问题

Method: 采用多种跨语言对齐策略，包括不同音译方案和机器翻译方法，开发了新的马耳他语音译系统，评估单语和多语模型的增强效果

Result: 阿拉伯语为基础的增强技术能显著提升马耳他语NLP任务性能

Conclusion: 阿拉伯语资源可以有效支持马耳他语NLP，跨语言增强是解决低资源语言处理问题的有效途径

Abstract: Maltese is a unique Semitic language that has evolved under extensive
influence from Romance and Germanic languages, particularly Italian and
English. Despite its Semitic roots, its orthography is based on the Latin
script, creating a gap between it and its closest linguistic relatives in
Arabic. In this paper, we explore whether Arabic-language resources can support
Maltese natural language processing (NLP) through cross-lingual augmentation
techniques. We investigate multiple strategies for aligning Arabic textual data
with Maltese, including various transliteration schemes and machine translation
(MT) approaches. As part of this, we also introduce novel transliteration
systems that better represent Maltese orthography. We evaluate the impact of
these augmentations on monolingual and mutlilingual models and demonstrate that
Arabic-based augmentation can significantly benefit Maltese NLP tasks.

Motivation: 现有方法依赖重复采样、辅助模型或微调目标模型，计算成本高且可能影响通用性，需要更高效的难度估计方法

Method: 将token级生成过程建模为马尔可夫链，定义价值函数来估计给定隐藏状态的预期输出质量，仅利用初始隐藏状态进行难度估计

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种高效准确的LLM问题难度估计方案，无需额外计算开销，为自适应推理提供了有效指导

Abstract: Estimating the difficulty of input questions as perceived by large language
models (LLMs) is essential for accurate performance evaluation and adaptive
inference. Existing methods typically rely on repeated response sampling,
auxiliary models, or fine-tuning the target model itself, which may incur
substantial computational costs or compromise generality. In this paper, we
propose a novel approach for difficulty estimation that leverages only the
hidden representations produced by the target LLM. We model the token-level
generation process as a Markov chain and define a value function to estimate
the expected output quality given any hidden state. This allows for efficient
and accurate difficulty estimation based solely on the initial hidden state,
without generating any output tokens. Extensive experiments across both textual
and multimodal tasks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms
existing baselines in difficulty estimation. Moreover, we apply our difficulty
estimates to guide adaptive reasoning strategies, including Self-Consistency,
Best-of-N, and Self-Refine, achieving higher inference efficiency with fewer
generated tokens.

Result: 仅用14亿参数就在Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB)和中文MTEB (2025年5月19日)上实现了最先进的性能

Conclusion: 通过从零开始训练、软掩码机制和动态硬负样本挖掘，Conan-embedding-v2成功解决了LLMs与嵌入模型之间的训练差距，在小参数规模下实现了优异的嵌入性能

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated excellent performance
in text embedding tasks. Previous work usually use LoRA to fine-tune existing
LLMs, which are limited by the data and training gap between LLMs and embedding
models. In this work, we introduce Conan-embedding-v2, a new 1.4B-parameter LLM
trained from scratch and fine-tuned as a text embedder. First, we add news data
and multilingual pairs for LLM pretraining to bridge the data gap. Based on
this, we propose a cross-lingual retrieval dataset that enables the LLM to
better integrate embeddings across different languages. Second, whereas LLMs
use a causal mask with token-level loss, embedding models use a bidirectional
mask with sentence-level loss. This training gap makes full fine-tuning less
effective than LoRA. We introduce a soft-masking mechanism to gradually
transition between these two types of masks, enabling the model to learn more
comprehensive representations. Based on this, we propose a dynamic hard
negative mining method that exposes the model to more difficult negative
examples throughout the training process. Being intuitive and effective, with
only approximately 1.4B parameters, Conan-embedding-v2 achieves SOTA
performance on both the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB) and Chinese
MTEB (May 19, 2025).

Conclusion: 基于图的置信度估计方法能有效提升大语言模型在推理任务上的可靠性，为模型部署提供更好的置信度评估

Abstract: Confidence estimation is essential for the reliable deployment of large
language models (LLMs). Existing methods are primarily designed for factual QA
tasks and often fail to generalize to reasoning tasks. To address this gap, we
propose a set of training-free, graph-based confidence estimation methods
tailored to reasoning tasks. Our approach models reasoning paths as directed
graphs and estimates confidence by exploiting graph properties such as
centrality, path convergence, and path weighting. Experiments with two LLMs on
three reasoning datasets demonstrate improved confidence estimation and
enhanced performance on two downstream tasks.

Motivation: 探索参数高效方法如LoRA在预训练中的扩展应用，特别是在计算和环境成本更低的小型语言模型(SLMs)中，理解ReLoRA在SLM预训练中的表现和学习动态。

Method: 对11M-66M参数的小型语言模型进行ReLoRA预训练的系统研究，通过消融实验评估性能损失、Paloma困惑度和BLiMP指标，并分析学习动态。

Result: ReLoRA在损失、Paloma困惑度和BLiMP方面普遍表现不如标准训练，模型规模越大性能差距越明显；学习动态分析显示ReLoRA会加剧小模型中已有的秩不足问题。

Conclusion: 低秩更新策略可能难以直接迁移到小型语言模型预训练中，需要在低计算资源环境下进行更多研究。

Abstract: Parameter-efficient methods such as LoRA have revolutionised the fine-tuning
of LLMs. Still, their extension to pretraining via ReLoRA is less well
understood, especially for small language models (SLMs), which offer lower
computational and environmental costs. This work is the first systematic study
of ReLoRA in SLMs (11M-66M parameters), evaluating both performance and
learning dynamics. Through ablation experiments, we find that ReLoRA generally
performs worse than standard training on loss, Paloma perplexity and BLiMP,
with the gap widening for the larger models. Further analysis of the learning
dynamics of the models indicates that ReLoRA reinforces the rank deficiencies
found in smaller models. These results indicate that low-rank update strategies
may not transfer easily to SLM pretraining, highlighting the need for more
research in the low-compute regime.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have opened the door to
culture-aware language tasks. We introduce the novel problem of adapting wine
reviews across Chinese and English, which goes beyond literal translation by
incorporating regional taste preferences and culture-specific flavor
descriptors. In a case study on cross-cultural wine review adaptation, we
compile the first parallel corpus of professional reviews, containing 8k
Chinese and 16k Anglophone reviews. We benchmark both
neural-machine-translation baselines and state-of-the-art LLMs with automatic
metrics and human evaluation. For the latter, we propose three culture-oriented
criteria -- Cultural Proximity, Cultural Neutrality, and Cultural Genuineness
-- to assess how naturally a translated review resonates with target-culture
readers. Our analysis shows that current models struggle to capture cultural
nuances, especially in translating wine descriptions across different cultures.
This highlights the challenges and limitations of translation models in
handling cultural content.

Abstract: Poor sitting posture is a critical yet often overlooked factor contributing
to long-term musculoskeletal disorders and physiological dysfunctions. Existing
sitting posture monitoring systems, although leveraging visual, IMU, or

lack the semantic expressiveness necessary for personalized feedback. In this
paper, we propose \textbf{SitLLM}, a lightweight multimodal framework that
integrates flexible pressure sensing with large language models (LLMs) to
enable fine-grained posture understanding and personalized health-oriented
response generation. SitLLM comprises three key components: (1) a
\textit{Gaussian-Robust Sensor Embedding Module} that partitions pressure maps
into spatial patches and injects local noise perturbations for robust feature
extraction; (2) a \textit{Prompt-Driven Cross-Modal Alignment Module} that
reprograms sensor embeddings into the LLM's semantic space via multi-head
cross-attention using the pre-trained vocabulary embeddings; and (3) a
\textit{Multi-Context Prompt Module} that fuses feature-level, structure-level,
statistical-level, and semantic-level contextual information to guide

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
many domains, yet their application to specialized fields remains constrained
by the scarcity and complexity of domain-specific training data. We present a
novel approach that achieves a 261x cost reduction for maritime intelligence by
using LLMs as one-time teachers rather than using them directly for inference.
Our method transforms 3.2 billion Automatic Identification System (AIS) vessel
tracking records into 21,543 synthetic question and answer pairs through
multi-model generation (GPT-4o and o3-mini), preventing overfitting and
ensuring accurate reasoning. The resulting fine-tuned Qwen2.5-7B model achieves
75% accuracy on maritime tasks, while being substantially cheaper than using a
larger model for inference. We show that smaller, cheaper models -- when fine
tuned properly -- can provide similar accuracy compared to larger models that
are prohibitively expensive. Our work contributes to the growing field of
synthetic dataset generation for specialized AI applications and presents a
highly reproducible framework for domains where manual annotation is
infeasible. Beyond expanding research in the growing field of specialized small
language models, our approach has immediate applications in maritime safety,
security operations, and vessel traffic management systems in various
industries.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at generating human-like text,
aligning their outputs with complex, qualitative goals like pedagogical
soundness remains a significant challenge. Standard reinforcement learning
techniques often rely on slow and expensive LLM-as-a-judge evaluations or on
brittle, keyword-based metrics like ROUGE, which fail to capture the semantic
essence of a high-quality explanation. In this work, we introduce a novel
approach to reward shaping within the Group Relative Policy Optimisation (GRPO)
framework. Our central contribution is the use of a small, efficient
encoder-only transformer as a semantic reward model. This model provides a
dense, semantically rich reward signal based on the cosine similarity between a
generated explanation and a ground-truth reference, guiding the policy towards
explanations that are not just factually correct but also structurally and
conceptually aligned with expert reasoning. We apply this method to the task of
training a model for the Italian medical-school entrance examinations,
following standard domain-adaptive continued pre-training (CPT) and supervised
fine-tuning (SFT). Our results demonstrate that GRPO with our proposed semantic
reward significantly improves explanation faithfulness and clarity over a
strong SFT baseline, showcasing the power of using lightweight encoder models
for nuanced reward shaping in complex generation tasks

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models(LLMs) have led to the
development of LLM-based AI agents. A key challenge is the creation of agents
that can effectively ground themselves in complex, adversarial long-horizon
environments. Existing methods mainly focus on (1) using LLMs as policies to
interact with the environment through generating low-level feasible actions,
and (2) utilizing LLMs to generate high-level tasks or language guides to
stimulate action generation. However, the former struggles to generate reliable
actions, while the latter relies heavily on expert experience to translate
high-level tasks into specific action sequences. To address these challenges,
we introduce the Plan with Language, Act with Parameter (PLAP) planning
framework that facilitates the grounding of LLM-based agents in long-horizon
environments. The PLAP method comprises three key components: (1) a skill
library containing environment-specific parameterized skills, (2) a skill
planner powered by LLMs, and (3) a skill executor converting the parameterized
skills into executable action sequences. We implement PLAP in MicroRTS, a
long-horizon real-time strategy game that provides an unfamiliar and
challenging environment for LLMs. The experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness of PLAP. In particular, GPT-4o-driven PLAP in a zero-shot setting
outperforms 80% of baseline agents, and Qwen2-72B-driven PLAP, with carefully

### [145] [LLM Hallucination Detection: A Fast Fourier Transform Method Based on Hidden Layer Temporal Signals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13154)
*Jinxin Li,Gang Tu,ShengYu Cheng,Junjie Hu,Jinting Wang,Rui Chen,Zhilong Zhou,Dongbo Shan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: HSAD是一种基于隐藏信号分析的幻觉检测框架，通过建模自回归生成过程中隐藏表示的时间动态，在频域分析中提取最强非直流频率分量作为特征，在多个基准测试中相比现有方法提升超过10个百分点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有幻觉检测方法存在局限性：事实性检查受外部知识覆盖范围限制，静态隐藏状态分析无法捕捉推理动态中的偏差，导致检测效果和鲁棒性有限。

Method: HSAD框架通过采样各层激活构建隐藏层信号，应用快速傅里叶变换获得频域表示，提取最强非直流频率分量作为频谱特征，并利用LLMs的自回归特性识别最佳观测点。

Result: 在包括TruthfulQA在内的多个基准测试中，HSAD相比先前最先进方法实现了超过10个百分点的改进。

Conclusion: 通过将推理过程建模与频域分析相结合，HSAD为LLMs中的鲁棒幻觉检测建立了新范式。

Abstract: Hallucination remains a critical barrier for deploying large language models
(LLMs) in reliability-sensitive applications. Existing detection methods
largely fall into two categories: factuality checking, which is fundamentally
constrained by external knowledge coverage, and static hidden-state analysis,
that fails to capture deviations in reasoning dynamics. As a result, their
effectiveness and robustness remain limited. We propose HSAD (Hidden Signal
Analysis-based Detection), a novel hallucination detection framework that
models the temporal dynamics of hidden representations during autoregressive
generation. HSAD constructs hidden-layer signals by sampling activations across
layers, applies Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to obtain frequency-domain
representations, and extracts the strongest non-DC frequency component as
spectral features. Furthermore, by leveraging the autoregressive nature of
LLMs, HSAD identifies optimal observation points for effective and reliable
detection. Across multiple benchmarks, including TruthfulQA, HSAD achieves over
10 percentage points improvement compared to prior state-of-the-art methods. By
integrating reasoning-process modeling with frequency-domain analysis, HSAD
establishes a new paradigm for robust hallucination detection in LLMs.

*Yongjian Tang,Doruk Tuncel,Christian Koerner,Thomas Runkler*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现大语言模型存在过度提示问题，过多的领域特定示例反而会降低性能，通过TF-IDF和分层抽样方法确定了各LLM的最佳示例数量，在需求分类任务上超越现有方法1%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 挑战传统少样本学习的认知，研究过度提示现象（过多示例导致性能下降），特别是在LLM辅助软件工程和需求分析的背景下

Method: 使用随机抽样、语义嵌入和TF-IDF向量三种少样本选择方法，在多个LLM上评估，通过逐步增加TF-IDF选择和分层少样本示例数量来确定最优数量

Result: 实验发现过度添加领域特定示例会降低某些LLM性能，与先前经验结论相矛盾；组合方法用更少示例实现更好性能，在功能和非功能需求分类上超越SOTA 1%

Conclusion: 过度提示是真实存在的问题，需要为不同LLM确定最佳示例数量；TF-IDF和分层抽样组合方法能有效避免过度提示问题，提升少样本学习效果

Abstract: Over-prompting, a phenomenon where excessive examples in prompts lead to
diminished performance in Large Language Models (LLMs), challenges the
conventional wisdom about in-context few-shot learning. To investigate this
few-shot dilemma, we outline a prompting framework that leverages three
standard few-shot selection methods - random sampling, semantic embedding, and
TF-IDF vectors - and evaluate these methods across multiple LLMs, including
GPT-4o, GPT-3.5-turbo, DeepSeek-V3, Gemma-3, LLaMA-3.1, LLaMA-3.2, and Mistral.
Our experimental results reveal that incorporating excessive domain-specific
examples into prompts can paradoxically degrade performance in certain LLMs,
which contradicts the prior empirical conclusion that more relevant few-shot
examples universally benefit LLMs. Given the trend of LLM-assisted software
engineering and requirement analysis, we experiment with two real-world
software requirement classification datasets. By gradually increasing the
number of TF-IDF-selected and stratified few-shot examples, we identify their
optimal quantity for each LLM. This combined approach achieves superior
performance with fewer examples, avoiding the over-prompting problem, thus
surpassing the state-of-the-art by 1% in classifying functional and
non-functional requirements.

*Jianfeng Zhu,Julina Maharjan,Xinyu Li,Karin G. Coifman,Ruoming Jin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLM在人格特质评估方面表现有限，所有模型预测与真实人格特质的Pearson相关系数均低于0.26，表明当前LLM与验证心理学构念的对齐程度有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM在需要心理理解的角色中部署增加（如情感支持代理、咨询师等），需要评估其在生态有效对话环境中解释人类人格特质的能力，而现有研究主要使用离散标签在社交媒体数据上模拟LLM"人格"，缺乏对连续真实人格评估的对齐研究。

Method: 引入包含半结构化访谈记录和验证连续大五人格特质分数的新基准，系统评估三种范式：(1)GPT-4.1 Mini的零样本和思维链提示；(2)RoBERTa和Meta-LLaMA架构的LoRA微调；(3)使用预训练BERT和OpenAI文本嵌入的回归分析。

Result: 所有模型预测与真实人格特质的Pearson相关系数均低于0.26，思维链提示相比零样本提示提升有限，表明人格推断更多依赖潜在语义表征而非显式推理。

Conclusion: 研究结果强调了将LLM与复杂人类属性对齐的挑战，为未来特质特定提示、上下文感知建模和对齐导向微调的研究提供了动机。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in roles requiring
nuanced psychological understanding, such as emotional support agents,
counselors, and decision-making assistants. However, their ability to interpret
human personality traits, a critical aspect of such applications, remains
unexplored, particularly in ecologically valid conversational settings. While
prior work has simulated LLM "personas" using discrete Big Five labels on
social media data, the alignment of LLMs with continuous, ground-truth
personality assessments derived from natural interactions is largely
unexamined. To address this gap, we introduce a novel benchmark comprising
semi-structured interview transcripts paired with validated continuous Big Five
trait scores. Using this dataset, we systematically evaluate LLM performance
across three paradigms: (1) zero-shot and chain-of-thought prompting with
GPT-4.1 Mini, (2) LoRA-based fine-tuning applied to both RoBERTa and Meta-LLaMA
architectures, and (3) regression using static embeddings from pretrained BERT
and OpenAI's text-embedding-3-small. Our results reveal that all Pearson
correlations between model predictions and ground-truth personality traits
remain below 0.26, highlighting the limited alignment of current LLMs with
validated psychological constructs. Chain-of-thought prompting offers minimal
gains over zero-shot, suggesting that personality inference relies more on
latent semantic representation than explicit reasoning. These findings
underscore the challenges of aligning LLMs with complex human attributes and
motivate future work on trait-specific prompting, context-aware modeling, and
alignment-oriented fine-tuning.

TL;DR: ChartGaze是一个新的眼动追踪数据集，通过比较人类和模型注意力模式，发现LVLMs在图表问答任务中注意力与人类存在差异，提出基于人类注视的注意力优化方法，显著提升了模型准确性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图表是重要的信息可视化媒介，但现有大型视觉语言模型在图表问答任务中经常关注不相关区域，导致解释性和准确性不足，需要研究如何让模型注意力更接近人类注视模式。

Method: 构建ChartGaze眼动追踪数据集，系统比较人类和模型注意力差异，提出基于人类注视的注意力优化方法，将图像-文本注意力与人类注视点对齐。

Result: 该方法在多个模型上实现了最高2.56个百分点的准确率提升，同时显著改善了注意力对齐效果。

Conclusion: 人类注视信息可以有效提升图表相关LVLMs的推理质量和可解释性，为视觉语言模型优化提供了新的方向。

Abstract: Charts are a crucial visual medium for communicating and representing
information. While Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have made progress on
chart question answering (CQA), the task remains challenging, particularly when
models attend to irrelevant regions of the chart. In this work, we present
ChartGaze, a new eye-tracking dataset that captures human gaze patterns during
chart reasoning tasks. Through a systematic comparison of human and model
attention, we find that LVLMs often diverge from human gaze, leading to reduced
interpretability and accuracy. To address this, we propose a gaze-guided
attention refinement that aligns image-text attention with human fixations. Our
approach improves both answer accuracy and attention alignment, yielding gains
of up to 2.56 percentage points across multiple models. These results
demonstrate the promise of incorporating human gaze to enhance both the
reasoning quality and interpretability of chart-focused LVLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI代理在自主发现和合成外部知识时面临上下文饱和和噪声污染的问题，需要新的框架来克服这些限制。

Method: 提出WebResearcher迭代深度研究范式（将深度研究建模为马尔可夫决策过程）和WebFrontier可扩展数据合成引擎（通过工具增强的复杂性升级生成高质量训练数据）。

Result: 在6个具有挑战性的基准测试中实现了最先进的性能，甚至超越了前沿专有系统，训练数据显著提升了传统单上下文方法的工具使用能力。

Conclusion: WebResearcher框架通过并行思维自然扩展，支持并发多代理探索，能够产生更全面的结论，为自主知识发现和合成提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in deep-research systems have demonstrated the potential for
AI agents to autonomously discover and synthesize knowledge from external
sources. In this paper, we introduce WebResearcher, a novel framework for
building such agents through two key components: (1) WebResearcher, an
iterative deep-research paradigm that reformulates deep research as a Markov
Decision Process, where agents periodically consolidate findings into evolving
reports while maintaining focused workspaces, overcoming the context
suffocation and noise contamination that plague existing mono-contextual
approaches; and (2) WebFrontier, a scalable data synthesis engine that
generates high-quality training data through tool-augmented complexity
escalation, enabling systematic creation of research tasks that bridge the gap
between passive knowledge recall and active knowledge construction. Notably, we
find that the training data from our paradigm significantly enhances tool-use
capabilities even for traditional mono-contextual methods. Furthermore, our
paradigm naturally scales through parallel thinking, enabling concurrent
multi-agent exploration for more comprehensive conclusions. Extensive
experiments across 6 challenging benchmarks demonstrate that WebResearcher
achieves state-of-the-art performance, even surpassing frontier proprietary
systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大型语言模型在智能体任务中表现不佳，主要原因是缺乏强大的智能体基础模型，导致模型需要在后训练过程中同时学习多种智能体行为并与专家演示对齐，造成优化冲突。

Method: 提出Agentic Continual Pre-training方法，将其整合到深度研究智能体训练流程中，构建强大的智能体基础模型，并开发了AgentFounder模型。

Result: AgentFounder-30B在10个基准测试中取得最先进性能，包括BrowseComp-en上39.9%、BrowseComp-zh上43.3%、HLE上31.5% Pass@1的优异表现，同时保持了强大的工具使用能力。

Conclusion: Agentic CPT方法有效解决了智能体基础模型缺失的问题，AgentFounder模型在多个智能体任务基准上实现了突破性性能，为智能体系统的发展提供了重要基础。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have evolved into agentic systems capable of
autonomous tool use and multi-step reasoning for complex problem-solving.
However, post-training approaches building upon general-purpose foundation
models consistently underperform in agentic tasks, particularly in open-source
implementations. We identify the root cause: the absence of robust agentic
foundation models forces models during post-training to simultaneously learn
diverse agentic behaviors while aligning them to expert demonstrations, thereby
creating fundamental optimization tensions. To this end, we are the first to
propose incorporating Agentic Continual Pre-training (Agentic CPT) into the
deep research agents training pipeline to build powerful agentic foundational
models. Based on this approach, we develop a deep research agent model named
AgentFounder. We evaluate our AgentFounder-30B on 10 benchmarks and achieve
state-of-the-art performance while retains strong tool-use ability, notably
39.9% on BrowseComp-en, 43.3% on BrowseComp-zh, and 31.5% Pass@1 on HLE.

Motivation: 现实世界API需要精确、鲁棒的函数调用智能，代理能力的广度与训练环境的多样性密切相关，因此需要扩展环境来推进通用代理智能发展。

Method: 设计可扩展框架自动构建完全模拟的异构环境，采用两阶段代理微调策略：先赋予基础代理能力，再进行领域专业化训练。

Result: 在tau-bench、tau2-Bench和ACEBench等代理基准测试中，AgentScaler模型显著增强了模型的函数调用能力。

Conclusion: 通过规模化环境构建和两阶段训练策略，有效提升了代理智能的函数调用性能，为实际应用部署奠定了基础。

Abstract: Advanced agentic intelligence is a prerequisite for deploying Large Language
Models in practical, real-world applications. Diverse real-world APIs demand
precise, robust function-calling intelligence, which needs agents to develop
these capabilities through interaction in varied environments. The breadth of
function-calling competence is closely tied to the diversity of environments in
which agents are trained. In this work, we scale up environments as a step
towards advancing general agentic intelligence. This gives rise to two central
challenges: (i) how to scale environments in a principled manner, and (ii) how
to effectively train agentic capabilities from experiences derived through
interactions with these environments. To address these, we design a scalable
framework that automatically constructs heterogeneous environments that are
fully simulated, systematically broadening the space of function-calling
scenarios. We further adapt a two-phase agent fine-tuning strategy: first
endowing agents with fundamental agentic capabilities, then specializing them
for domain-specific contexts. Extensive experiments on agentic benchmarks,
tau-bench, tau2-Bench, and ACEBench, demonstrate that our trained model,
AgentScaler, significantly enhances the function-calling capability of models.

Method: 提出双智能体框架：规划器动态循环迭代获取证据并优化大纲，写作者执行分层检索和分段写作过程，针对性检索必要证据

Result: 在DeepResearch Bench、DeepConsult和DeepResearchGym等主要OEDR基准测试中建立了新的最先进水平

Conclusion: 验证了以人为中心的迭代方法，证明自适应规划和聚焦合成对于产生高质量、可靠且结构良好的报告至关重要

Abstract: This paper tackles open-ended deep research (OEDR), a complex challenge where
AI agents must synthesize vast web-scale information into insightful reports.
Current approaches are plagued by dual-fold limitations: static research
pipelines that decouple planning from evidence acquisition and one-shot
generation paradigms that easily suffer from long-context failure issues like
"loss in the middle" and hallucinations. To address these challenges, we
introduce WebWeaver, a novel dual-agent framework that emulates the human
research process. The planner operates in a dynamic cycle, iteratively
interleaving evidence acquisition with outline optimization to produce a
comprehensive, source-grounded outline linking to a memory bank of evidence.
The writer then executes a hierarchical retrieval and writing process,
composing the report section by section. By performing targeted retrieval of
only the necessary evidence from the memory bank for each part, it effectively
mitigates long-context issues. Our framework establishes a new state-of-the-art
across major OEDR benchmarks, including DeepResearch Bench, DeepConsult, and
DeepResearchGym. These results validate our human-centric, iterative
methodology, demonstrating that adaptive planning and focused synthesis are
crucial for producing high-quality, reliable, and well-structured reports.

TL;DR: ReSum是一种新的LLM网络代理范式，通过周期性上下文摘要实现无限探索，解决了ReAct等方法的上下文窗口限制问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于LLM的网络代理在处理知识密集型任务时表现良好，但受到上下文窗口限制的阻碍。复杂查询涉及多个实体、相互关联的关系和高不确定性，需要大量搜索周期，在达到完整解决方案之前迅速耗尽上下文预算。

Method: 引入ReSum范式，通过定期上下文摘要将不断增长的交互历史转换为紧凑的推理状态，保持对先前发现的感知同时绕过上下文约束。提出ReSum-GRPO，整合GRPO与分段轨迹训练和优势广播，使代理熟悉基于摘要的推理。

Result: 在三个基准测试中，ReSum相比ReAct平均绝对提升4.5%，经过ReSum-GRPO训练后进一步提升至8.2%。WebResummer-30B在BrowseComp-zh上达到33.3% Pass@1，在BrowseComp-en上达到18.3%，超越了现有开源网络代理。

Conclusion: ReSum通过上下文摘要机制有效解决了LLM网络代理的上下文限制问题，ReSum-GRPO训练进一步提升了性能，仅需1K训练样本就能显著超越现有方法。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based web agents demonstrate strong performance on
knowledge-intensive tasks but are hindered by context window limitations in
paradigms like ReAct. Complex queries involving multiple entities, intertwined
relationships, and high uncertainty demand extensive search cycles that rapidly
exhaust context budgets before reaching complete solutions. To overcome this
challenge, we introduce ReSum, a novel paradigm that enables indefinite
exploration through periodic context summarization. ReSum converts growing
interaction histories into compact reasoning states, maintaining awareness of
prior discoveries while bypassing context constraints. For paradigm adaptation,
we propose ReSum-GRPO, integrating GRPO with segmented trajectory training and
advantage broadcasting to familiarize agents with summary-conditioned
reasoning. Extensive experiments on web agents of varying scales across three
benchmarks demonstrate that ReSum delivers an average absolute improvement of
4.5\% over ReAct, with further gains of up to 8.2\% following ReSum-GRPO
training. Notably, with only 1K training samples, our WebResummer-30B (a
ReSum-GRPO-trained version of WebSailor-30B) achieves 33.3\% Pass@1 on
BrowseComp-zh and 18.3\% on BrowseComp-en, surpassing existing open-source web
agents.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究批判性评估了LLM激活解释方法，发现现有基准测试存在缺陷，解释结果更多反映了解释器LLM的参数知识而非目标模型的内部激活。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 验证激活解释方法是否能真正揭示目标LLM的内部工作机制，还是仅仅反映了输入信息或解释器LLM的固有知识。

Method: 在先前工作使用的数据集上评估流行解释方法，进行对照实验分析解释结果的信息来源。

Result: 解释方法在无需访问目标模型内部的情况下也能在基准测试中成功，解释结果往往反映了解释器LLM的参数知识而非目标模型的激活。

Conclusion: 需要更有针对性的基准测试和实验控制来严格评估解释方法是否能提供对LLM操作的有意义洞察。

Abstract: Recent interpretability methods have proposed to translate LLM internal
representations into natural language descriptions using a second verbalizer
LLM. This is intended to illuminate how the target model represents and
operates on inputs. But do such activation verbalization approaches actually
provide privileged knowledge about the internal workings of the target model,
or do they merely convey information about its inputs? We critically evaluate
popular verbalization methods across datasets used in prior work and find that
they succeed at benchmarks without any access to target model internals,
suggesting that these datasets are not ideal for evaluating verbalization
methods. We then run controlled experiments which reveal that verbalizations
often reflect the parametric knowledge of the verbalizer LLM which generated
them, rather than the activations of the target LLM being decoded. Taken
together, our results indicate a need for targeted benchmarks and experimental
controls to rigorously assess whether verbalization methods provide meaningful
insights into the operations of LLMs.

Abstract: Optimization-based decision support systems have a significant potential to
reduce delays, and thus improve efficiency on the railways, by automatically
re-routing and re-scheduling trains after delays have occurred. The operations
research community has dedicated a lot of effort to developing optimization
algorithms for this problem, but each study is typically tightly connected with
a specific industrial use case. Code and data are seldom shared publicly. This
fact hinders reproducibility, and has led to a proliferation of papers
describing algorithms for more or less compatible problem definitions, without
any real opportunity for readers to assess their relative performance. Inspired
by the successful communities around MILP, SAT, TSP, VRP, etc., we introduce a
common problem definition and file format, DISPLIB, which captures all the main
features of train re-routing and re-scheduling. We have gathered problem
instances from multiple real-world use cases and made them openly available. In
this paper, we describe the problem definition, the industrial instances, and a
reference solver implementation. This allows any researcher or developer to
work on the train dispatching problem without an industrial connection, and
enables the research community to perform empirical comparisons between
solvers. All materials are available online at https://displib.github.io.

Result: 实验结果表明HLSMAC能够有效评估多智能体的战略决策能力，为推进多智能体战略决策研究提供了强大的测试平台。

Conclusion: HLSMAC成功填补了MARL基准在高层战略评估方面的空白，为多智能体战略决策研究提供了新的方向和评估标准。

Abstract: Benchmarks are crucial for assessing multi-agent reinforcement learning
(MARL) algorithms. While StarCraft II-related environments have driven
significant advances in MARL, existing benchmarks like SMAC focus primarily on
micromanagement, limiting comprehensive evaluation of high-level strategic
intelligence. To address this, we introduce HLSMAC, a new cooperative MARL
benchmark with 12 carefully designed StarCraft II scenarios based on classical
stratagems from the Thirty-Six Stratagems. Each scenario corresponds to a
specific stratagem and is designed to challenge agents with diverse strategic
elements, including tactical maneuvering, timing coordination, and deception,
thereby opening up avenues for evaluating high-level strategic decision-making
capabilities. We also propose novel metrics across multiple dimensions beyond
conventional win rate, such as ability utilization and advancement efficiency,
to assess agents' overall performance within the HLSMAC environment. We
integrate state-of-the-art MARL algorithms and LLM-based agents with our
benchmark and conduct comprehensive experiments. The results demonstrate that
HLSMAC serves as a robust testbed for advancing multi-agent strategic
decision-making.

Method: 提出InPhyRe基准，使用算法生成的合成碰撞视频评估LMMs的归纳物理推理能力，测试模型在违反训练期间所见物理定律的场景下的表现。

Result: 对13个LMMs的评估显示：(1)LMMs难以将有限的参数知识应用于推理；(2)当演示样本违反物理定律时，归纳物理推理能力较弱；(3)LMMs存在语言偏见，很大程度上忽略视觉输入。

Conclusion: LMMs在视觉输入的信任度方面存在问题，归纳物理推理能力有限，需要改进以在安全关键应用中可靠地替代人类代理。

Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) encode universal physical laws observed during
training, such as momentum conservation, as parametric knowledge. It allows
LMMs to answer physical reasoning queries, such as the outcome of a potential
collision event from visual input. However, since parametric knowledge includes
only the physical laws seen during training, it is insufficient for reasoning
when the inference scenario violates these physical laws. In contrast, humans
possess the skill to adapt their physical reasoning to unseen physical
environments from a few visual examples. This ability, which we refer to as
inductive physical reasoning, is indispensable for LMMs if they are to replace
human agents in safety-critical applications. Despite its importance, existing
visual benchmarks evaluate only the parametric knowledge in LMMs, and not
inductive physical reasoning. To this end, we propose InPhyRe, the first visual
question answering benchmark to measure inductive physical reasoning in LMMs.
InPhyRe evaluates LMMs on their ability to predict the outcome of collision
events in algorithmically generated synthetic collision videos. By inspecting
13 LMMs, InPhyRe informs us that (1) LMMs struggle to apply their limited
parametric knowledge about universal physical laws to reasoning, (2) inductive
physical reasoning in LMMs is weak when demonstration samples violate universal
physical laws, and (3) inductive physical reasoning in LMMs suffers from
language bias and largely ignores the visual inputs, questioning the
trustworthiness of LMMs regarding visual inputs.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出LLMAP系统，结合LLM解析自然语言偏好和多步图搜索算法，解决多约束条件下的最优路线规划问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有路线规划方法存在局限：LLM直接规划难以处理大规模地图数据，图搜索方法对自然语言偏好理解能力有限，且全球用户时空分布高度异构不可预测

Method: 使用LLM-as-Parser解析自然语言、识别任务、提取用户偏好和任务依赖关系，结合多步图构建迭代搜索算法(MSGS)进行最优路线查找，采用多目标优化自适应调整权重

Result: 在14个国家27个城市的1000个路由提示上进行实验，结果显示该方法在多重约束下实现了优越性能并具有保证

Conclusion: LLMAP系统成功解决了自然语言驱动的路线规划中的关键挑战，在理解用户偏好和处理复杂约束方面表现出色

Abstract: The rise of large language models (LLMs) has made natural language-driven
route planning an emerging research area that encompasses rich user objectives.
Current research exhibits two distinct approaches: direct route planning using
LLM-as-Agent and graph-based searching strategies. However, LLMs in the former
approach struggle to handle extensive map data, while the latter shows limited
capability in understanding natural language preferences. Additionally, a more
critical challenge arises from the highly heterogeneous and unpredictable
spatio-temporal distribution of users across the globe. In this paper, we
introduce a novel LLM-Assisted route Planning (LLMAP) system that employs an
LLM-as-Parser to comprehend natural language, identify tasks, and extract user
preferences and recognize task dependencies, coupled with a Multi-Step Graph
construction with iterative Search (MSGS) algorithm as the underlying solver
for optimal route finding. Our multi-objective optimization approach adaptively
tunes objective weights to maximize points of interest (POI) quality and task
completion rate while minimizing route distance, subject to three key
constraints: user time limits, POI opening hours, and task dependencies. We
conduct extensive experiments using 1,000 routing prompts sampled with varying
complexity across 14 countries and 27 cities worldwide. The results demonstrate
that our approach achieves superior performance with guarantees across multiple
constraints.

Method: 开发了基于物联网的平台来高效控制环境条件，并使用VGG-19、InceptionResNetV2和InceptionV3算法构建AI病害检测框架分析定期拍摄的图像

Result: 物联网系统能持续在线发布温度、湿度、水流和储罐容量数据，并调整控制参数为植物提供最佳生长环境；VGG-19算法在病害检测中表现最佳，准确率达到92%

Abstract: Controlling environmental conditions and monitoring plant status in
greenhouses is critical to promptly making appropriate management decisions
aimed at promoting crop production. The primary objective of this research
study was to develop and test a smart aeroponic greenhouse on an experimental
scale where the status of Geranium plant and environmental conditions are
continuously monitored through the integration of the internet of things (IoT)
and artificial intelligence (AI). An IoT-based platform was developed to
control the environmental conditions of plants more efficiently and provide
insights to users to make informed management decisions. In addition, we
developed an AI-based disease detection framework using VGG-19,
InceptionResNetV2, and InceptionV3 algorithms to analyze the images captured
periodically after an intentional inoculation. The performance of the AI
framework was compared with an expert's evaluation of disease status.
Preliminary results showed that the IoT system implemented in the greenhouse
environment is able to publish data such as temperature, humidity, water flow,
and volume of charge tanks online continuously to users and adjust the
controlled parameters to provide an optimal growth environment for the plants.
Furthermore, the results of the AI framework demonstrate that the VGG-19
algorithm was able to identify drought stress and rust leaves from healthy
leaves with the highest accuracy, 92% among the other algorithms.

TL;DR: AIssistant是一个开源的、以人为中心的AI辅助科研框架，通过模块化工具和智能体简化科学工作流的端到端创建，提高起草效率和主题一致性，但仍需人类监督确保准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI辅助研究工具存在碎片化问题，缺乏以人为中心的工作流程，需要开发集成化的协作框架来简化科研工作流程。

Method: 开发AIssistant框架，集成文献综合、分段实验、引用管理和LaTeX论文生成等模块化工具，采用三层评估：独立人工评审、自动化LLM评审和程序主席监督。

Result: 系统提高了起草效率和主题一致性，但存在引用幻觉、动态论文结构适应性差和多模态内容整合不完整等局限性。

Conclusion: 人机协作对于保持事实正确性、方法合理性和伦理合规性仍然至关重要，AIssistant为科研工作流提供了有效但需要进一步完善的解决方案。

Abstract: Advances in AI-assisted research have introduced powerful tools for
literature retrieval, hypothesis generation, experimentation, and manuscript
preparation. However, systems remain fragmented and lack human-centred
workflows. To address these gaps, we introduce AIssistant, an agentic,
open-source Human-AI collaborative framework designed to simplify the
end-to-end creation of scientific workflows. Since our development is still in
an early stage, we present here the first experiments with AIssistant for
perspective and review research papers in machine learning. Our system
integrates modular tools and agents for literature synthesis, section-wise
experimentation, citation management, and automatic LaTeX paper text
generation, while maintaining human oversight at every stage to ensure
accuracy, coherence, and scholarly rigour. We conducted a comprehensive
evaluation across three layers: (1) Independent Human Review, following NeurIPS
double-blind standards; (2) Automated LLM Review, using GPT-5 as a scalable
human review proxy; and (3) Program Chair Oversight, where the chair monitors
the entire review process and makes final validation and acceptance decisions.
The results demonstrate that AIssistant improves drafting efficiency and
thematic consistency. Nonetheless, Human-AI collaboration remains essential for
maintaining factual correctness, methodological soundness, and ethical
compliance. Despite its effectiveness, we identify key limitations, including
hallucinated citations, difficulty adapting to dynamic paper structures, and
incomplete integration of multimodal content.

Motivation: 解决小型设备端模型在UI交互意图理解方面的困难，提供隐私保护、低成本和低延迟的用户体验

Method: 两阶段方法：1) 结构化交互摘要捕获每个用户动作的关键信息 2) 在聚合摘要上使用微调模型进行意图提取

Result: 该方法提升了资源受限模型的意图理解能力，甚至超越了大型多模态大语言模型的基准性能

Conclusion: 分解式方法能有效解决小型模型在UI交互意图理解方面的挑战，为设备端智能代理开发提供了可行的解决方案

Abstract: Understanding user intents from UI interaction trajectories remains a
challenging, yet crucial, frontier in intelligent agent development. While
massive, datacenter-based, multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) possess
greater capacity to handle the complexities of such sequences, smaller models
which can run on-device to provide a privacy-preserving, low-cost, and
low-latency user experience, struggle with accurate intent inference. We
address these limitations by introducing a novel decomposed approach: first, we
perform structured interaction summarization, capturing key information from
each user action. Second, we perform intent extraction using a fine-tuned model
operating on the aggregated summaries. This method improves intent
understanding in resource-constrained models, even surpassing the base
performance of large MLLMs.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个名为\sys的熵增强框架，用于在多轮工具辅助的代码生成任务中增强模型性能，通过保持策略熵和优化多轮交互，在SWE-bench基准测试中取得了最先进的结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM在软件工程任务中表现不佳，标准对齐方法如DPO和KTO虽然能对齐人类偏好，但会降低输出多样性，限制测试时扩展的效果。现有方法主要针对单轮任务，无法处理多轮推理和工具集成需求。

Method: 提出\sys框架，增强偏好目标以显式保持策略熵，将学习推广到优化多轮交互而非单轮响应。采用混合最佳轨迹选择方案，结合学习验证器模型和无模型方法。

Result: 在SWE-bench排行榜上，30B参数的\sys训练模型在open-weight模型中排名第一（lite）和第四（verified），仅被参数量超过10倍（>350B）的模型超越。

Conclusion: \sys框架成功解决了多轮工具辅助代码生成中的对齐与多样性平衡问题，显著提升了LLM在复杂软件工程任务中的性能表现。

Abstract: Software engineering presents complex, multi-step challenges for Large
Language Models (LLMs), requiring reasoning over large codebases and
coordinated tool use. The difficulty of these tasks is exemplified by
benchmarks like SWE-bench, where current LLMs still struggle to resolve
real-world issues.
  A promising approach to enhance performance is test-time scaling (TTS), but
its gains are heavily dependent on the diversity of model outputs.
  While standard alignment methods such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)
and Kahneman-Tversky Optimization (KTO) are effective at aligning model outputs
with human preferences, this process can come at the cost of reduced diversity,
limiting the effectiveness of TTS.
  Additionally, existing preference optimization algorithms are typically
designed for single-turn tasks and do not fully address the complexities of
multi-turn reasoning and tool integration required for interactive coding
agents.
  To bridge this gap, we introduce \sys, an entropy-enhanced framework that
adapts existing preference optimization algorithms to the multi-turn,
tool-assisted setting.
  \sys augments the preference objective to explicitly preserve policy entropy
and generalizes learning to optimize over multi-turn interactions rather than
single-turn responses.
  We validate \sys by fine-tuning a diverse suite of models from different
families and sizes (up to 106B parameters).
  To maximize performance gains from TTS, we further propose a hybrid
best-trajectory selection scheme combining a learned verifier model with model
free approaches.
  On the \swebench leaderboard, our approach establishes new state-of-the-art
results among open-weight models. A 30B parameter model trained with \sys ranks
1st on \lite and 4th on \verified on the open-weight leaderboard, surpassed
only by models with over 10x more parameters(\eg$>$350B).

Motivation: 解决世界模型部署中大小与性能的权衡问题 - 大模型计算资源需求高不适用于边缘设备，小模型物理建模精度不足导致预测效果差。

Method: 提出Physics-Informed BEV World Model (PIWM)，使用Soft Mask技术改进动态对象建模和未来预测，引入Warm Start推理技术提升零样本模型的预测质量。

Result: 在相同参数量(400M)下，PIWM比基线模型加权总分提升60.6%；最小PIWM模型(130M Soft Mask)比最大基线模型(400M)加权总分高7.4%，推理速度快28%。

Conclusion: PIWM通过创新的训练和推理技术，成功实现了小参数模型的高性能物理动力学建模，为边缘设备部署提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: A major challenge in deploying world models is the trade-off between size and
performance. Large world models can capture rich physical dynamics but require
massive computing resources, making them impractical for edge devices. Small
world models are easier to deploy but often struggle to learn accurate physics,
leading to poor predictions. We propose the Physics-Informed BEV World Model
(PIWM), a compact model designed to efficiently capture physical interactions
in bird's-eye-view (BEV) representations. PIWM uses Soft Mask during training
to improve dynamic object modeling and future prediction. We also introduce a
simple yet effective technique, Warm Start, for inference to enhance prediction
quality with a zero-shot model. Experiments show that at the same parameter
scale (400M), PIWM surpasses the baseline by 60.6% in weighted overall score.
Moreover, even when compared with the largest baseline model (400M), the
smallest PIWM (130M Soft Mask) achieves a 7.4% higher weighted overall score
with a 28% faster inference speed.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的神经网络剪枝技术在推理语言模型上会导致更大的性能损失，甚至可能使模型更慢，因为标准剪枝方法主要关注输入重构，而推理任务是解码主导的

Method: 提出RAC方法，在剪枝过程中联合重构输入和模型在策略思维链轨迹的激活，该方法可无缝集成到现有剪枝工作流如SparseGPT中

Result: RAC方法显著提升了剪枝技术的性能，解决了传统剪枝方法在推理任务上的局限性

Conclusion: RAC是一种简单有效的drop-in修复方案，通过考虑推理任务特性来改进模型压缩，在保持推理能力的同时实现高效部署

Abstract: Reasoning language models such as DeepSeek-R1 produce long chain-of-thought
traces during inference time which make them costly to deploy at scale. We show
that using compression techniques such as neural network pruning produces
greater performance loss than in typical language modeling tasks, and in some
cases can make the model slower since they cause the model to produce more
thinking tokens but with worse performance. We show that this is partly due to
the fact that standard LLM pruning methods often focus on input reconstruction,
whereas reasoning is a decode-dominated task. We introduce a simple, drop-in
fix: during pruning we jointly reconstruct activations from the input and the
model's on-policy chain-of-thought traces. This "Reasoning-Aware Compression"
(RAC) integrates seamlessly into existing pruning workflows such as SparseGPT,
and boosts their performance significantly. Code reproducing the results in the
paper can be found at: https://github.com/RyanLucas3/RAC

In a randomized trial to evaluate its effectiveness, PowerGPT significantly
improved task completion rates (99.3% vs. 88.9% for test selection, 99.3% vs.
77.8% for sample size calculation) and accuracy (94.1% vs. 55.4% in sample size
estimation, p < 0.001), while reducing average completion time (4.0 vs. 9.3
minutes, p < 0.001). These gains were consistent across various statistical

bridging expertise gaps. Already under deployment across multiple institutions,
PowerGPT represents a scalable AI-driven approach that enhances accessibility,

Abstract: Cognitive science and theoretical computer science both seek to classify and
explain the difficulty of tasks. Mechanisms of intelligence are those that
reduce task difficulty. Here we map concepts from the computational complexity
of a physical puzzle, the Soma Cube, onto cognitive problem-solving strategies
through a ``Principle of Materiality''. By analyzing the puzzle's branching
factor, measured through search tree outdegree, we quantitatively assess task
difficulty and systematically examine how different strategies modify
complexity. We incrementally refine a trial-and-error search by layering
preprocessing (cognitive chunking), value ordering (cognitive free-sorting),
variable ordering (cognitive scaffolding), and pruning (cognitive inference).
We discuss how the competent use of artifacts reduces effective time complexity
by exploiting physical constraints and propose a model of intelligence as a
library of algorithms that recruit the capabilities of both mind and matter.

Motivation: 环岛虽然减少了严重事故，但风险模式因条件而异，需要可解释的分析方法来理解不同条件下的事故机制和严重性驱动因素。

Method: 采用两步骤可解释工作流：首先使用聚类对应分析(CCA)识别共现因素并得出四种事故模式，然后使用基于树的严重性模型并通过SHAP进行解释，量化模式内和跨模式的伤害驱动因素。

Result: 研究发现黑暗、湿滑路面和较高限速条件下与固定物体或角度碰撞事件同时发生时事故严重性更高，而在清晰、低速设置下事故严重性较低。模式特定解释突出了入口处(未能让行、间隙接受)、多车道循环内(不当操作)和减速期间(追尾)的机制。

Conclusion: 该工作流将模式发现与案例级解释联系起来，支持场地筛选、对策选择和审计就绪报告，为公共安全分析提供了实用的可解释人工智能模板。

Abstract: Roundabouts reduce severe crashes, yet risk patterns vary by conditions. This
study analyzes 2017-2021 Ohio roundabout crashes using a two-step, explainable
workflow. Cluster Correspondence Analysis (CCA) identifies co-occurring factors
and yields four crash patterns. A tree-based severity model is then interpreted
with SHAP to quantify drivers of injury within and across patterns. Results
show higher severity when darkness, wet surfaces, and higher posted speeds
coincide with fixed-object or angle events, and lower severity in clear,
low-speed settings. Pattern-specific explanations highlight mechanisms at
entries (fail-to-yield, gap acceptance), within multi-lane circulation
(improper maneuvers), and during slow-downs (rear-end). The workflow links
pattern discovery with case-level explanations, supporting site screening,
countermeasure selection, and audit-ready reporting. The contribution to
Information Systems is a practical template for usable XAI in public safety
analytics.

Abstract: Despite advances in AI for contact centers, customer experience (CX)
continues to suffer from high average handling time (AHT), low first-call
resolution, and poor customer satisfaction (CSAT). A key driver is the
cognitive load on agents, who must navigate fragmented systems, troubleshoot
manually, and frequently place customers on hold. Existing AI-powered
agent-assist tools are often reactive driven by static rules, simple prompting,
or retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) without deeper contextual reasoning. We
introduce Agentic AI goal-driven, autonomous, tool-using systems that
proactively support agents in real time. Unlike conventional approaches,
Agentic AI identifies customer intent, triggers modular workflows, maintains
evolving context, and adapts dynamically to conversation state. This paper
presents a case study of Minerva CQ, a real-time Agent Assist product deployed
in voice-based customer support. Minerva CQ integrates real-time transcription,
intent and sentiment detection, entity recognition, contextual retrieval,
dynamic customer profiling, and partial conversational summaries enabling
proactive workflows and continuous context-building. Deployed in live

Abstract: We present Match Chat, a real-time, agent-driven assistant designed to
enhance the tennis fan experience by delivering instant, accurate responses to
match-related queries. Match Chat integrates Generative Artificial Intelligence
(GenAI) with Generative Computing (GenComp) techniques to synthesize key
insights during live tennis singles matches. The system debuted at the 2025
Wimbledon Championships and the 2025 US Open, where it provided about 1 million
users with seamless access to streaming and static data through natural
language queries. The architecture is grounded in an Agent-Oriented
Architecture (AOA) combining rule engines, predictive models, and agents to
pre-process and optimize user queries before passing them to GenAI components.
The Match Chat system had an answer accuracy of 92.83% with an average response
time of 6.25 seconds under loads of up to 120 requests per second (RPS). Over
96.08% of all queries were guided using interactive prompt design, contributing
to a user experience that prioritized clarity, responsiveness, and minimal
effort. The system was designed to mask architectural complexity, offering a
frictionless and intuitive interface that required no onboarding or technical
familiarity. Across both Grand Slam deployments, Match Chat maintained 100%
uptime and supported nearly 1 million unique users, underscoring the
scalability and reliability of the platform. This work introduces key design
patterns for real-time, consumer-facing AI systems that emphasize speed,
precision, and usability that highlights a practical path for deploying
performant agentic systems in dynamic environments.

*Minyu Chen,Guoqiang Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DaSAThco是一个使用大语言模型生成多样化启发式集成组合，并通过自适应选择机制实现从实例特征到定制化启发式集成的通用映射框架，解决了SAT求解器配置泛化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAT问题的异质性使得单一最优配置无法实现，而现有的数据集特定方法缺乏泛化性且需要对新问题类型进行昂贵的重新优化。

Method: 使用大语言模型在系统定义的问题原型指导下生成多样化的专门启发式集成组合，然后学习自适应选择机制形成最终的映射关系。

Result: 实验表明DaSAThco实现了优越的性能，特别是在非自适应方法表现有限的领域外泛化方面表现出强大的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 这项工作为复杂可配置系统的自动化算法设计建立了更可扩展和实用的路径。

Abstract: The performance of Conflict-Driven Clause Learning solvers hinges on internal
heuristics, yet the heterogeneity of SAT problems makes a single, universally
optimal configuration unattainable. While prior automated methods can find
specialized configurations for specific problem families, this dataset-specific
approach lacks generalizability and requires costly re-optimization for new
problem types. We introduce DaSAThco, a framework that addresses this challenge
by learning a generalizable mapping from instance features to tailored
heuristic ensembles, enabling a train-once, adapt-broadly model. Our framework
uses a Large Language Model, guided by systematically defined Problem
Archetypes, to generate a diverse portfolio of specialized heuristic ensembles
and subsequently learns an adaptive selection mechanism to form the final
mapping. Experiments show that DaSAThco achieves superior performance and, most
notably, demonstrates robust out-of-domain generalization where non-adaptive
methods show limitations. Our work establishes a more scalable and practical
path toward automated algorithm design for complex, configurable systems.

TL;DR: 提出了AD-FCoT框架，通过类比推理和思维链提示相结合的方式，在无需额外训练的情况下提升金融新闻情感分析的准确性和可解释性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以捕捉金融新闻的复杂经济背景且缺乏透明推理，影响了可靠性。大语言模型虽具备强大文本理解能力，但在金融情感分析中仍有改进空间

Method: AD-FCoT提示框架，引导大语言模型在新事件和相关历史情景之间建立类比，并将这些类比嵌入结构化的逐步推理链中，无需额外训练数据或微调

Result: 在数千篇新闻文章上的实验显示，AD-FCoT在情感分类准确性和与市场回报的相关性方面均优于强基线方法，生成的解释与领域专业知识一致

Conclusion: AD-FCoT是首批在金融领域明确将类比示例与思维链推理相结合的方法之一，为实际金融分析提供了可解释的见解，具有实际应用价值

Abstract: Financial news sentiment analysis is crucial for anticipating market
movements. With the rise of AI techniques such as Large Language Models (LLMs),
which demonstrate strong text understanding capabilities, there has been
renewed interest in enhancing these systems. Existing methods, however, often
struggle to capture the complex economic context of news and lack transparent
reasoning, which undermines their reliability. We propose Analogy-Driven
Financial Chain-of-Thought (AD-FCoT), a prompting framework that integrates
analogical reasoning with chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting for sentiment
prediction on historical financial news. AD-FCoT guides LLMs to draw parallels
between new events and relevant historical scenarios with known outcomes,
embedding these analogies into a structured, step-by-step reasoning chain. To
our knowledge, this is among the first approaches to explicitly combine
analogical examples with CoT reasoning in finance. Operating purely through
prompting, AD-FCoT requires no additional training data or fine-tuning and
leverages the model's internal financial knowledge to generate rationales that
mirror human analytical reasoning. Experiments on thousands of news articles
show that AD-FCoT outperforms strong baselines in sentiment classification
accuracy and achieves substantially higher correlation with market returns. Its
generated explanations also align with domain expertise, providing
interpretable insights suitable for real-world financial analysis.

Motivation: 解决Text2SQL生成中语法正确但语义误解用户意图的问题，同时发现当前基准测试数据质量差的问题

Method: 提出GBV-SQL多代理框架，引入SQL2Text反向翻译验证机制，通过专门代理将生成的SQL翻译回自然语言来验证逻辑一致性

Result: 在BIRD基准上达到63.23%执行准确率（提升5.8%），在去除错误样本后，在Spider基准上达到96.5%（开发集）和97.6%（测试集）的执行准确率

Conclusion: 该工作不仅提供了语义验证的鲁棒框架，还批判性地指出了基准测试完整性问题，强调了更严格数据集管理的必要性

Abstract: While Large Language Models have significantly advanced Text2SQL generation,
a critical semantic gap persists where syntactically valid queries often
misinterpret user intent. To mitigate this challenge, we propose GBV-SQL, a
novel multi-agent framework that introduces Guided Generation with SQL2Text
Back-translation Validation. This mechanism uses a specialized agent to
translate the generated SQL back into natural language, which verifies its
logical alignment with the original question. Critically, our investigation
reveals that current evaluation is undermined by a systemic issue: the poor
quality of the benchmarks themselves. We introduce a formal typology for "Gold
Errors", which are pervasive flaws in the ground-truth data, and demonstrate
how they obscure true model performance. On the challenging BIRD benchmark,
GBV-SQL achieves 63.23% execution accuracy, a 5.8% absolute improvement. After
removing flawed examples, GBV-SQL achieves 96.5% (dev) and 97.6% (test)
execution accuracy on the Spider benchmark. Our work offers both a robust
framework for semantic validation and a critical perspective on benchmark
integrity, highlighting the need for more rigorous dataset curation.

Motivation: 预测牛群增重有助于大型养殖场优化饲养策略、做出明智育种选择，并降低气候变异和市场波动的风险

Method: 使用随机森林（RF）模型，并与支持向量回归（SVR）和长短期记忆（LSTM）模型进行比较，利用756个样本数据和天气数据（降雨和温度）进行预测

Result: RF模型在所有数据集上表现最佳，当包含天气和年龄因素时达到R²=0.973、RMSE=0.040和MAE=0.033，显著优于其他模型

Conclusion: RF模型是预测牛群增重的强大工具，天气和年龄因素对预测准确性有重要影响，研究还开发了自动化预处理工具并公开在GitHub上

Abstract: Forecasting mob based cattle weight gain (MB CWG) may benefit large livestock
farms, allowing farmers to refine their feeding strategies, make educated
breeding choices, and reduce risks linked to climate variability and market
fluctuations. In this paper, a novel technique termed MB CWG is proposed to
forecast the one month advanced weight gain of herd based cattle using
historical data collected from the Charles Sturt University Farm. This research
employs a Random Forest (RF) model, comparing its performance against Support
Vector Regression (SVR) and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) models for monthly
weight gain prediction. Four datasets were used to evaluate the performance of
models, using 756 sample data from 108 herd-based cattle, along with weather
data (rainfall and temperature) influencing CWG. The RF model performs better
than the SVR and LSTM models across all datasets, achieving an R^2 of 0.973,
RMSE of 0.040, and MAE of 0.033 when both weather and age factors were
included. The results indicate that including both weather and age factors
significantly improves the accuracy of weight gain predictions, with the RF
model outperforming the SVR and LSTM models in all scenarios. These findings
demonstrate the potential of RF as a robust tool for forecasting cattle weight
gain in variable conditions, highlighting the influence of age and climatic
factors on herd based weight trends. This study has also developed an
innovative automated pre processing tool to generate a benchmark dataset for MB
CWG predictive models. The tool is publicly available on GitHub and can assist
in preparing datasets for current and future analytical research..

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ECG-aBcDe是一种新颖的心电图编码方法，将ECG信号转换为通用ECG语言，使任何大型语言模型都能直接分析心电图，解决了现有方法的可迁移性、时间尺度信息学习和可解释性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前ECG分析方法存在模型特定的编码器阻碍跨LLM迁移、Transformer难以捕捉ECG关键时间尺度信息、以及黑盒性质限制临床应用等问题，需要一种通用的ECG表示方法。

Method: 提出ECG-aBcDe编码方法，将ECG信号转换为通用ECG语言，构建ECG语言和自然语言的混合数据集，无需修改架构即可直接微调预训练LLM，并支持双向转换以提取注意力热图。

Result: 在ROUGE-L和METEOR指标上达到竞争性性能，BLEU-4指标显著提升：数据集内评估提升2.8倍（42.58分），跨数据集评估提升3.9倍（30.76分）。

Conclusion: ECG-aBcDe为ECG分析与LLM集成提供了新范式，证明了该方法的可行性，显著提升了性能指标和可解释性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) hold significant promise for electrocardiogram
(ECG) analysis, yet challenges remain regarding transferability, time-scale
information learning, and interpretability. Current methods suffer from
model-specific ECG encoders, hindering transfer across LLMs. Furthermore, LLMs
struggle to capture crucial time-scale information inherent in ECGs due to
Transformer limitations. And their black-box nature limits clinical adoption.
To address these limitations, we introduce ECG-aBcDe, a novel ECG encoding
method that transforms ECG signals into a universal ECG language readily
interpretable by any LLM. By constructing a hybrid dataset of ECG language and
natural language, ECG-aBcDe enables direct fine-tuning of pre-trained LLMs
without architectural modifications, achieving "construct once, use anywhere"
capability. Moreover, the bidirectional convertibility between ECG and ECG
language of ECG-aBcDe allows for extracting attention heatmaps from ECG
signals, significantly enhancing interpretability. Finally, ECG-aBcDe
explicitly represents time-scale information, mitigating Transformer
limitations. This work presents a new paradigm for integrating ECG analysis
with LLMs. Compared with existing methods, our method achieves competitive
performance on ROUGE-L and METEOR. Notably, it delivers significant
improvements in the BLEU-4, with improvements of 2.8 times and 3.9 times in
in-dataset and cross-dataset evaluations, respectively, reaching scores of
42.58 and 30.76. These results provide strong evidence for the feasibility of
the new paradigm.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AutoCO是一种端到端的自动化约束优化方法，利用大型语言模型生成约束松弛策略，结合进化算法和蒙特卡洛树搜索的双向协同进化机制，有效解决非线性组合优化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 非线性组合优化问题(NCOPs)具有多模态解空间，传统约束松弛方法依赖专家经验且缺乏系统自动化。现有LLM方法主要作为被动约束验证器，无法处理NCOPs中复杂的约束交互。

Method: 利用结构化LLM推理生成约束松弛策略，通过统一的三重表示方案动态演化算法原理和可执行代码。建立双向(全局-局部)协同进化机制，结合进化算法进行局部优化和蒙特卡洛树搜索进行全局策略空间探索。

Result: 在三个具有挑战性的NCOP基准测试上的综合实验验证了AutoCO的一致有效性和优于基线的性能表现。

Conclusion: AutoCO通过LLM学习松弛约束的方法革新了NCOPs的解决方式，在碎片化解空间中实现了强化和多样化的最优平衡。

Abstract: Nonlinear Combinatorial Optimization Problems (NCOPs) present a formidable
computational hurdle in practice, as their nonconvex nature gives rise to
multi-modal solution spaces that defy efficient optimization. Traditional
constraint relaxation approaches rely heavily on expert-driven, iterative
design processes that lack systematic automation and scalable adaptability.
While recent Large Language Model (LLM)-based optimization methods show promise
for autonomous problem-solving, they predominantly function as passive
constraint validators rather than proactive strategy architects, failing to
handle the sophisticated constraint interactions inherent to NCOPs.To address
these limitations, we introduce the first end-to-end \textbf{Auto}mated
\textbf{C}onstraint \textbf{O}ptimization (AutoCO) method, which revolutionizes
NCOPs resolution through learning to relax with LLMs.Specifically, we leverage
structured LLM reasoning to generate constraint relaxation strategies, which
are dynamically evolving with algorithmic principles and executable code
through a unified triple-representation scheme. We further establish a novel
bidirectional (global-local) coevolution mechanism that synergistically
integrates Evolutionary Algorithms for intensive local refinement with Monte
Carlo Tree Search for systematic global strategy space exploration, ensuring
optimal balance between intensification and diversification in fragmented
solution spaces. Finally, comprehensive experiments on three challenging NCOP
benchmarks validate AutoCO's consistent effectiveness and superior performance
over the baselines.

Motivation: 评估大语言模型随时间推移的推理能力变化，并探索更高效的推理方法以减少计算成本。

Method: 使用PrOntoQA数据集的真假问题测试三个领先模型，采用隐藏思维链提示和思维模型技术，并开发神经符号架构将问题转换为标准化形式后用Z3求解器处理。

Result: 从2023年到2024年性能提升归因于思维链提示，2024年到2025年思维模型带来显著改进。神经符号方法在保持近乎完美性能的同时显著降低计算成本。

Conclusion: 大语言模型的推理能力随时间持续提升，神经符号架构是降低推理计算成本的有效方法，FLOPs估算公式在实际应用中准确度较高。

Abstract: We present a longitudinal study which evaluates the reasoning capability of
frontier Large Language Models over an eighteen month period. We measured the
accuracy of three leading models from December 2023, September 2024 and June
2025 on true or false questions from the PrOntoQA dataset and their
faithfulness to reasoning strategies provided through in-context learning. The
improvement in performance from 2023 to 2024 can be attributed to hidden Chain
of Thought prompting. The introduction of thinking models allowed for
significant improvement in model performance between 2024 and 2025.
  We then present a neuro-symbolic architecture which uses LLMs of less than 15
billion parameters to translate the problems into a standardised form. We then
parse the standardised forms of the problems into a program to be solved by Z3,
an SMT solver, to determine the satisfiability of the query. We report the
number of prompt and completion tokens as well as the computational cost in
FLOPs for open source models. The neuro-symbolic approach significantly reduces
the computational cost while maintaining near perfect performance. The common
approximation that the number of inference FLOPs is double the product of the
active parameters and total tokens was accurate within 10\% for all
experiments.

Motivation: 现有方法需要大量微调或依赖预定义算法，存在局限性。GRRAF旨在通过结合RAG和LLM的代码生成能力，提供一种更灵活、高效的图推理解决方案。

Method: 将目标图存储在图形数据库中，提示LLM生成可执行代码查询来检索必要信息，包含错误反馈循环和超时机制确保正确性和效率。

Result: 在GraphInstruct数据集上，大多数图推理任务达到100%准确率（包括环检测、二分图检查、最短路径计算和最大流），子图匹配性能也很高，能有效扩展到10,000个节点的大图。

Conclusion: GRRAF提供了一种训练自由的图推理方法，通过代码生成和检索增强的结合，在保持高准确性的同时实现了良好的可扩展性，为图推理任务提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: We propose a new, training-free method, Graph Reasoning via Retrieval
Augmented Framework (GRRAF), that harnesses retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG) alongside the code-generation capabilities of large language models
(LLMs) to address a wide range of graph reasoning tasks. In GRRAF, the target
graph is stored in a graph database, and the LLM is prompted to generate
executable code queries that retrieve the necessary information. This approach
circumvents the limitations of existing methods that require extensive
finetuning or depend on predefined algorithms, and it incorporates an error
feedback loop with a time-out mechanism to ensure both correctness and
efficiency. Experimental evaluations on the GraphInstruct dataset reveal that
GRRAF achieves 100% accuracy on most graph reasoning tasks, including cycle
detection, bipartite graph checks, shortest path computation, and maximum flow,
while maintaining consistent token costs regardless of graph sizes. Imperfect
but still very high performance is observed on subgraph matching. Notably,
GRRAF scales effectively to large graphs with up to 10,000 nodes.

Method: 提出分层记忆架构，将记忆分为高级规划记忆和低级执行记忆；引入H²R机制从过去的智能体-环境交互中提炼可重用的分层知识；在测试时分别检索高低级记忆。

Result: 在两个基准测试上的实验结果表明，H²R能够提高泛化能力和决策性能，优于Expel等现有基线方法。

Conclusion: 分层记忆架构和H²R机制有效解决了现有知识迁移方法的局限性，为LLM智能体在多任务场景中的知识重用提供了更精细和高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-based agents have shown strong potential in
multi-task scenarios, owing to their ability to transfer knowledge across
diverse tasks. However, existing approaches often treat prior experiences and
knowledge as monolithic units, leading to inefficient and coarse-grained
knowledge transfer. In this work, we propose a novel hierarchical memory
architecture that enables fine-grained knowledge transfer by decoupling
high-level planning memory from low-level execution memory. To construct and
refine these hierarchical memories, we introduce Hierarchical Hindsight
Reflection (H$^2$R), a mechanism that distills reusable and hierarchical
knowledge from past agent-environment interactions. At test time, H$^2$R
performs retrievals of high-level and low-level memories separately, allowing
LLM-based agents to efficiently access and utilize task-relevant knowledge for
new tasks.Experimental results across two benchmarks demonstrate that H$^2$R
can improve generalization and decision-making performance, outperforming prior
baselines such as Expel.

Motivation: 现有方法如Coconut和SoftCoT在连续潜在空间推理中有效，但高质量潜在思维的高效生成和利用仍是核心瓶颈。基于SoftCoT++理论，更大的潜在思维分布方差能更好逼近真实分布。

Method: 1) 基于可学习先验的潜在思维生成架构，提高生成向量的分布方差；2) 基于分布的方向性优化范式，联合约束分布局部性和规模，结合SFT损失、语义对齐损失（KL散度）和推理聚焦损失（对比学习）的多目标协同训练策略。

Conclusion: LTA-Thinker通过增强潜在思维分布的方差和引入多目标优化策略，有效提升了大语言模型的复杂推理能力，为动态优化推理过程提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Complex Reasoning in Large Language Models can be dynamically optimized using
Test-Time Scaling (TTS) to mitigate Overthinking. Methods such as Coconut,
SoftCoT and its variant are effective in continuous latent space inference, the
core bottleneck still lies in the efficient generation and utilization of
high-quality Latent Thought. Drawing from the theory of SoftCoT++ that a larger
variance in the generated Latent Thought distribution more closely approximates
the golden truth distribution, we propose a Latent Thought-Augmented Training
Framework--LTA-Thinker, which improves distributional variance and enhances
reasoning performance from two perspectives. First, LTA-Thinker constructs a
Latent Thought generation architecture based on a learnable prior. This
architecture aims to increase the variance distribution of generated Latent
Thought Vectors in order to simplify the overall structure and raise the
performance ceiling. Second, LTA-Thinker introduces a distribution-based
directional optimization paradigm that jointly constrains both distribution
locality and distribution scale. This mechanism improves information efficiency
and computational cost through a multi-objective co-training strategy, which
combines standard Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) loss with two novel losses:
Semantic Alignment Loss, which utilizes KL divergence to ensure that the Latent
Thought is highly relevant to the semantics of the question; Reasoning Focus
Loss, which utilizes a contrastive learning mechanism to guide the model to
focus on the most critical reasoning steps. Experiments show that LTA-thinker
achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance among various baselines and
demonstrates a higher performance ceiling and better scaling effects.

are expensive, time-consuming and also heavily dependent on human resources,
requiring significant manpower for data collection and processing. In this
study a deep learning solution is proposed to estimate population using high

Result: FSRL在偏好优化方面与当前RLHF方法效果相当，机制分析发现适配器策略系统性地促进风格特征而非明确对齐概念，表明偏好优化过程将风格呈现作为质量的代理进行奖励。

Conclusion: FSRL为可解释模型控制和诊断对齐机制提供了工具，揭示了偏好优化过程中风格特征的重要性。

Abstract: Aligning large language models is critical for their usability and safety.
However, the prevailing approach of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback
(RLHF) induces diffuse, opaque parameter changes, making it difficult to
discern what the model has internalized. Hence, we introduce Feature Steering
with Reinforcement Learning (FSRL), a transparent alignment framework that
trains a lightweight adapter to steer behavior by modulating interpretable
features from a Sparse Autoencoder (SAE). First, we demonstrate that FSRL is an
effective method for preference optimization and is comparable with current
RLHF methods. We then perform mechanistic analysis on the trained adapter, and
find that its policy systematically promotes style features over explicit
alignment concepts, suggesting that the preference optimization process rewards
stylistic presentation as a proxy for quality. Ultimately, we hope that FSRL
provides a tool for both interpretable model control and diagnosing the
internal mechanisms of alignment.

TL;DR: 提出Evo-Merging方法，通过进化算法实现黑盒大语言模型的合并，仅需推理API查询，无需访问模型权重


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型合并方法需要访问模型参数，但对于GPT-4等仅通过API提供的黑盒大模型，参数不可用，需要解决黑盒模型合并的挑战

Method: 基于进化算法的无导数优化框架，包含稀疏性去噪和符号感知缩放两个关键组件，通过API查询进行模型合并

Result: 在多个任务上达到最先进性能，显著优于现有基线方法

Conclusion: Evo-Merging方法有效解决了黑盒大语言模型合并问题，为无法访问模型参数的情况提供了实用解决方案

Abstract: Model merging refers to the process of integrating multiple distinct models
into a unified model that preserves and combines the strengths and capabilities
of the individual models. Most existing approaches rely on task vectors to
combine models, typically under the assumption that model parameters are
accessible. However, for extremely large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4,
which are often provided solely as black-box services through API interfaces
(Language-Model-as-a-Service), model weights are not available to end users.
This presents a significant challenge, which we refer to as black-box model
merging (BMM) with massive LLMs. To address this challenge, we propose a
derivative-free optimization framework based on the evolutionary algorithm
(Evo-Merging) that enables effective model merging using only inference-time
API queries. Our method consists of two key components: (1) sparsity-based
denoising, designed to identify and filter out irrelevant or redundant
information across models, and (2) sign-aware scaling, which dynamically
computes optimal combination weights for the relevant models based on their
performance. We also provide a formal justification, along with a theoretical
analysis, for our asymmetric sparsification. Extensive experimental evaluations
demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on a range of
tasks, significantly outperforming existing strong baselines.

TL;DR: 提出隐私增强的持续学习框架PeCL，通过动态差分隐私和隐私引导的记忆雕刻，在保护敏感信息的同时保持模型性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统持续学习模型面临严重的隐私挑战，统一的差分隐私预算会导致模型性能显著下降，阻碍在隐私敏感领域的部署

Method: 1. 基于语义敏感性的token级动态差分隐私策略，自适应分配隐私预算；2. 隐私引导的记忆雕刻模块，智能遗忘敏感信息同时保留任务不变的历史知识

Result: 实验表明PeCL在隐私保护和模型效用之间取得优越平衡，在保持先前任务高精度的同时确保强大的隐私保护

Conclusion: PeCL框架有效解决了持续学习中的隐私-效用权衡问题，为隐私敏感场景下的持续学习部署提供了可行方案

Abstract: Continual Learning (CL) models, while adept at sequential knowledge
acquisition, face significant and often overlooked privacy challenges due to
accumulating diverse information. Traditional privacy methods, like a uniform
Differential Privacy (DP) budget, indiscriminately protect all data, leading to
substantial model utility degradation and hindering CL deployment in
privacy-sensitive areas. To overcome this, we propose a privacy-enhanced
continual learning (PeCL) framework that forgets what's sensitive and remembers
what matters. Our approach first introduces a token-level dynamic Differential
Privacy strategy that adaptively allocates privacy budgets based on the
semantic sensitivity of individual tokens. This ensures robust protection for
private entities while minimizing noise injection for non-sensitive, general
knowledge. Second, we integrate a privacy-guided memory sculpting module. This
module leverages the sensitivity analysis from our dynamic DP mechanism to
intelligently forget sensitive information from the model's memory and
parameters, while explicitly preserving the task-invariant historical knowledge
crucial for mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Extensive experiments show that
PeCL achieves a superior balance between privacy preserving and model utility,
outperforming baseline models by maintaining high accuracy on previous tasks
while ensuring robust privacy.

TL;DR: Planning Copilot是一个通过自然语言指令调用多种规划工具的聊天机器人，利用MCP协议连接LLM与外部工具，显著提升了LLM在长期规划任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在自主执行复杂任务时缺乏可靠的长期规划能力，需要一种方法来弥补这一缺陷。

Method: 开发Planning Copilot系统，集成多种规划工具，通过Model Context Protocol(MCP)标准连接LLM与外部工具，支持语法检查、规划器选择、计划验证和执行模拟等任务。

Result: 实验表明Planning Copilot在使用三个开源LLM时表现远超无规划工具的相同LLM，在有限定性比较中甚至显著优于最新的GPT-5模型。

Conclusion: 专用规划工具可能是使LLM有效执行规划任务的有效途径，MCP协议为LLM与外部工具集成提供了标准化解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being used as autonomous agents
capable of performing complicated tasks. However, they lack the ability to
perform reliable long-horizon planning on their own. This paper bridges this
gap by introducing the Planning Copilot, a chatbot that integrates multiple
planning tools and allows users to invoke them through instructions in natural
language. The Planning Copilot leverages the Model Context Protocol (MCP), a
recently developed standard for connecting LLMs with external tools and
systems. This approach allows using any LLM that supports MCP without
domain-specific fine-tuning. Our Planning Copilot supports common planning
tasks such as checking the syntax of planning problems, selecting an
appropriate planner, calling it, validating the plan it generates, and
simulating their execution. We empirically evaluate the ability of our Planning
Copilot to perform these tasks using three open-source LLMs. The results show
that the Planning Copilot highly outperforms using the same LLMs without the
planning tools. We also conducted a limited qualitative comparison of our tool
against Chat GPT-5, a very recent commercial LLM. Our results shows that our
Planning Copilot significantly outperforms GPT-5 despite relying on a much
smaller LLM. This suggests dedicated planning tools may be an effective way to
enable LLMs to perform planning tasks.

Motivation: 验证安娜·卡列尼娜原则及其变体在不同类型文本结构中的适用性，探索成功与失败的结构模式差异

Method: 将文本表示为功能块序列，通过转换顺序和位置评估收敛性，分析小说、在线百科全书、研究论文和电影的结构模式

Result: 不同媒介遵循不同结构原则：小说顺序上遵循反向AKP，维基百科结合AKP和有序模式，学术论文顺序反向AKP但位置噪声大，电影按类型分化

Conclusion: 成功取决于媒介特定的结构约束，而失败在不同领域呈现不同形态

Abstract: The Anna Karenina Principle (AKP) holds that success requires satisfying a
small set of essential conditions, whereas failure takes diverse forms. We test
AKP, its reverse, and two further patterns described as ordered and noisy
across novels, online encyclopedias, research papers, and movies. Texts are
represented as sequences of functional blocks, and convergence is assessed in
transition order and position. Results show that structural principles vary by
medium: novels follow reverse AKP in order, Wikipedia combines AKP with ordered
patterns, academic papers display reverse AKP in order but remain noisy in
position, and movies diverge by genre. Success therefore depends on structural
constraints that are specific to each medium, while failure assumes different
shapes across domains.

Conclusion: MiniAgentPro提供了一个有效的平台来系统评估LLM代理在物理环境中的事件组织和协调能力，揭示了当前模型在复杂协调任务中的局限性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized the simulation of agent
societies, enabling autonomous planning, memory formation, and social
interactions. However, existing frameworks often overlook systematic

platform featuring an intuitive map editor for customizing environments and a
simulation player with smooth animations. Based on this tool, we introduce a
comprehensive test set comprising eight diverse event scenarios with basic and
hard variants to assess agents' ability. Evaluations using GPT-4o demonstrate
strong performance in basic settings but highlight coordination challenges in
hard variants.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个包含369个大学录取问题实例的新基准，用于评估大语言模型在匹配问题中的表现，发现LLMs在满足所有评估标准方面存在困难，推理模型表现优于传统模型，不同提示策略效果各异，迭代提示性能非单调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大语言模型在数学推理任务上表现出色，但在需要偏好和结构约束的匹配问题中的应用仍未被充分探索，因此需要建立一个专门的基准来评估LLMs在这类问题上的性能。

Method: 创建了包含369个大学录取问题实例的基准，评估多个开源LLMs在可行性、稳定性和最优性三个维度上的表现，测试了包括思维链、上下文学习和基于角色的提示等多种提示策略。

Result: LLMs能够满足某些约束但难以一致满足所有评估标准；推理模型（如QwQ和GPT-oss）显著优于传统模型；不同提示策略效果差异明显且无一致最优策略；迭代提示性能呈现非单调变化。

Conclusion: 该研究为模型推理性能和提示策略在具有偏好约束的组合优化问题中的有效性提供了新的视角，揭示了LLMs在匹配问题中的局限性以及提示策略选择的重要性。

Abstract: Recent advances in reasoning with large language models (LLMs) have
demonstrated strong performance on complex mathematical tasks, including
combinatorial optimization. Techniques such as Chain-of-Thought and In-Context
Learning have further enhanced this capability, making LLMs both powerful and
accessible tools for a wide range of users, including non-experts. However,
applying LLMs to matching problems, which require reasoning under preferential
and structural constraints, remains underexplored. To address this gap, we
introduce a novel benchmark of 369 instances of the College Admission Problem,
a canonical example of a matching problem with preferences, to evaluate LLMs
across key dimensions: feasibility, stability, and optimality. We employ this
benchmark to assess the performance of several open-weight LLMs. Our results
first reveal that while LLMs can satisfy certain constraints, they struggle to
meet all evaluation criteria consistently. They also show that reasoning LLMs,
like QwQ and GPT-oss, significantly outperform traditional models such as
Llama, Qwen or Mistral, defined here as models used without any dedicated
reasoning mechanisms. Moreover, we observed that LLMs reacted differently to
the various prompting strategies tested, which include Chain-of-Thought,
In-Context Learning and role-based prompting, with no prompt consistently
offering the best performance. Finally, we report the performances from
iterative prompting with auto-generated feedback and show that they are not
monotonic; they can peak early and then significantly decline in later
attempts. Overall, this work offers a new perspective on model reasoning
performance and the effectiveness of prompting strategies in combinatorial
optimization problems with preferential constraints.

Abstract: The cost and complexity of financial crime compliance (FCC) continue to rise,
often without measurable improvements in effectiveness. While AI offers
potential, most solutions remain opaque and poorly aligned with regulatory
expectations. This paper presents the design and deployment of an agentic AI
system for FCC in digitally native financial platforms. Developed through an
Action Design Research (ADR) process with a fintech firm and regulatory
stakeholders, the system automates onboarding, monitoring, investigation, and
reporting, emphasizing explainability, traceability, and compliance-by-design.
Using artifact-centric modeling, it assigns clearly bounded roles to autonomous
agents and enables task-specific model routing and audit logging. The
contribution includes a reference architecture, a real-world prototype, and
insights into how Agentic AI can reconfigure FCC workflows under regulatory
constraints. Our findings extend IS literature on AI-enabled compliance by
demonstrating how automation, when embedded within accountable governance
structures, can support transparency and institutional trust in high-stakes,
regulated environments.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出基于图的冲突集提取算法(G-CSEA)，用于高效识别伪布尔约束模型中的不可行子集，解决传统方法在调度问题中计算开销大的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 劳动力调度中存在大量基于规则的约束，这些约束可能相互冲突导致模型不可行。现有IIS提取方法如Additive Deletion和QuickXplain需要大量可行性检查，计算成本高；而对偶射线分析在处理伪布尔约束模型时可能失效。

Method: 提出Graph-based Conflict Set Extraction Algorithm (G-CSEA)，受SAT求解器中冲突驱动子句学习(CDCL)启发。方法在约束传播过程中构建蕴含图，检测到冲突时追踪所有决策分支中的贡献约束，生成冲突集，并可选择使用QuickXplain最小化为IIS。

Result: 开发了基于图的冲突集提取算法，能够有效处理伪布尔不等式约束，避免了传统方法的大量求解器调用，提高了不可行性诊断的效率。

Conclusion: G-CSEA算法为伪布尔约束模型提供了一种高效的不可行性诊断方法，特别适用于包含复杂调度规则的劳动力调度问题，能够快速识别导致冲突的最小约束子集。

Abstract: Workforce scheduling involves a variety of rule-based constraints-such as
shift limits, staffing policies, working hour restrictions, and many similar
scheduling rules-which can interact in conflicting ways, leading to infeasible
models. Identifying the underlying causes of such infeasibility is critical for
resolving scheduling issues and restoring feasibility. A common diagnostic
approach is to compute Irreducible Infeasible Subsets (IISs): minimal sets of
constraints that are jointly infeasible but become feasible when any one is
removed. We consider models formulated using pseudo-Boolean constraints with
inequality relations over binary variables, which naturally encode scheduling
logic. Existing IIS extraction methods such as Additive Deletion and
QuickXplain rely on repeated feasibility checks, often incurring large numbers
of solver calls. Dual ray analysis, while effective for LP-based models, may
fail when the relaxed problem is feasible but the underlying pseudo-Boolean
model is not. To address these limitations, we propose Graph-based Conflict Set
Extraction Algorithm (G-CSEA) to extract a conflict set, an approach inspired
by Conflict-Driven Clause Learning (CDCL) in SAT solvers. Our method constructs
an implication graph during constraint propagation and, upon detecting a
conflict, traces all contributing constraints across both decision branches.
The resulting conflict set can optionally be minimized using QuickXplain to
produce an IIS.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前FDA批准的糖尿病视网膜病变筛查系统主要提供二元转诊输出，这种最小化输出可能限制临床信任和实用性。需要确定最有效的输出格式来增强临床医生与AI的协作性能。

Method: 在IDRiD和Messidor-2数据集上测试GPT-4o和MedGemma两个模型，包括：(1)基线评估；(2)使用合成预测模拟AI辅助；(3)实际AI间协作，GPT-4o整合MedGemma输出。

Result: MedGemma在基线评估中表现优于GPT-4o，具有更高的敏感性和AUROC。GPT-4o在错误输入下性能崩溃，而MedGemma更稳定。在协作中，GPT-4o结合MedGemma描述性输出时AUROC可达0.96。

Conclusion: MLLMs可以改善DR筛查流程，并作为研究不同输出配置下临床AI辅助的可扩展模拟器。开放式轻量级模型如MedGemma在资源有限环境中特别有价值，描述性输出可增强临床工作流程中的可解释性和医生信任。

Abstract: Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a leading cause of blindness worldwide, and AI
systems can expand access to fundus photography screening. Current FDA-cleared
systems primarily provide binary referral outputs, where this minimal output
may limit clinical trust and utility. Yet, determining the most effective
output format to enhance clinician-AI performance is an empirical challenge
that is difficult to assess at scale. We evaluated multimodal large language
models (MLLMs) for DR detection and their ability to simulate clinical AI
assistance across different output types. Two models were tested on IDRiD and
Messidor-2: GPT-4o, a general-purpose MLLM, and MedGemma, an open-source
medical model. Experiments included: (1) baseline evaluation, (2) simulated AI
assistance with synthetic predictions, and (3) actual AI-to-AI collaboration
where GPT-4o incorporated MedGemma outputs. MedGemma outperformed GPT-4o at
baseline, achieving higher sensitivity and AUROC, while GPT-4o showed
near-perfect specificity but low sensitivity. Both models adjusted predictions
based on simulated AI inputs, but GPT-4o's performance collapsed with incorrect
ones, whereas MedGemma remained more stable. In actual collaboration, GPT-4o
achieved strong results when guided by MedGemma's descriptive outputs, even
without direct image access (AUROC up to 0.96). These findings suggest MLLMs
may improve DR screening pipelines and serve as scalable simulators for
studying clinical AI assistance across varying output configurations. Open,
lightweight models such as MedGemma may be especially valuable in low-resource
settings, while descriptive outputs could enhance explainability and clinician
trust in clinical workflows.

TL;DR: RepIt是一个简单高效的概念向量提取框架，能够从少量数据中分离出特定概念的表示，实现对LLM行为的精准干预，同时揭示了这种技术可能带来的安全风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的激活引导方法往往产生比预期更广泛的影响，需要更纯净的概念向量来实现针对性干预，并在更细粒度上理解LLM行为。

Method: 提出了RepIt框架，通过数据高效的方式分离概念特定的表示，能够在少量示例（如12个）和单块A6000 GPU上提取稳健的目标表示。

Result: 在五个前沿LLM上实现了精确干预：选择性抑制特定概念的拒绝行为，同时保持其他地方的拒绝能力；纠正信号仅定位到100-200个神经元；可在标准基准测试中保持安全评分。

Conclusion: RepIt展示了针对性干预可以抵消过度泛化问题，为更细粒度的模型行为控制奠定了基础，但同时也凸显了这种高效操作可能带来的安全担忧。

Abstract: While activation steering in large language models (LLMs) is a growing area
of research, methods can often incur broader effects than desired. This
motivates isolation of purer concept vectors to enable targeted interventions
and understand LLM behavior at a more granular level. We present RepIt, a
simple and data-efficient framework for isolating concept-specific
representations. Across five frontier LLMs, RepIt enables precise
interventions: it selectively suppresses refusal on targeted concepts while
preserving refusal elsewhere, producing models that answer WMD-related
questions while still scoring as safe on standard benchmarks. We further show
that the corrective signal localizes to just 100-200 neurons and that robust
target representations can be extracted from as few as a dozen examples on a
single A6000. This efficiency raises a dual concern: manipulations can be
performed with modest compute and data to extend to underrepresented
data-scarce topics while evading existing benchmarks. By disentangling refusal
vectors with RepIt, this work demonstrates that targeted interventions can
counteract overgeneralization, laying the foundation for more granular control
of model behavior.

Motivation: 为了解决语言智能代理在复杂现实环境中的认知建模问题，提出一种能够处理典型情况和异常情况的统一框架，旨在构建可解释、可扩展且值得信赖的代理系统。

Method: 采用基于形状的建模方法，包括特定的目标、假设、建模策略、知识库和实际模型实现，这些都在特定的认知架构中实施。形状是感官、语言、概念、情景和程序知识的记忆化星座。

Result: 提出了一个具体的形状建模框架，能够处理广泛的现象，支持在关键领域构建有用的代理系统。虽然以语言智能代理为例，但该原则可以更广泛地应用于知识型和混合型AI。

Conclusion: 形状认知范式为计算认知建模提供了新的方向，不仅能够验证假设，还能实现构建可解释、可扩展且值得信赖的代理系统的实际目标，为知识型和混合型AI注入新的活力。

Abstract: Shapes of cognition is a new conceptual paradigm for the computational
cognitive modeling of Language-Endowed Intelligent Agents (LEIAs). Shapes are
remembered constellations of sensory, linguistic, conceptual, episodic, and
procedural knowledge that allow agents to cut through the complexity of real
life the same way as people do: by expecting things to be typical, recognizing
patterns, acting by habit, reasoning by analogy, satisficing, and generally
minimizing cognitive load to the degree situations permit. Atypical outcomes
are treated using shapes-based recovery methods, such as learning on the fly,
asking a human partner for help, or seeking an actionable, even if imperfect,
situational understanding. Although shapes is an umbrella term, it is not
vague: shapes-based modeling involves particular objectives, hypotheses,
modeling strategies, knowledge bases, and actual models of wide-ranging
phenomena, all implemented within a particular cognitive architecture. Such
specificity is needed both to vet our hypotheses and to achieve our practical
aims of building useful agent systems that are explainable, extensible, and
worthy of our trust, even in critical domains. However, although the LEIA
example of shapes-based modeling is specific, the principles can be applied
more broadly, giving new life to knowledge-based and hybrid AI.

TL;DR: 该研究评估了当前客观图像质量评估指标在高保真压缩场景下的性能，特别是在JND阈值附近的失真检测能力，并提出了新的评估方法和统计测试。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着图像压缩技术向高保真质量范围发展，需要能够检测和量化细微压缩伪影的质量评估指标，但现有指标在此范围内的性能尚未得到充分研究。

Method: 使用JPEG AIC-3高保真图像压缩数据集，提出包含主观评分不确定性的Z-RMSE评估方法，应用新颖的统计测试来评估指标间的显著差异，并分析裁剪对主观测试的影响。

Result: 研究对JPEG AIC-3全范围及其高保真和中保真子集进行了全面分析，发布了包含基准和评估工具的公共数据集以支持后续研究。

Conclusion: 该研究填补了高保真图像压缩质量评估的空白，提供了系统的评估框架和工具，对专业图像处理应用具有重要意义。

Abstract: Nowadays, image compression solutions are increasingly designed to operate
within high-fidelity quality ranges, where preserving even the most subtle
details of the original image is essential. In this context, the ability to
detect and quantify subtle compression artifacts becomes critically important,
as even slight degradations can impact perceptual quality in professional or
quality sensitive applications, such as digital archiving, professional editing
and web delivery. However, the performance of current objective image quality
assessment metrics in this range has not been thoroughly investigated. In
particular, it is not well understood how reliably these metrics estimate
distortions at or below the threshold of Just Noticeable Difference (JND). This
study directly addresses this issue by proposing evaluation methodologies for
assessing the performance of objective quality metrics and performing a
comprehensive evaluation using the JPEG AIC-3 dataset which is designed for
high-fidelity image compression. Beyond conventional criteria, the study
introduces Z-RMSE to incorporate subjective score uncertainty and applies novel
statistical tests to assess significant differences between metrics. The
analysis spans the full JPEG AIC-3 range and its high- and medium-fidelity
subsets, examines the impact of cropping in subjective tests, and a public
dataset with benchmarks and evaluation tools is released to support further
research.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为NTM的新型神经网络架构，用于计算图结构随机微分博弈中的纳什均衡。该架构通过图引导的稀疏化技术，在神经网络中嵌入固定的非可训练组件，显著减少参数数量并提高可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图结构多智能体系统在金融、机器人、能源和社会动力学等领域广泛存在，但现有方法在处理大规模稀疏图结构时计算效率低下且缺乏可解释性。

Method: 设计NTM架构，在图结构上对前馈神经网络施加稀疏化约束，嵌入与图拓扑对齐的固定非可训练组件。将NTM集成到Direct Parameterization和Deep BSDE两种先进博弈求解器中。

Result: 理论证明NTM在静态图博弈中具有通用逼近性质。数值实验表明，基于NTM的方法在三种随机微分博弈中达到与全可训练方法相当的性能，同时显著提高计算效率。

Conclusion: NTM架构为大规模稀疏图结构博弈问题提供了一种高效、可解释的解决方案，在保持性能的同时大幅降低计算复杂度。

Abstract: We propose a novel neural network architecture, called Non-Trainable
Modification (NTM), for computing Nash equilibria in stochastic differential
games (SDGs) on graphs. These games model a broad class of graph-structured
multi-agent systems arising in finance, robotics, energy, and social dynamics,
where agents interact locally under uncertainty. The NTM architecture imposes a
graph-guided sparsification on feedforward neural networks, embedding fixed,
non-trainable components aligned with the underlying graph topology. This
design enhances interpretability and stability, while significantly reducing
the number of trainable parameters in large-scale, sparse settings. We
theoretically establish a universal approximation property for NTM in static
games on graphs and numerically validate its expressivity and robustness
through supervised learning tasks. Building on this foundation, we incorporate
NTM into two state-of-the-art game solvers, Direct Parameterization and Deep
BSDE, yielding their sparse variants (NTM-DP and NTM-DBSDE). Numerical
experiments on three SDGs across various graph structures demonstrate that
NTM-based methods achieve performance comparable to their fully trainable
counterparts, while offering improved computational efficiency.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Traces Propagation (TP)的前向传播、内存高效的完全局部学习规则，结合资格迹和分层对比损失，无需辅助矩阵，在多个SNN数据集上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决SNN训练中的时空信用分配问题，BPTT方法不符合生物神经系统的局部性，计算内存需求高，现有局部学习规则需要辅助矩阵导致内存开销大和可扩展性差。

Method: 提出TP学习规则，结合资格迹和分层对比损失，前向传播方式，无需辅助层间矩阵，实现完全局部学习。

Result: 在NMNIST和SHD数据集上优于其他完全局部学习规则，在DVS-GESTURE和DVS-CIFAR10等复杂数据集上表现竞争性，可扩展到VGG-9等深层架构，内存扩展性优于先前方法。

Conclusion: TP规则适合实际微调任务（如关键词识别），为边缘设备高效学习铺平道路。

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) provide an efficient framework for processing
dynamic spatio-temporal signals and for investigating the learning principles
underlying biological neural systems. A key challenge in training SNNs is to
solve both spatial and temporal credit assignment. The dominant approach for
training SNNs is Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT) with surrogate gradients.
However, BPTT is in stark contrast with the spatial and temporal locality
observed in biological neural systems and leads to high computational and
memory demands, limiting efficient training strategies and on-device learning.
Although existing local learning rules achieve local temporal credit assignment
by leveraging eligibility traces, they fail to address the spatial credit
assignment without resorting to auxiliary layer-wise matrices, which increase
memory overhead and hinder scalability, especially on embedded devices. In this
work, we propose Traces Propagation (TP), a forward-only, memory-efficient,
scalable, and fully local learning rule that combines eligibility traces with a
layer-wise contrastive loss without requiring auxiliary layer-wise matrices. TP
outperforms other fully local learning rules on NMNIST and SHD datasets. On
more complex datasets such as DVS-GESTURE and DVS-CIFAR10, TP showcases
competitive performance and scales effectively to deeper SNN architectures such
as VGG-9, while providing favorable memory scaling compared to prior fully
local scalable rules, for datasets with a significant number of classes.
Finally, we show that TP is well suited for practical fine-tuning tasks, such
as keyword spotting on the Google Speech Commands dataset, thus paving the way
for efficient learning at the edge.

8.3%. Compared to the classic reinforcement learning model Vanilla-DQN, MT-DQN
reduces MSE by 34.8% and MAE by 26.5%. Nonetheless, we also recognize
challenges in deploying MT-DQN in real-world scenarios, such as its
computational cost and latency sensitivity during online inference, which will
be addressed through future architectural optimization.

TL;DR: PowerGrow是一个用于生成电网结构和节点动态的协同生成框架，通过依赖分解和层次化图扩散过程，显著降低计算开销同时保持运行有效性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代电力系统日益动态化，但公开测试用例稀缺，需要能够联合合成电网结构和节点动态的生成工具，同时保持物理可行性和避免过高计算成本

Method: 采用依赖分解方法将复杂联合分布分解为条件分布链，使用层次化图beta扩散过程进行结构合成，配合时间自编码器将时间序列数据嵌入紧凑潜在空间

Result: 在基准测试中，PowerGrow不仅在前扩散模型的保真度和多样性方面表现优异，还实现了98.9%的潮流收敛率和改进的N-1事故恢复能力

Conclusion: PowerGrow能够生成运行有效且现实的电网场景，为解决电力系统测试用例稀缺问题提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Modern power systems are becoming increasingly dynamic, with changing
topologies and time-varying loads driven by renewable energy variability,
electric vehicle adoption, and active grid reconfiguration. Despite these
changes, publicly available test cases remain scarce, due to security concerns
and the significant effort required to anonymize real systems. Such limitations
call for generative tools that can jointly synthesize grid structure and nodal
dynamics. However, modeling the joint distribution of network topology, branch
attributes, bus properties, and dynamic load profiles remains a major
challenge, while preserving physical feasibility and avoiding prohibitive
computational costs. We present PowerGrow, a co-generative framework that
significantly reduces computational overhead while maintaining operational
validity. The core idea is dependence decomposition: the complex joint
distribution is factorized into a chain of conditional distributions over
feasible grid topologies, time-series bus loads, and other system attributes,
leveraging their mutual dependencies. By constraining the generation process at
each stage, we implement a hierarchical graph beta-diffusion process for
structural synthesis, paired with a temporal autoencoder that embeds
time-series data into a compact latent space, improving both training stability
and sample fidelity. Experiments across benchmark settings show that PowerGrow
not only outperforms prior diffusion models in fidelity and diversity but also
achieves a 98.9\% power flow convergence rate and improved N-1 contingency
resilience. This demonstrates its ability to generate operationally valid and
realistic power grid scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管去中心化学习在理论上得到广泛探索，但由于在大规模DNN训练中缺乏稳定性、可扩展性和通用性，尚未在生产环境中广泛应用。本研究旨在探索去中心化学习在生产环境中的实际应用。

Method: 引入DBench基准测试框架，包含中心化和去中心化DNN训练；提出基准测试方法分析模型精度与参数张量方差的相关性；基于观察结果提出Ada方法，采用去中心化SGD方法并动态调整通信图。

Result: 发现去中心化训练存在可扩展性和通用性问题；模型精度与通信图连接数相关；对参数张量方差异常敏感；Ada方法在1008个GPU上训练ResNet50时能获得最佳收敛率，模型精度与中心化学习相当。

Conclusion: Ada方法通过动态适应通信图，成功解决了大规模去中心化DNN训练的关键挑战，实现了与中心化学习相当的性能表现，为去中心化学习的生产应用提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Although it has been extensively explored in theory, decentralized learning
is not yet green-lighted for production use, largely due to a lack of
stability, scalability, and generality in large scale DNN training. To shed
light on the production use of decentralized learning, this work studies
decentralized data parallel training at scale. To this end, we introduce a
benchmarking framework, namely DBench, to host both centralized and
decentralized DNN training. Building upon DBench, we introduce a benchmarking
methodology to uncover the correlations between model accuracy and the
variances of parameter tensors by varying communication graphs and training
scales. Based on the benchmarking results, we observe that, (1) Similar to
centralized learning, decentralized data parallel training also presents the
issues of scalability and generality when the training scales up; (2) The model
accuracy of decentralized learning is correlated to the number of connections
in a communication graph; (3) The model accuracy of decentralized learning is
surprisingly sensitive to the variance of parameter tensors across model
replicas. Built upon the observations, we propose Ada, a decentralized adaptive
approach that performs large scale DNN training following a decentralized SGD
method and adapting the communication graph in use dynamically throughout
training iterations. We apply Ada on large scale training and observe that Ada
can obtain the best convergence rates consistently in decentralized DNN
training, and delivers equally or comparably good model accuracy for all sample
applications as centralized learning does, even when training ResNet50 for
ImageNet-1K on the scale of 1008 GPUs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MEUV框架将单一拒绝方向分解为多个主题对齐、近乎正交的向量，实现细粒度的敏感能力控制，在保持高攻击成功率的同时大幅减少跨主题泄漏。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM安全对齐机制会同时拒绝恶意请求和合法的高风险场景使用，而之前的单一拒绝方向编辑方法缺乏语义控制，会无差别解锁所有危险主题。

Method: 提出相互排斥解锁向量(MEUV)框架，通过多任务目标学习主题对齐的正交向量，包含差分消融边界、跨主题惩罚、正交性惩罚等辅助项，单epoch训练完成。

Result: 在双语恶意提示基准测试中，对Gemma-2-2B、LLaMA-3-8B和Qwen-7B模型攻击成功率不低于87%，跨主题泄漏相比最佳单方向基线减少高达90%，中英文向量可相互迁移。

Conclusion: MEUV证明了细粒度主题级能力激活的可行性，为安全敏感领域的可控LLM部署铺平了道路，且具有语言无关的拒绝子空间特性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) enforce safety alignment to reliably refuse
malicious requests, yet the same blanket safeguards also block legitimate uses
in policing, defense, and other high-stakes settings. Earlier
"refusal-direction" edits can bypass those layers, but they rely on a single
vector that indiscriminately unlocks all hazardous topics, offering no semantic
control. We introduce Mutually Exclusive Unlock Vectors (MEUV), a lightweight
framework that factorizes the monolithic refusal direction into topic-aligned,
nearly orthogonal vectors, each dedicated to one sensitive capability. MEUV is
learned in a single epoch with a multi-task objective that blends a
differential-ablation margin, cross-topic and orthogonality penalties, and
several auxiliary terms. On bilingual malicious-prompt benchmarks, MEUV
achieves an attack success rate of no less than 87% on Gemma-2-2B, LLaMA-3-8B,
and Qwen-7B, yet cuts cross-topic leakage by up to 90% compared with the best
single-direction baseline. Vectors trained in Chinese transfer almost unchanged
to English (and vice versa), suggesting a language-agnostic refusal subspace.
The results show that fine-grained, topic-level capability activation is
achievable with minimal utility loss, paving the way for controlled LLMs
deployment in security-sensitive domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模低轨卫星系统虽然能促进分布式AI模型协同训练，但由于隐私和监管限制无法集中原始数据，联邦学习成为替代方案。但卫星网络的动态拓扑和有限带宽会阻碍参数聚合，导致训练时间延长

Method: 设计离散时序图基础的按需调度框架，动态分配通信资源来加速联邦学习过程

Result: 仿真结果显示该方法相比传统统计复用策略显著提升性能，训练轮次时间减少14.20%至41.48%，且模型越大、客户端越多加速效果越明显

Conclusion: 提出的调度框架具有良好可扩展性，能有效解决卫星网络中联邦学习的通信瓶颈问题

Abstract: Large-scale low-Earth-orbit (LEO) satellite systems are increasingly valued
for their ability to enable rapid and wide-area data exchange, thereby
facilitating the collaborative training of artificial intelligence (AI) models
across geographically distributed regions. Due to privacy concerns and
regulatory constraints, raw data collected at remote clients cannot be
centrally aggregated, posing a major obstacle to traditional AI training
methods. Federated learning offers a privacy-preserving alternative by training
local models on distributed devices and exchanging only model parameters.
However, the dynamic topology and limited bandwidth of satellite systems will
hinder timely parameter aggregation and distribution, resulting in prolonged
training times. To address this challenge, we investigate the problem of
scheduling federated learning over satellite networks and identify key
bottlenecks that impact the overall duration of each training round. We propose
a discrete temporal graph-based on-demand scheduling framework that dynamically
allocates communication resources to accelerate federated learning. Simulation
results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves significant performance
gains over traditional statistical multiplexing-based model exchange
strategies, reducing overall round times by 14.20% to 41.48%. Moreover, the
acceleration effect becomes more pronounced for larger models and higher
numbers of clients, highlighting the scalability of the proposed approach.

Motivation: 传统基于计算流体动力学的气动形状优化计算成本过高，严重限制了设计空间探索，需要开发更高效的优化方法

Method: 使用变分自编码器，采用三平面隐式神经表示进行高保真3D几何重建，并添加阻力系数预测头。在包含8000个独特车辆几何形状和对应阻力系数的大规模数据集DrivAerNet++上进行训练

Result: 优化设计实现了高达11.8%的阻力系数降低，结果通过独立的高保真CFD模拟（超过1.5亿个网格单元）验证

Conclusion: 该框架实现了更敏捷的气动形状优化工作流程，减少了对计算密集型CFD模拟的依赖，特别是在早期设计阶段，且对非水密网格具有鲁棒性

Abstract: The computational cost of traditional Computational Fluid Dynamics-based
Aerodynamic Shape Optimization severely restricts design space exploration.
This paper introduces TripOptimizer, a fully differentiable deep learning
framework for rapid aerodynamic analysis and shape optimization directly from
vehicle point cloud data. TripOptimizer employs a Variational Autoencoder
featuring a triplane-based implicit neural representation for high-fidelity 3D
geometry reconstruction and a drag coefficient prediction head. Trained on
DrivAerNet++, a large-scale dataset of 8,000 unique vehicle geometries with
corresponding drag coefficients computed via Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes
simulations, the model learns a latent representation that encodes
aerodynamically salient geometric features. We propose an optimization strategy
that modifies a subset of the encoder parameters to steer an initial geometry
towards a target drag value, and demonstrate its efficacy in case studies where
optimized designs achieved drag coefficient reductions up to 11.8\%. These
results were subsequently validated by using independent, high-fidelity
Computational Fluid Dynamics simulations with more than 150 million cells. A
key advantage of the implicit representation is its inherent robustness to
geometric imperfections, enabling optimization of non-watertight meshes, a
significant challenge for traditional adjoint-based methods. The framework
enables a more agile Aerodynamic Shape Optimization workflow, reducing reliance
on computationally intensive CFD simulations, especially during early design
stages.

Result: 实验结果表明所提方法在不同设置下均有效，能够同时估计流行病状态和参数并生成最优控制策略

Conclusion: 该框架成功实现了SIR模型的状态和参数联合实时估计，为流行病控制提供了有效的MPC-PINNs解决方案

Abstract: This work introduces a physics-informed neural networks (PINNs)-based model
predictive control (MPC) framework for susceptible-infected-recovered ($SIR$)
spreading models. Existing studies in MPC design for epidemic control often
assume either 1) measurable states of the dynamics, where the parameters are
learned, or 2) known parameters of the model, where the states are learned. In
this work, we address the joint real-time estimation of states and parameters
within the MPC framework using only noisy infected states, under the assumption
that 1) only the recovery rate is known, or 2) only the basic reproduction
number is known. Under the first assumption, we propose MPC-PINNs and two novel
PINNs algorithms, all of which are integrated into the MPC framework. First, we
introduce MPC-PINNs, which are designed for $SIR$ models with control. We then
propose log-scaled PINNs (MPC-LS-PINNs), which incorporate a log-scaled loss
function to improve robustness against noise. Next, we present split-integral
PINNs (MPC-SI-PINNs), which leverage integral operators and state coupling in
the neural network training process to effectively reconstruct the complete
epidemic state information. Building upon these methods, we further extend our
framework for the second assumption. We establish the necessary conditions and
extend our PINNs algorithms, where MPC-SI-PINNs are simplified as split-PINNs
(MPC-S-PINNs). By incorporating these algorithms into the MPC framework, we
simultaneously estimate the epidemic states and parameters while generating
optimal control strategies. Experiment results demonstrate the effectiveness of
the proposed methods under different settings.

Conclusion: 该框架通过实现考虑数据异质性和任务相关性的逐主体自适应信息处理，解决了个性化医疗中的关键挑战，可改善心理健康结果、提高治疗分配精度和临床成本效益。

Abstract: We propose a unified framework for adaptive routing in multitask, multimodal
prediction settings where data heterogeneity and task interactions vary across
samples. Motivated by applications in psychotherapy where structured
assessments and unstructured clinician notes coexist with partially missing
data and correlated outcomes, we introduce a routing-based architecture that
dynamically selects modality processing pathways and task-sharing strategies on
a per-sample basis. Our model defines multiple modality paths, including raw
and fused representations of text and numeric features and learns to route each
input through the most informative expert combination. Task-specific
predictions are produced by shared or independent heads depending on the
routing decision, and the entire system is trained end-to-end. We evaluate the
model on both synthetic data and real-world psychotherapy notes predicting
depression and anxiety outcomes. Our experiments show that our method
consistently outperforms fixed multitask or single-task baselines, and that the
learned routing policy provides interpretable insights into modality relevance
and task structure. This addresses critical challenges in personalized
healthcare by enabling per-subject adaptive information processing that
accounts for data heterogeneity and task correlations. Applied to
psychotherapy, this framework could improve mental health outcomes, enhance
treatment assignment precision, and increase clinical cost-effectiveness
through personalized intervention strategies.

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) with parameter-efficient techniques
such as LoRA and QLoRA has enabled adaptation of foundation models on modest
hardware. Yet the efficiency of such training on consumer-grade GPUs,
especially under strict 8 GB VRAM limits, remains underexplored. We present a
controlled profiling study of LoRA/QLoRA fine-tuning using the
Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct model on a single NVIDIA RTX 4060. Across three
representative configurations, we systematically vary batch size, sequence
length, optimizer choice (AdamW vs. PagedAdamW), and precision (fp16 vs. bf16).
We report throughput (tokens/s), time per 10k tokens, and VRAM footprint,
alongside energy estimates derived from GPU board power limits. Our results
show that paged optimizers improve throughput by up to 25% (628 tok/s vs. 500
tok/s baseline), while bf16 degrades efficiency relative to fp16. Despite 8 GB
constraints, sequence lengths up to 2048 tokens were feasible using
parameter-efficient strategies. To our knowledge, this is the first systematic
case study of LLM fine-tuning efficiency on consumer GPUs, providing
reproducible benchmarks and practical guidelines for resource-constrained
researchers and practitioners.

Conclusion: PerM-MoE通过独立模态路由器的设计，显著提升了多模态模型在临床常见模态缺失场景下的预测性能和实用性。

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease with high
inter-patient variance in rate of cognitive decline. AD progression prediction
aims to forecast patient cognitive decline and benefits from incorporating
multiple neuroimaging modalities. However, existing multimodal models fail to
make accurate predictions when many modalities are missing during inference, as
is often the case in clinical settings. To increase multimodal model
flexibility under high modality missingness, we introduce PerM-MoE, a novel
sparse mixture-of-experts method that uses independent routers for each
modality in place of the conventional, single router. Using T1-weighted MRI,
FLAIR, amyloid beta PET, and tau PET neuroimaging data from the Alzheimer's
Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), we evaluate PerM-MoE, state-of-the-art
Flex-MoE, and unimodal neuroimaging models on predicting two-year change in
Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) scores under varying levels of
modality missingness. PerM-MoE outperforms the state of the art in most
variations of modality missingness and demonstrates more effective utility of
experts than Flex-MoE.

claim "SFT memorizes, RL generalizes" is over-simplified, and discover that:
(1) OOD performance peaks at the early stage of SFT and then declines (OOD
forgetting), the best SFT checkpoint cannot be captured by training/test loss;
(2) the subsequent RL stage does not generate fundamentally better OOD
capability, instead it plays an \textbf{OOD restoration} role, recovering the
lost reasoning ability during SFT; (3) The recovery ability has boundaries,
\ie{} \textbf{if SFT trains for too short or too long, RL cannot recover the
lost OOD ability;} (4) To uncover the underlying mechanisms behind the
forgetting and restoration process, we employ SVD analysis on parameter
matrices, manually edit them, and observe their impacts on model performance.
Unlike the common belief that the shift of model capacity mainly results from
the changes of singular values, we find that they are actually quite stable
throughout fine-tuning. Instead, the OOD behavior strongly correlates with the
\textbf{rotation of singular vectors}. Our findings re-identify the roles of
SFT and RL in the two-stage fine-tuning and discover the rotation of singular
vectors as the key mechanism. %reversing the rotations induced by SFT, which
shows recovery from forgetting, whereas imposing the SFT parameter directions
onto a RL-tuned model results in performance degradation. Code is available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于微分同胚嵌入神经算子的新框架NDNO，用于高效预测不同几何形状结构件的加工变形，解决了传统数值方法计算成本高和神经算子直接应用于变化几何域的限制问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 结构件加工变形预测对保证尺寸精度和可靠性至关重要，但传统数值方法计算成本高，特别是处理不同几何形状时。神经算子虽能高效求解偏微分方程，但直接应用于变化几何域存在理论和实践限制。

Method: 通过受平滑性和可逆性约束的微分同胚神经网络将复杂三维几何映射到公共参考域，然后在参考域上训练神经算子学习残余应力引起的变形场。训练完成后，微分同胚神经网络和神经算子都能高效预测，快速适应不同几何形状。

Conclusion: NDNO框架为不同几何形状结构件的变形预测提供了有效且计算高效的解决方案，验证了其在多样几何零件上的准确性和效率。

Abstract: Accurate prediction of machining deformation in structural components is
essential for ensuring dimensional precision and reliability. Such deformation
often originates from residual stress fields, whose distribution and influence
vary significantly with geometric complexity. Conventional numerical methods
for modeling the coupling between residual stresses and deformation are
computationally expensive, particularly when diverse geometries are considered.
Neural operators have recently emerged as a powerful paradigm for efficiently
solving partial differential equations, offering notable advantages in
accelerating residual stress-deformation analysis. However, their direct
application across changing geometric domains faces theoretical and practical
limitations. To address this challenge, a novel framework based on
diffeomorphic embedding neural operators named neural diffeomorphic-neural
operator (NDNO) is introduced. Complex three-dimensional geometries are
explicitly mapped to a common reference domain through a diffeomorphic neural
network constrained by smoothness and invertibility. The neural operator is
then trained on this reference domain, enabling efficient learning of
deformation fields induced by residual stresses. Once trained, both the
diffeomorphic neural network and the neural operator demonstrate efficient
prediction capabilities, allowing rapid adaptation to varying geometries. The
proposed method thus provides an effective and computationally efficient
solution for deformation prediction in structural components subject to varying
geometries. The proposed method is validated to predict both main-direction and
multi-direction deformation fields, achieving high accuracy and efficiency
across parts with diverse geometries including component types, dimensions and
features.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本研究通过改进关联规则挖掘方法，分析滤泡性甲状腺癌的临床数据，识别出多个与恶性肿瘤相关的临床指标，为术前诊断提供参考。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 滤泡性甲状腺癌缺乏特异性超声征象，术前诊断比乳头状甲状腺癌更困难，相关临床研究较少。研究旨在通过数据挖掘工具分析临床数据，找出有助于术前诊断的临床指标。

Method: 基于2010-2023年北京大学第三医院收集的病例数据进行回顾性分析。改进传统的关联规则挖掘方法，结合可解释机器学习中的SHAP方法思想，提出新的分析指标来反映临床指标与癌症之间的恶性关联。

Result: 数据集包含1673个结节（1414个良性，259个恶性）。分析发现除了常见指标（不规则或分叶状结节边缘、不均匀厚度晕环、低回声）外，还有结节内结节模式、小梁模式和低TSH评分等强恶性关联指标。同时，合并桥本甲状腺炎也可能具有强恶性关联。

Conclusion: 在疑似滤泡性甲状腺癌结节的术前诊断中，应考虑多个临床指标以提高诊断准确性。研究中发现的多样化恶性关联指标可为相关领域临床医生提供参考。

Abstract: Purpose: Thyroid cancer has been a common cancer. Papillary thyroid cancer
and follicular thyroid cancer are the two most common types of thyroid cancer.
Follicular thyroid cancer lacks distinctive ultrasound signs and is more
difficult to diagnose preoperatively than the more prevalent papillary thyroid
cancer, and the clinical studies associated with it are less well established.
We aimed to analyze the clinical data of follicular thyroid cancer based on a
novel data mining tool to identify some clinical indications that may help in
preoperative diagnosis. Methods: We performed a retrospective analysis based on
case data collected by the Department of General Surgery of Peking University
Third Hospital between 2010 and 2023. Unlike traditional statistical methods,
we improved the association rule mining, a classical data mining method, and
proposed new analytical metrics reflecting the malignant association between
clinical indications and cancer with the help of the idea of SHAP method in
interpretable machine learning. Results: The dataset was preprocessed to
contain 1673 cases (in terms of nodes rather than patients), of which 1414 were
benign and 259 were malignant nodes. Our analysis pointed out that in addition
to some common indicators (e.g., irregular or lobulated nodal margins, uneven
thickness halo, hypoechogenicity), there were also some indicators with strong
malignant associations, such as nodule-in-nodule pattern, trabecular pattern,
and low TSH scores. In addition, our results suggest that the combination of
Hashimoto's thyroiditis may also have a strong malignant association.
Conclusion: In the preoperative diagnosis of nodules suspected of follicular
thyroid cancer, multiple clinical indications should be considered for a more
accurate diagnosis. The diverse malignant associations identified in our study
may serve as a reference for clinicians in related fields.

Abstract: This work introduces InJecteD, a framework for interpreting Denoising
Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) by analyzing sample trajectories during
the denoising process of 2D point cloud generation. We apply this framework to
three datasets from the Datasaurus Dozen bullseye, dino, and circle using a
simplified DDPM architecture with customizable input and time embeddings. Our
approach quantifies trajectory properties, including displacement, velocity,
clustering, and drift field dynamics, using statistical metrics such as
Wasserstein distance and cosine similarity. By enhancing model transparency,
InJecteD supports human AI collaboration by enabling practitioners to debug and
refine generative models. Experiments reveal distinct denoising phases: initial
noise exploration, rapid shape formation, and final refinement, with
dataset-specific behaviors example, bullseyes concentric convergence vs. dinos
complex contour formation. We evaluate four model configurations, varying
embeddings and noise schedules, demonstrating that Fourier based embeddings
improve trajectory stability and reconstruction quality

Method: 理论分析简单实用的JEPA变体，包含联合训练的辅助回归头和潜在动态，在确定性MDP中证明理论定理

Result: 证明了"无病态表示坍塌"定理：当训练使损失趋零时，非等价观测必须映射到不同的潜在表示，辅助任务锚定了表示必须保持的区分

Conclusion: 联合训练JEPA和辅助头比单独训练产生更丰富的表示，为改进JEPA编码器指明了路径：使用与转移动态共同编码正确等价关系的辅助函数

Abstract: Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA) is increasingly used for
visual representation learning and as a component in model-based RL, but its
behavior remains poorly understood. We provide a theoretical characterization
of a simple, practical JEPA variant that has an auxiliary regression head
trained jointly with latent dynamics. We prove a No Unhealthy Representation
Collapse theorem: in deterministic MDPs, if training drives both the
latent-transition consistency loss and the auxiliary regression loss to zero,
then any pair of non-equivalent observations, i.e., those that do not have the
same transition dynamics or auxiliary label, must map to distinct latent
representations. Thus, the auxiliary task anchors which distinctions the
representation must preserve. Controlled ablations in a counting environment
corroborate the theory and show that training the JEPA model jointly with the
auxiliary head generates a richer representation than training them separately.
Our work indicates a path to improve JEPA encoders: training them with an
auxiliary function that, together with the transition dynamics, encodes the
right equivalence relations.

Conclusion: GraphSAGE框架具有归纳能力、可扩展性和可解释性，为金融机构利用图机器学习在交易生态系统中获得可操作见解提供了蓝图。

Abstract: Financial institutions increasingly require scalable tools to analyse complex
transactional networks, yet traditional graph embedding methods struggle with
dynamic, real-world banking data. This paper demonstrates the practical
application of GraphSAGE, an inductive Graph Neural Network framework, to
non-bipartite heterogeneous transaction networks within a banking context.
Unlike transductive approaches, GraphSAGE scales well to large networks and can
generalise to unseen nodes which is critical for institutions working with
temporally evolving transactional data. We construct a transaction network
using anonymised customer and merchant transactions and train a GraphSAGE model
to generate node embeddings. Our exploratory work on the embeddings reveals
interpretable clusters aligned with geographic and demographic attributes.
Additionally, we illustrate their utility in downstream classification tasks by
applying them to a money mule detection model where using these embeddings
improves the prioritisation of high-risk accounts. Beyond fraud detection, our
work highlights the adaptability of this framework to banking-scale networks,
emphasising its inductive capability, scalability, and interpretability. This
study provides a blueprint for financial organisations to harness graph machine
learning for actionable insights in transactional ecosystems.

Result: 提出了一个基于最大似然估计的概率框架，为Transformer的注意力机制提供了新的解释视角。

Conclusion: 该方法为Transformer模型中的scaled-dot-product和softmax函数提供了概率论基础，可能有助于更好地理解和改进注意力机制。

Abstract: In this paper, we present a maximum likelihood estimation approach to
determine the value vector in transformer models. We model the sequence of
value vectors, key vectors, and the query vector as a sequence of Gaussian
distributions. The variance in each Gaussian distribution depends on the time
step, the corresponding key vector, and the query vector. The mean value in
each Gaussian distribution depends on the time step, and the corresponding
value vector. This analysis may offer a new explanation of the
scaled-dot-product function or softmax function used in transformer
architectures [1]. Another explanation, inspired by [4], is based on the
maximum entropy approach in natural language processing [5]. In this approach,
a query vector and key vectors are used to derive the feature functions for the
maximum entropy model.

accuracy. The experiment was conducted using the Stocks index price data and
the AWS Braket SV1 simulator for training the QGAN circuits. The

Conclusion: C3DE模型有效解决了长期城市人流预测中的累积误差和虚假相关性问题，为城市人流动态建模提供了新的解决方案

Abstract: Long-term urban crowd flow prediction suffers significantly from cumulative
sampling errors, due to increased sequence lengths and sampling intervals,
which inspired us to leverage Neural Controlled Differential Equations (NCDEs)
to mitigate this issue. However, regarding the crucial influence of Points of
Interest (POIs) evolution on long-term crowd flow, the multi-timescale
asynchronous dynamics between crowd flow and POI distribution, coupled with
latent spurious causality, poses challenges to applying NCDEs for long-term
urban crowd flow prediction. To this end, we propose Causal-aware Collaborative
neural CDE (C3DE) to model the long-term dynamic of crowd flow. Specifically,
we introduce a dual-path NCDE as the backbone to effectively capture the
asynchronous evolution of collaborative signals across multiple time scales.
Then, we design a dynamic correction mechanism with the counterfactual-based
causal effect estimator to quantify the causal impact of POIs on crowd flow and
minimize the accumulation of spurious correlations. Finally, we leverage a
predictor for long-term prediction with the fused collaborative signals of POI
and crowd flow. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate
the superior performance of C3DE, particularly in cities with notable flow
fluctuations.

Motivation: 理解神经网络如何有机地学习为下游处理准备输入数据，以及研究KA几何结构的出现规律以通过及时调整超参数来加速学习。

Method: 通过分析单隐藏层神经网络Jacobian矩阵的外幂统计特性（零行数量和子式统计量）来量化KA几何结构，测量Jacobian矩阵的尺度和轴对齐特性。

Result: 发现传统单隐藏层神经网络训练时经常会产生KA几何结构，并对这种几何结构在函数复杂度和模型超参数空间中的出现位置有了初步理解。

Conclusion: KA几何结构可以在传统MLP中自发涌现，这为理解神经网络内部表示的形成机制和优化训练过程提供了新的视角，是KA-Networks研究的另一面。

Abstract: The Kolmogorov-Arnold (KA) representation theorem constructs universal, but
highly non-smooth inner functions (the first layer map) in a single
(non-linear) hidden layer neural network. Such universal functions have a
distinctive local geometry, a "texture," which can be characterized by the
inner function's Jacobian $J({\mathbf{x}})$, as $\mathbf{x}$ varies over the
data. It is natural to ask if this distinctive KA geometry emerges through
conventional neural network optimization. We find that indeed KA geometry often
is produced when training vanilla single hidden layer neural networks. We
quantify KA geometry through the statistical properties of the exterior powers
of $J(\mathbf{x})$: number of zero rows and various observables for the minor
statistics of $J(\mathbf{x})$, which measure the scale and axis alignment of
$J(\mathbf{x})$. This leads to a rough understanding for where KA geometry
occurs in the space of function complexity and model hyperparameters. The
motivation is first to understand how neural networks organically learn to
prepare input data for later downstream processing and, second, to learn enough
about the emergence of KA geometry to accelerate learning through a timely
intervention in network hyperparameters. This research is the "flip side" of
KA-Networks (KANs). We do not engineer KA into the neural network, but rather
watch KA emerge in shallow MLPs.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to optimizing pricing and replenishment
strategies in fresh food supermarkets by combining Long Short-Term Memory
(LSTM) networks with Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). The LSTM model,
enhanced with an attention mechanism, is used to predict sales volumes, pricing
trends, and spoilage rates over a seven-day period. The predictions generated
by the LSTM model serve as inputs for the PSO algorithm, which iteratively
optimizes pricing and replenishment strategies to maximize profitability while
adhering to inventory constraints. The integration of cost-plus pricing allows
for dynamic adjustments based on fixed and variable costs, ensuring real-time
adaptability to market fluctuations. The framework not only maximizes profits
but also reduces food waste, contributing to more sustainable supermarket
operations. The attention mechanism enhances the interpretability of the LSTM
model by identifying key time points and factors influencing sales, improving
decision-making accuracy. This methodology bridges the gap between predictive
modeling and optimization, offering a scalable solution for dynamic pricing and
inventory management in fresh food retail and other industries dealing with
perishable goods.

Abstract: Deep Operator Networks (DeepONets) have recently emerged as powerful
data-driven frameworks for learning nonlinear operators, particularly suited
for approximating solutions to partial differential equations (PDEs). Despite
their promising capabilities, the standard implementation of DeepONets, which
typically employs fully connected linear layers in the trunk network, can
encounter limitations in capturing complex spatial structures inherent to
various PDEs. To address this, we introduce Fourier-embedded trunk networks
within the DeepONet architecture, leveraging random Fourier feature mappings to
enrich spatial representation capabilities. Our proposed Fourier-embedded
DeepONet, FEDONet demonstrates superior performance compared to the traditional
DeepONet across a comprehensive suite of PDE-driven datasets, including the
two-dimensional Poisson equation, Burgers' equation, the Lorenz-63 chaotic
system, Eikonal equation, Allen-Cahn equation, Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation,
and the Lorenz-96 system. Empirical evaluations of FEDONet consistently show
significant improvements in solution reconstruction accuracy, with average
relative L2 performance gains ranging between 2-3x compared to the DeepONet
baseline. This study highlights the effectiveness of Fourier embeddings in
enhancing neural operator learning, offering a robust and broadly applicable
methodology for PDE surrogate modeling.

features, drastically increasing dimensionality. Additionally, the limited
number of training samples makes classification challenging. Linear
dimensionality reduction of word embeddings for tabular data classification
remains underexplored. This paper studies Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA). We show that PCA, with an appropriate
subspace dimension, can outperform raw embeddings. LDA without regularization
performs poorly due to covariance estimation errors, but applying shrinkage
improves performance significantly, even with only two dimensions. We propose
Partitioned-LDA, which splits embeddings into equal-sized blocks and performs
LDA separately on each, thereby reducing the size of the covariance matrices.
Partitioned-LDA outperforms regular LDA and, combined with shrinkage, achieves
top-10 accuracy on the competition public leaderboard. This method effectively
enhances word embedding performance in tabular data classification with limited
training samples.

TL;DR: 提出MEAGraph模型，一种无监督方法用于分析原子数据集，通过多核变换和注意力机制有效识别和分组相似原子环境，帮助去除数据集中的采样偏差。


<details>

Abstract: Constructing a chemically diverse dataset while avoiding sampling bias is
critical to training efficient and generalizable force fields. However, in
computational chemistry and materials science, many common dataset generation
techniques are prone to oversampling regions of the potential energy surface.
Furthermore, these regions can be difficult to identify and isolate from each
other or may not align well with human intuition, making it challenging to
systematically remove bias in the dataset. While traditional clustering and
pruning (down-sampling) approaches can be useful for this, they can often lead
to information loss or a failure to properly identify distinct regions of the
potential energy surface due to difficulties associated with the high
dimensionality of atomic descriptors. In this work, we introduce the
Multi-kernel Edge Attention-based Graph Autoencoder (MEAGraph) model, an
unsupervised approach for analyzing atomic datasets. MEAGraph combines multiple
linear kernel transformations with attention-based message passing to capture
geometric sensitivity and enable effective dataset pruning without relying on
labels or extensive training. Demonstrated applications on niobium, tantalum,
and iron datasets show that MEAGraph efficiently groups similar atomic
environments, allowing for the use of basic pruning techniques for removing
sampling bias. This approach provides an effective method for representation
learning and clustering that can be used for data analysis, outlier detection,
and dataset optimization.

Abstract: The agricultural sector is undergoing a transformation with the integration
of advanced technologies, particularly in data-driven decision-making. This
work proposes a federated learning framework for smart farming, aiming to
develop a scalable, efficient, and secure solution for crop disease detection
tailored to the environmental and operational conditions of Minnesota farms. By
maintaining sensitive farm data locally and enabling collaborative model
updates, our proposed framework seeks to achieve high accuracy in crop disease
classification without compromising data privacy. We outline a methodology
involving data collection from Minnesota farms, application of local deep
learning algorithms, transfer learning, and a central aggregation server for
model refinement, aiming to achieve improved accuracy in disease detection,
good generalization across agricultural scenarios, lower costs in communication
and training time, and earlier identification and intervention against diseases
in future implementations. We outline a methodology and anticipated outcomes,
setting the stage for empirical validation in subsequent studies. This work
comes in a context where more and more demand for data-driven interpretations
in agriculture has to be weighed with concerns about privacy from farms that
are hesitant to share their operational data. This will be important to provide
a secure and efficient disease detection method that can finally revolutionize
smart farming systems and solve local agricultural problems with data
confidentiality. In doing so, this paper bridges the gap between advanced
machine learning techniques and the practical, privacy-sensitive needs of
farmers in Minnesota and beyond, leveraging the benefits of federated learning.

Abstract: The nuclear industry is advancing toward more new reactor designs, with
next-generation reactors expected to be smaller in scale and power output.
These systems have the potential to produce large volumes of information in the
form of multivariate time-series data, which could be used for enhanced
real-time monitoring and control. In this context, the development of remote
autonomous or semi-autonomous control systems for reactor operation has gained
significant interest. A critical first step toward such systems is an accurate
diagnostics module capable of detecting and localizing anomalies within the
reactor system. Recent studies have proposed various ML and DL approaches for
anomaly detection in the nuclear domain. Despite promising results, key
challenges remain, including limited to no explainability, lack of access to
real-world data, and scarcity of abnormal events, which impedes benchmarking
and characterization. Most existing studies treat these methods as black boxes,
while recent work highlights the need for greater interpretability of ML/DL
outputs in safety-critical domains. Here, we propose an unsupervised
methodology based on an LSTM autoencoder with a dual attention mechanism for
characterization of abnormal events in a real-world reactor radiation area
monitoring system. The framework includes not only detection but also
localization of the event and was evaluated using real-world datasets of
increasing complexity from the PUR-1 research reactor. The attention mechanisms
operate in both the feature and temporal dimensions, where the feature
attention assigns weights to radiation sensors exhibiting abnormal patterns,
while time attention highlights the specific timesteps where irregularities
occur, thus enabling localization. By combining the results, the framework can
identify both the affected sensors and the duration of each anomaly within a
single unified network.

Abstract: Training deep learning methods on small time series datasets that also
include corrupted samples is challenging. Diffusion models have shown to be
effective to generate realistic and synthetic data, and correct corrupted
samples through imputation. In this context, this paper focuses on generating
synthetic yet realistic samples of automotive time series data. We show that
denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) can effectively solve this
task by applying them to a challenging vehicle CAN-dataset with long-term data
and a limited number of samples. Therefore, we propose a hybrid generative
approach that combines autoregressive and non-autoregressive techniques. We
evaluate our approach with two recently proposed DDPM architectures for time
series generation, for which we propose several improvements. To evaluate the
generated samples, we propose three metrics that quantify physical correctness
and test track adherence. Our best model is able to outperform even the
training data in terms of physical correctness, while showing plausible driving
behavior. Finally, we use our best model to successfully impute physically
implausible regions in the training data, thereby improving the data quality.

Abstract: Modern deep learning models excel at pattern recognition but remain
fundamentally limited by their reliance on spurious correlations, leading to
poor generalization and a demand for massive datasets. We argue that a key
ingredient for human-like intelligence-robust, sample-efficient learning-stems
from an understanding of causal mechanisms. In this work, we introduce
Causal-Symbolic Meta-Learning (CSML), a novel framework that learns to infer
the latent causal structure of a task distribution. CSML comprises three key
modules: a perception module that maps raw inputs to disentangled symbolic
representations; a differentiable causal induction module that discovers the
underlying causal graph governing these symbols and a graph-based reasoning
module that leverages this graph to make predictions. By meta-learning a shared
causal world model across a distribution of tasks, CSML can rapidly adapt to
novel tasks, including those requiring reasoning about interventions and
counterfactuals, from only a handful of examples. We introduce CausalWorld, a
new physics-based benchmark designed to test these capabilities. Our
experiments show that CSML dramatically outperforms state-of-the-art
meta-learning and neuro-symbolic baselines, particularly on tasks demanding
true causal inference.

Motivation: 现有的前向-前向算法扩展虽然改进了原始算法并适应了CNN，但由于通道维度爆炸问题，往往存在表示能力有限和在大规模数据集上扩展性差的问题。

Method: 提出ASGE框架，利用特征图计算每层的空间感知goodness表示，实现逐层监督。该方法将分类复杂度与通道维度解耦，解决了通道爆炸问题。

Result: 在多个基准测试中优于所有其他基于前向-前向的方法：MNIST 99.65%、FashionMNIST 93.41%、CIFAR-10 90.62%、CIFAR-100 65.42%。首次成功应用于ImageNet，Top-1准确率26.21%，Top-5准确率47.49%。

Conclusion: ASGE框架完全消除了反向传播，显著缩小了与BP训练模型的性能差距，为可扩展的无反向传播CNN训练奠定了可行基础。

Abstract: The Forward-Forward (FF) algorithm offers a promising alternative to
backpropagation (BP). Despite advancements in recent FF-based extensions, which
have enhanced the original algorithm and adapted it to convolutional neural
networks (CNNs), they often suffer from limited representational capacity and
poor scalability to large-scale datasets, primarily due to exploding channel
dimensionality. In this work, we propose adaptive spatial goodness encoding
(ASGE), a new FF-based training framework tailored for CNNs. ASGE leverages
feature maps to compute spatially-aware goodness representations at each layer,
enabling layer-wise supervision. Crucially, this approach decouples
classification complexity from channel dimensionality, thereby addressing the
issue of channel explosion and achieving competitive performance compared to
other BP-free methods. ASGE outperforms all other FF-based approaches across
multiple benchmarks, delivering test accuracies of 99.65% on MNIST, 93.41% on
FashionMNIST, 90.62% on CIFAR-10, and 65.42% on CIFAR-100. Moreover, we present
the first successful application of FF-based training to ImageNet, with Top-1
and Top-5 accuracies of 26.21% and 47.49%. By entirely eliminating BP and
significantly narrowing the performance gap with BP-trained models, the ASGE
framework establishes a viable foundation toward scalable BP-free CNN training.

Motivation: 当前谱学习方法只能提供点估计而缺乏不确定性量化，限制了在安全关键应用中的使用。参数矩阵模型虽然性能优异，但其确定性本质阻碍了在不确定性量化应用中的部署。

Conclusion: 该框架支持在不确定性关键领域的稳健谱学习，为更广泛的贝叶斯谱机器学习奠定了基础。

Abstract: Scientific machine learning increasingly uses spectral methods to understand
physical systems. Current spectral learning approaches provide only point
estimates without uncertainty quantification, limiting their use in
safety-critical applications where prediction confidence is essential.
Parametric matrix models have emerged as powerful tools for scientific machine
learning, achieving exceptional performance by learning governing equations.
However, their deterministic nature limits deployment in uncertainty
quantification applications. We introduce Bayesian parametric matrix models
(B-PMMs), a principled framework that extends PMMs to provide uncertainty
estimates while preserving their spectral structure and computational
efficiency. B-PMM addresses the fundamental challenge of quantifying
uncertainty in matrix eigenvalue problems where standard Bayesian methods fail
due to the geometric constraints of spectral decomposition. The theoretical
contributions include: (i) adaptive spectral decomposition with regularized
matrix perturbation bounds that characterize eigenvalue uncertainty
propagation, (ii) structured variational inference algorithms using
manifold-aware matrix-variate Gaussian posteriors that respect Hermitian
constraints, and (iii) finite-sample calibration guarantees with explicit
dependence on spectral gaps and problem conditioning. Experimental validation
across matrix dimensions from 5x5 to 500x500 with perfect convergence rates
demonstrates that B-PMMs achieve exceptional uncertainty calibration (ECE <
0.05) while maintaining favorable scaling. The framework exhibits graceful
degradation under spectral ill-conditioning and provides reliable uncertainty
estimates even in near-degenerate regimes. The proposed framework supports
robust spectral learning in uncertainty-critical domains and lays the
groundwork for broader Bayesian spectral machine learning.

Motivation: 现有方法在纠正机器学习模型和LLMs标注非结构化数据时的偏差时，往往产生较大的标准误差，且需要一些无错误的人工标注。

Method: 提出SRI方法，假设非结构化数据完全中介人类标注与结构化变量之间的关系，设计神经网络架构学习满足代理假设的低维表示，可校正人类标注中的非差分测量误差。

Result: 模拟研究和实际应用显示，当机器学习预测准确度中等时，SRI能将标准误差降低50%以上，即使在人类标注存在非差分测量误差时也能提供有效推断。

Conclusion: SRI方法通过利用非结构化数据的低维表示，显著提高了统计推断的效率和有效性，特别是在人类标注存在误差的情况下仍能保持稳健性。

Abstract: As researchers increasingly rely on machine learning models and LLMs to
annotate unstructured data, such as texts or images, various approaches have
been proposed to correct bias in downstream statistical analysis. However,
existing methods tend to yield large standard errors and require some
error-free human annotation. In this paper, I introduce Surrogate
Representation Inference (SRI), which assumes that unstructured data fully
mediate the relationship between human annotations and structured variables.
The assumption is guaranteed by design provided that human coders rely only on
unstructured data for annotation. Under this setting, I propose a neural
network architecture that learns a low-dimensional representation of
unstructured data such that the surrogate assumption remains to be satisfied.
When multiple human annotations are available, SRI can further correct
non-differential measurement errors that may exist in human annotations.
Focusing on text-as-outcome settings, I formally establish the identification
conditions and semiparametric efficient estimation strategies that enable
learning and leveraging such a low-dimensional representation. Simulation
studies and a real-world application demonstrate that SRI reduces standard
errors by over 50% when machine learning prediction accuracy is moderate and
provides valid inference even when human annotations contain non-differential
measurement errors.

Abstract: The combinatorial multi-armed bandit model is designed to maximize cumulative
rewards in the presence of uncertainty by activating a subset of arms in each
round. This paper is inspired by two critical applications in wireless
networks, where it's not only essential to maximize cumulative rewards but also
to guarantee fairness among arms (i.e., the minimum average reward required by
each arm) and ensure reward regularity (i.e., how often each arm receives the
reward). In this paper, we propose a parameterized regular and fair learning
algorithm to achieve these three objectives. In particular, the proposed
algorithm linearly combines virtual queue-lengths (tracking the fairness
violations), Time-Since-Last-Reward (TSLR) metrics, and Upper Confidence Bound
(UCB) estimates in its weight measure. Here, TSLR is similar to
age-of-information and measures the elapsed number of rounds since the last
time an arm received a reward, capturing the reward regularity performance, and
UCB estimates are utilized to balance the tradeoff between exploration and
exploitation in online learning. By exploring a key relationship between
virtual queue-lengths and TSLR metrics and utilizing several non-trivial
Lyapunov functions, we analytically characterize zero cumulative fairness
violation, reward regularity, and cumulative regret performance under our
proposed algorithm. These theoretical outcomes are verified by simulations
based on two real-world datasets.

Conclusion: 非局部神经正切核框架成功扩展了NTK理论的应用范围，使其能够适用于非光滑函数、随机估计器和更广泛的模型家族，为深度学习理论提供了新的分析工具。

Abstract: The Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) framework has provided deep insights into the
training dynamics of neural networks under gradient flow. However, it relies on
the assumption that the network is differentiable with respect to its
parameters, an assumption that breaks down when considering non-smooth target
functions or parameterized models exhibiting non-differentiable behavior. In
this work, we propose a Nonlocal Neural Tangent Kernel (NNTK) that replaces the
local gradient with a nonlocal interaction-based approximation in parameter
space. Nonlocal gradients are known to exist for a wider class of functions
than the standard gradient. This allows NTK theory to be extended to nonsmooth
functions, stochastic estimators, and broader families of models. We explore
both fixed-kernel and attention-based formulations of this nonlocal operator.
We illustrate the new formulation with numerical studies.

Result: 在相当精度下，PINNs训练时间比BEM长42倍，但评估速度快204倍；在训练域外泛化测试中，PINNs相对误差从0.0746增加到8.22，而BEM在扩展区域保持相似误差水平。

Abstract: Purpose - This study compares the Boundary Element Method (BEM) and
Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) for solving the two-dimensional
Helmholtz equation in wave scattering problems. The objective is to evaluate
the performance of both methods under the same conditions.
  Design/methodology/approach - We solve the Helmholtz equation using BEM and
PINNs for the same scattering problem. The PINNs are trained by minimizing the
residual of the governing equations and boundary conditions, with their
configuration determined through hyperparameter optimization, while the BEM is
applied using boundary discretization. Both methods are evaluated in terms of
solution accuracy, computation time, and generalization capacity.
  Findings - Numerical experiments were conducted by varying the number of
integration points for BEM and the number of layers and neurons per layer for
PINNs. Hyperparameter tuning provided further insight into suitable
configurations for wave scattering problems. At comparable accuracy, PINNs
produced consistent solutions but required training times approximately 42
times longer than BEM. However, once trained, PINNs achieved evaluation times
up to 204 times faster. The generalization capacity was also assessed outside
the PINN training domain, where the relative error increased from $7.46 \times
10^{-2}$ to 8.22, while BEM maintained a similar error level in the extended
region.
  Originality/value - This work presents a direct comparison between PINNs and
BEM for the Helmholtz equation. The analysis provides quantitative data on the
performance of both methods, supporting their selection in future research on
wave propagation problems and establishing future challenges and directions.

Abstract: Time-series forecasting and causal discovery are central in neuroscience, as
predicting brain activity and identifying causal relationships between neural
populations and circuits can shed light on the mechanisms underlying cognition
and disease. With the rise of foundation models, an open question is how they
compare to traditional methods for brain signal forecasting and causality
analysis, and whether they can be applied in a zero-shot setting. In this work,
we evaluate a foundation model against classical methods for inferring
directional interactions from spontaneous brain activity measured with
functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in humans. Traditional approaches
often rely on Wiener-Granger causality. We tested the forecasting ability of
the foundation model in both zero-shot and fine-tuned settings, and assessed
causality by comparing Granger-like estimates from the model with standard
Granger causality. We validated the approach using synthetic time series
generated from ground-truth causal models, including logistic map coupling and
Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes. The foundation model achieved competitive
zero-shot forecasting fMRI time series (mean absolute percentage error of 0.55
in controls and 0.27 in patients). Although standard Granger causality did not
show clear quantitative differences between models, the foundation model
provided a more precise detection of causal interactions.
  Overall, these findings suggest that foundation models offer versatility,
strong zero-shot performance, and potential utility for forecasting and causal

### [239] [Phi: Preference Hijacking in Multi-modal Large Language Models at Inference Time](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12521)
*Yifan Lan,Yuanpu Cao,Weitong Zhang,Lu Lin,Jinghui Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为Preference Hijacking (Phi)的新方法，通过精心优化的图像来操纵多模态大语言模型(MLLMs)的输出偏好，揭示了MLLMs的安全风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着多模态大语言模型在各个领域的广泛应用，其安全性问题日益凸显。研究发现MLLMs的输出偏好可以被恶意图像操纵，产生具有偏见但难以检测的响应。

Method: 提出了Preference Hijacking (Phi)方法，在推理时通过优化图像来劫持MLLMs的响应偏好，无需修改模型。还开发了通用劫持扰动，可嵌入不同图像中实现偏好操纵。

Result: 在各种任务上的实验结果表明，该方法能够有效操纵MLLMs的输出偏好，生成符合攻击者指定偏见的响应。

Conclusion: 该研究揭示了MLLMs存在新的安全风险，即输出偏好可被图像恶意操纵，需要开发相应的防御机制来应对这种隐蔽的攻击方式。

Abstract: Recently, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have gained significant
attention across various domains. However, their widespread adoption has also
raised serious safety concerns. In this paper, we uncover a new safety risk of
MLLMs: the output preference of MLLMs can be arbitrarily manipulated by
carefully optimized images. Such attacks often generate contextually relevant
yet biased responses that are neither overtly harmful nor unethical, making
them difficult to detect. Specifically, we introduce a novel method, Preference
Hijacking (Phi), for manipulating the MLLM response preferences using a
preference hijacked image. Our method works at inference time and requires no
model modifications. Additionally, we introduce a universal hijacking
perturbation -- a transferable component that can be embedded into different
images to hijack MLLM responses toward any attacker-specified preferences.
Experimental results across various tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach. The code for Phi is accessible at https://github.com/Yifan-Lan/Phi.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型经常产生看似合理但错误的输出，现有启发式方法如HallBayes缺乏形式化保证，需要开发具有理论保证的可靠性验证方法

Method: 开发了PAC-Bayes子伽马分析框架，扩展了标准Bernstein边界；提出了显式骨架敏感性定理；建立了假设违反下的故障模式保证；设计了基于变分方法的骨架构建原则

Result: 在六个数据集和多个模型家族上验证了假设，在相同风险水平下减少12-15%的弃权率，运行时开销低于20%（通过批处理可进一步降低）

Conclusion: 该研究首次建立了信息提升证书的全面理论框架，为大型语言模型的可靠性验证提供了形式化保证和实用工具

Abstract: Large language models often produce plausible but incorrect outputs. Existing
heuristics such as HallBayes lack formal guarantees. We develop the first
comprehensive theory of \emph{information-lift certificates} under selective
classification. Our contributions are: (i) a PAC-Bayes \emph{sub-gamma}
analysis extending beyond standard Bernstein bounds; (ii) explicit skeleton
sensitivity theorems quantifying robustness to misspecification; (iii)
failure-mode guarantees under assumption violations; and (iv) a principled
variational method for skeleton construction. Across six datasets and multiple
model families, we validate assumptions empirically, reduce abstention by
12--15\% at the same risk, and maintain runtime overhead below 20\% (further
reduced via batching).

TL;DR: GRAPHITE是一个通过图变换直接提升图同质性的新框架，首次显式地通过创建特征节点来改善异质图的消息传递，在异质图上显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GNN在异质图（连接节点特征或标签不相似）上表现不佳，甚至不如简单MLP，需要超越架构设计的新方法来直接解决异质性问题。

Method: 提出GRAPHITE框架，通过精确的同质性定义创建特征节点，促进具有相似特征的节点之间的同质性消息传递，直接提升图的同质性水平。

Result: 理论和实验证明GRAPHITE能显著提高异质图的同质性，图大小仅轻微增加。在挑战性数据集上大幅优于现有方法，在同质图上达到可比精度。

Conclusion: GRAPHITE开创了通过图变换直接改善图同质性的新范式，为解决图异质性挑战提供了简单有效的解决方案，在异质图上表现出卓越性能。

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as a powerful tool for modeling
graph-structured data. However, existing GNNs often struggle with heterophilic
graphs, where connected nodes tend to have dissimilar features or labels. While
numerous methods have been proposed to address this challenge, they primarily
focus on architectural designs without directly targeting the root cause of the
heterophily problem. These approaches still perform even worse than the
simplest MLPs on challenging heterophilic datasets. For instance, our
experiments show that 21 latest GNNs still fall behind the MLP on the Actor
dataset. This critical challenge calls for an innovative approach to addressing
graph heterophily beyond architectural designs. To bridge this gap, we propose
and study a new and unexplored paradigm: directly increasing the graph
homophily via a carefully designed graph transformation. In this work, we
present a simple yet effective framework called GRAPHITE to address graph
heterophily. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first method that
explicitly transforms the graph to directly improve the graph homophily.
Stemmed from the exact definition of homophily, our proposed GRAPHITE creates
feature nodes to facilitate homophilic message passing between nodes that share
similar features. Furthermore, we both theoretically and empirically show that
our proposed GRAPHITE significantly increases the homophily of originally
heterophilic graphs, with only a slight increase in the graph size. Extensive
experiments on challenging datasets demonstrate that our proposed GRAPHITE
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on heterophilic graphs while
achieving comparable accuracy with state-of-the-art methods on homophilic
graphs.

Motivation: 解决时间序列异常检测中灵敏度低和耗时高的问题

Method: 构建跨模态深度度量学习特征聚类模型，包含输入层、三元组选择层和损失函数计算层，使用平方欧氏距离计算聚类中心距离，采用随机梯度下降优化模型，利用vMF分布描述时间序列数据方向特性

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了时间序列异常检测的性能，在灵敏度、准确性和效率方面表现优异

Abstract: To effectively address the issues of low sensitivity and high time
consumption in time series anomaly detection, we propose an anomaly detection
method based on cross-modal deep metric learning. A cross-modal deep metric
learning feature clustering model is constructed, composed of an input layer, a
triplet selection layer, and a loss function computation layer. The squared
Euclidean distances between cluster centers are calculated, and a stochastic
gradient descent strategy is employed to optimize the model and classify
different time series features. The inner product of principal component
direction vectors is used as a metric for anomaly measurement. The von
Mises-Fisher (vMF) distribution is applied to describe the directional
characteristics of time series data, and historical data is used to train and
obtain evaluation parameters. By comparing the principal component direction
vector of actual time series data with the threshold, anomaly detection is
performed. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method accurately
classifies time series data with different attributes, exhibits high
sensitivity to anomalies, and achieves high detection accuracy, fast detection
speed, and strong robustness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Logit知识蒸馏虽然简单且无需中间特征对齐，但其决策过程可解释性有限，需要一种能够挖掘和传递可解释结构知识的方法。

Method: 使用解耦的局部logit表示的Gram矩阵，让学生模型学习潜在的语义结构模式，无需真实标签或特征空间对齐。

Result: 在基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，iCD在不同师生架构中均有效，特别是在细粒度分类任务中表现突出，比基线最高提升5.08%。

Conclusion: iCD是一种简单有效的可解释知识蒸馏方法，能够成功传递语义结构知识，在多个任务中展现出优越性能。

Abstract: Logit Knowledge Distillation has gained substantial research interest in
recent years due to its simplicity and lack of requirement for intermediate
feature alignment; however, it suffers from limited interpretability in its
decision-making process. To address this, we propose implicit Clustering
Distillation (iCD): a simple and effective method that mines and transfers
interpretable structural knowledge from logits, without requiring ground-truth
labels or feature-space alignment. iCD leverages Gram matrices over decoupled
local logit representations to enable student models to learn latent semantic
structural patterns. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate
the effectiveness of iCD across diverse teacher-student architectures, with
particularly strong performance in fine-grained classification tasks --
achieving a peak improvement of +5.08% over the baseline. The code is available

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有学习延迟方法对专家组成变化敏感且需要大量重新训练，需要一种更灵活、无需重新训练的人类-AI协作方案

Method: 使用共形预测器生成预测集来识别标签特定不确定性，通过可分离性准则选择最能区分剩余可能标签的专家

Result: 在CIFAR10-H和ImageNet16-H上准确率达到99.57%和99.40%，专家工作量减少高达11倍，在专家性能下降和低信息设置下保持稳健

Conclusion: 该方法为现实世界人类-AI协作提供了可扩展、无需重新训练的学习延迟替代方案

Abstract: AI systems often fail to deliver reliable predictions across all inputs,
prompting the need for hybrid human-AI decision-making. Existing Learning to
Defer (L2D) approaches address this by training deferral models, but these are
sensitive to changes in expert composition and require significant retraining
if experts change. We propose a training-free, model- and expert-agnostic
framework for expert deferral based on conformal prediction. Our method uses
the prediction set generated by a conformal predictor to identify
label-specific uncertainty and selects the most discriminative expert using a
segregativity criterion, measuring how well an expert distinguishes between the
remaining plausible labels. Experiments on CIFAR10-H and ImageNet16-H show that
our method consistently outperforms both the standalone model and the strongest
expert, with accuracies attaining $99.57\pm0.10\%$ and $99.40\pm0.52\%$, while
reducing expert workload by up to a factor of $11$. The method remains robust
under degraded expert performance and shows a gradual performance drop in
low-information settings. These results suggest a scalable, retraining-free
alternative to L2D for real-world human-AI collaboration.

Motivation: 现实商业场景中，模型往往不公开且计算资源有限，现有TDA方法依赖完整模型访问和高计算成本，限制了其实际应用。需要研究在受限条件下TDA的可行性。

Method: 系统研究不同访问约束级别下的TDA方法，利用代理模型等适当设计的解决方案，并验证未在目标数据集上训练的模型产生的归因分数的有效性。

Result: 发现在各种访问约束条件下仍可有效执行TDA，代理模型方法可行，且未训练模型的归因分数在多种任务中仍具有信息价值。

Conclusion: 研究为在现实受限环境中部署TDA提供了实用指导，提高了在有限访问条件下的可行性和效率，推动了TDA在更广泛实际场景中的应用。

Abstract: Training data attribution (TDA) plays a critical role in understanding the
influence of individual training data points on model predictions.
Gradient-based TDA methods, popularized by \textit{influence function} for
their superior performance, have been widely applied in data selection, data
cleaning, data economics, and fact tracing. However, in real-world scenarios
where commercial models are not publicly accessible and computational resources
are limited, existing TDA methods are often constrained by their reliance on
full model access and high computational costs. This poses significant
challenges to the broader adoption of TDA in practical applications.
  In this work, we present a systematic study of TDA methods under various
access and resource constraints. We investigate the feasibility of performing
TDA under varying levels of access constraints by leveraging appropriately
designed solutions such as proxy models. Besides, we demonstrate that
attribution scores obtained from models without prior training on the target
dataset remain informative across a range of tasks, which is useful for
scenarios where computational resources are limited. Our findings provide
practical guidance for deploying TDA in real-world environments, aiming to
improve feasibility and efficiency under limited access.

Motivation: 癌症是第二大死因，现有通路分析依赖耗时的手工湿实验室数据，需要开发高效、成本效益好的自动化分析方法。

Method: 从TCGA数据库提取突变序列，通过预处理算法筛选关键突变，使用RNN预测癌症严重程度，结合药物靶点数据库预测未来突变并推荐治疗方案。

Conclusion: 这是首个无需湿实验室工作的端到端癌症进展预测和治疗推荐框架，具有高效和成本效益优势。

Abstract: Despite significant medical advancements, cancer remains the second leading
cause of death, with over 600,000 deaths per year in the US. One emerging
field, pathway analysis, is promising but still relies on manually derived wet
lab data, which is time-consuming to acquire. This work proposes an efficient,
effective end-to-end framework for Artificial Intelligence (AI) based pathway
analysis that predicts both cancer severity and mutation progression, thus
recommending possible treatments. The proposed technique involves a novel
combination of time-series machine learning models and pathway analysis. First,
mutation sequences were isolated from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Database.
Then, a novel preprocessing algorithm was used to filter key mutations by
mutation frequency. This data was fed into a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)
that predicted cancer severity. Then, the model probabilistically used the RNN
predictions, information from the preprocessing algorithm, and multiple
drug-target databases to predict future mutations and recommend possible
treatments. This framework achieved robust results and Receiver Operating
Characteristic (ROC) curves (a key statistical metric) with accuracies greater
than 60%, similar to existing cancer diagnostics. In addition, preprocessing
played an instrumental role in isolating important mutations, demonstrating
that each cancer stage studied may contain on the order of a few-hundred key
driver mutations, consistent with current research. Heatmaps based on predicted
gene frequency were also generated, highlighting key mutations in each cancer.
Overall, this work is the first to propose an efficient, cost-effective
end-to-end framework for projecting cancer progression and providing possible
treatments without relying on expensive, time-consuming wet lab work.

Abstract: Multimodal data provides heterogeneous information for a holistic
understanding of the tumor microenvironment. However, existing AI models often
struggle to harness the rich information within multimodal data and extract
poorly generalizable representations. Here we present MICE (Multimodal data
Integration via Collaborative Experts), a multimodal foundation model that
effectively integrates pathology images, clinical reports, and genomics data
for precise pan-cancer prognosis prediction. Instead of conventional
multi-expert modules, MICE employs multiple functionally diverse experts to
comprehensively capture both cross-cancer and cancer-specific insights.
Leveraging data from 11,799 patients across 30 cancer types, we enhanced MICE's
generalizability by coupling contrastive and supervised learning. MICE
outperformed both unimodal and state-of-the-art multi-expert-based multimodal
models, demonstrating substantial improvements in C-index ranging from 3.8% to
11.2% on internal cohorts and 5.8% to 8.8% on independent cohorts,
respectively. Moreover, it exhibited remarkable data efficiency across diverse
clinical scenarios. With its enhanced generalizability and data efficiency,
MICE establishes an effective and scalable foundation for pan-cancer prognosis
prediction, holding strong potential to personalize tailored therapies and
improve treatment outcomes.

Method: 基于离散余弦变换的高能量集中特性，使用二进制掩码保留低频分量，通过频域分布对齐实现优化，并在损失函数中加入真实数据驱动的合成分类来提升低频分量质量

Result: 在5个图像和语音数据集上，FedFD在降低通信成本的同时实现了优于现有方法的性能。在CIFAR-10数据集上通信成本降低至少37.78%，性能提升10.88%

Conclusion: 频域感知的联邦学习方法FedFD能有效减少通信负担并提升模型性能，通过频域滤波处理解决了信息冗余和噪声问题

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) presents significant potential for collaborative
optimization without data sharing. Since synthetic data is sent to the server,
leveraging the popular concept of dataset distillation, this FL framework
protects real data privacy while alleviating data heterogeneity. However, such
methods are still challenged by the redundant information and noise in entire
spatial-domain designs, which inevitably increases the communication burden. In
this paper, we propose a novel Frequency-Domain aware FL method with
high-energy concentration (FedFD) to address this problem. Our FedFD is
inspired by the discovery that the discrete cosine transform predominantly
distributes energy to specific regions, referred to as high-energy
concentration. The principle behind FedFD is that low-energy like
high-frequency components usually contain redundant information and noise, thus
filtering them helps reduce communication costs and optimize performance. Our
FedFD is mathematically formulated to preserve the low-frequency components
using a binary mask, facilitating an optimal solution through frequency-domain
distribution alignment. In particular, real data-driven synthetic
classification is imposed into the loss to enhance the quality of the
low-frequency components. On five image and speech datasets, FedFD achieves
superior performance than state-of-the-art methods while reducing communication
costs. For example, on the CIFAR-10 dataset with Dirichlet coefficient $\alpha
= 0.01$, FedFD achieves a minimum reduction of 37.78\% in the communication
cost, while attaining a 10.88\% performance gain.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的SDM激活函数，在标准softmax基础上增加了相似性和距离感知，提高了神经网络的鲁棒性和可解释性，特别适用于选择性分类任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准softmax激活函数在处理协变量偏移和分布外输入时缺乏鲁棒性，且可解释性有限。需要一种能够同时考虑输出幅度、相似性和距离分布的激活函数来提高模型性能。

Method: 在softmax基础上引入相似性感知（正确预测的深度匹配）和距离感知（到训练分布的距离），形成相似性-距离-幅度（SDM）激活函数。通过密集匹配实现基于范例的可解释性。

Result: SDM激活函数比softmax对协变量偏移和分布外输入更加鲁棒，在高概率区域表现更好。能够对类别经验CDF进行分区，防止选择性分类中的低类别召回率。

Conclusion: SDM激活函数在选择性分类任务中优于softmax，即使考虑后校准方法也是如此，提供了更好的鲁棒性和可解释性。

Abstract: We introduce a more robust and interpretable formulation of the standard
softmax activation function commonly used with neural networks by adding
Similarity (i.e., correctly predicted depth-matches into training) awareness
and Distance-to-training-distribution awareness to the existing output
Magnitude (i.e., decision-boundary) awareness. When used as the final-layer
activation with language models, the resulting Similarity-Distance-Magnitude
(SDM) activation function is more robust than the softmax function to
co-variate shifts and out-of-distribution inputs in high-probability regions,
and provides interpretability-by-exemplar via dense matching. Complementing the
prediction-conditional estimates, the SDM activation enables a partitioning of
the class-wise empirical CDFs to guard against low class-wise recall among
selective classifications. These properties make it preferable for selective
classification, even when considering post-hoc calibration methods over the
softmax.

Method: TimeRep选择TSFM中最具信息量的中间层和补丁标记位置，构建参考表示集合并应用核心集策略减少规模，通过计算输入数据中间表示与参考集合的距离来检测异常，并包含适应机制处理概念漂移。

Result: 在包含250个单变量时间序列的UCR异常档案数据集上，TimeRep在广泛的基准测试中一致优于包括非深度学习、深度学习和基础模型方法在内的最先进基线方法。

Conclusion: TimeRep通过利用时间序列基础模型的中间层表示，提供了一种有效的时间序列异常检测方法，显著提升了检测性能并能够适应概念漂移。

Abstract: Detecting anomalies in time series data is essential for the reliable
operation of many real-world systems. Recently, time series foundation models
(TSFMs) have emerged as a powerful tool for anomaly detection. However,
existing methods typically rely on the final layer's representations of TSFMs,
computing the anomaly score as a reconstruction or forecasting error via a
task-specific head. Instead, we propose TimeRep, a novel anomaly detection
approach that leverages the intermediate layer's representations of TSFMs,
computing the anomaly score as the distance between these representations.
Given a pre-trained TSFM, TimeRep selects the intermediate layer and
patch-token position that yield the most informative representation. TimeRep
forms a reference collection of intermediate representations from the training
data and applies a core-set strategy to reduce its size while maintaining
distributional coverage. During inference, TimeRep computes the anomaly score
for incoming data by measuring the distance between its intermediate
representations and those of the collection. To address concept drift, TimeRep
integrates an adaptation mechanism that, at inference time, augments the
collection exclusively with non-redundant intermediate representations from
incoming data. We conducted extensive experiments on the UCR Anomaly Archive,
which contains 250 univariate time series. TimeRep consistently outperforms a
broad spectrum of state-of-the-art baselines, including non-DL, DL, and
foundation model-based methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出实例级随机化(ILR)方法来解决大语言模型评估中的不稳定性问题，通过为每个实例随机化所有影响因素并多次实验取平均，减少方差并增强模型比较的公平性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型评估存在不稳定性问题，随机因素(如few-shot示例)的微小变化会导致评分剧烈波动甚至模型排名变化。不同LLM对特定随机因素设置有不同偏好，固定设置可能导致不公平比较。

Method: 提出实例级随机化(ILR)方法：为每个测试实例随机化所有影响评估得分的因素，进行多次实验并报告平均得分，而不是在整个基准测试中使用固定设置。

Result: 理论分析和实证结果表明，ILR能够减少随机因素引起的方差和不公平比较，并且以不到一半的计算成本达到与先前方法相似的鲁棒性水平。

Conclusion: ILR方法有效解决了LLM评估中的不稳定性问题，通过随机化和平均化策略显著提高了评估的稳定性和公平性，同时降低了计算成本。

Abstract: Evaluations of large language models (LLMs) suffer from instability, where
small changes of random factors such as few-shot examples can lead to drastic
fluctuations of scores and even model rankings. Moreover, different LLMs can
have different preferences for a certain setting of random factors. As a
result, using a fixed setting of random factors, which is often adopted as the
paradigm of current evaluations, can lead to potential unfair comparisons
between LLMs. To mitigate the volatility of evaluations, we first theoretically
analyze the sources of variance induced by changes in random factors. Targeting
these specific sources, we then propose the instance-level randomization (ILR)
method to reduce variance and enhance fairness in model comparisons. Instead of
using a fixed setting across the whole benchmark in a single experiment, we
randomize all factors that affect evaluation scores for every single instance,
run multiple experiments and report the averaged score. Theoretical analyses
and empirical results demonstrate that ILR can reduce the variance and unfair
comparisons caused by random factors, as well as achieve similar robustness
level with less than half computational cost compared with previous methods.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) require careful alignment to balance competing
objectives - factuality, safety, conciseness, proactivity, and diversity.
Existing studies focus on individual techniques or specific dimensions, lacking
a holistic assessment of the inherent trade-offs. We propose a unified
evaluation framework that compares LLM alignment methods (PPO, DPO, ORPO, KTO)
across these five axes, using both in-distribution and out-of-distribution
datasets. Leveraging a specialized LLM-as-Judge prompt, validated through human
studies, we reveal that DPO and KTO excel in factual accuracy, PPO and DPO lead
in safety, and PPO best balances conciseness with proactivity. Our findings
provide insights into trade-offs of common alignment methods, guiding the

*Oliver Knitter,Dan Zhao,Stefan Leichenauer,Shravan Veerapaneni*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究了基于transformer的神经量子态(NQS)在量子化学应用中的缩放定律，发现模型大小与训练时间的关系高度依赖于损失度量和ansatz选择，与语言模型的线性关系不同。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着神经量子态(NQS)越来越多地采用基于大语言模型(LLM)的组件，需要理解NQS的缩放定律，以阐明NQS ansatze的可扩展性和最优性能-资源权衡。

Method: 识别基于transformer的NQS在二次量子化量子化学应用中的缩放定律，通过计算约束优化获得的参数曲线来分析性能与问题大小的关系。

Result: 发现模型大小与训练时间的关系高度依赖于损失度量(绝对误差和V-score)和ansatz选择，不遵循语言模型中发现的近似线性关系。

Conclusion: NQS的缩放行为与语言模型存在显著差异，表明需要针对量子计算应用开发专门的缩放定律和优化策略。

Abstract: Scaling laws have been used to describe how large language model (LLM)
performance scales with model size, training data size, or amount of
computational resources. Motivated by the fact that neural quantum states (NQS)
has increasingly adopted LLM-based components, we seek to understand NQS
scaling laws, thereby shedding light on the scalability and optimal
performance--resource trade-offs of NQS ansatze. In particular, we identify
scaling laws that predict the performance, as measured by absolute error and
V-score, for transformer-based NQS as a function of problem size in
second-quantized quantum chemistry applications. By performing analogous
compute-constrained optimization of the obtained parametric curves, we find
that the relationship between model size and training time is highly dependent
on loss metric and ansatz, and does not follow the approximately linear
relationship found for language models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 通过反转1000个正向推理样本构建高质量逆向推理数据集r1k，研究双向推理目标下SFT和DPO对模型对齐的影响，发现混合推理数据会产生冲突监督信号


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要关注单向监督微调，忽略了不同推理模式之间的复杂相互作用，需要研究双向推理对模型对齐的影响

Method: 构建逆向推理数据集r1k，分别在SFT和DPO框架下研究正向和逆向数据的混合训练效果

Result: SFT在r1k上相比s1k提升1.6%-6.8%准确率，但混合数据会削弱方向区分性，DPO能部分恢复区分性但会抑制次要推理路径

Conclusion: 混合推理数据引入冲突监督信号，需要开发鲁棒且方向感知的对齐策略

Abstract: Existing work has shown that o1-level performance can be achieved with
limited data distillation, but most existing methods focus on unidirectional
supervised fine-tuning (SFT), overlooking the intricate interplay between
diverse reasoning patterns. In this paper, we construct r1k, a high-quality
reverse reasoning dataset derived by inverting 1,000 forward examples from s1k,
and examine how SFT and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) affect alignment
under bidirectional reasoning objectives. SFT on r1k yields a 1.6%--6.8%
accuracy improvement over s1k across evaluated benchmarks. However, naively
mixing forward and reverse data during SFT weakens the directional distinction.
Although DPO can partially recover this distinction, it also suppresses less
preferred reasoning paths by shifting the probability mass toward irrelevant
outputs. These findings suggest that mixed reasoning data introduce conflicting
supervision signals, underscoring the need for robust and direction-aware
alignment strategies.

*Eric Cheng,Jie Cheng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ZTree是一个基于统计假设检验的新型决策树学习框架，用统计显著的子群识别替代传统的纯度分裂方法，通过交叉验证控制多重检验，仅需一个参数（z阈值）即可控制树复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CART决策树基于纯度分裂缺乏统计原理支持，ZTree旨在提供统计上更严谨的分裂准则，通过假设检验确保每个分裂都有统计显著性，提高模型的可解释性和统计可靠性。

Method: 在每个节点应用假设检验（z检验、t检验、Mann-Whitney U、log-rank等）评估候选子群与补集的差异显著性；使用交叉验证方法处理多重检验问题；仅需调整z阈值（本质上是p值）控制树复杂度。

Result: 在五个大规模UCI数据集上的实验表明，ZTree在低数据量情况下表现优异，相比CART能生成更简洁的树而不牺牲性能。

Conclusion: ZTree提供了一个统计基础坚实的决策树学习替代方案，通过假设检验和交叉验证的多重检验校正，实现了高效灵活的框架，参数调优直观简单。

Abstract: Decision trees are a commonly used class of machine learning models valued
for their interpretability and versatility, capable of both classification and
regression. We propose ZTree, a novel decision tree learning framework that
replaces CART's traditional purity based splitting with statistically
principled subgroup identification. At each node, ZTree applies hypothesis
testing (e.g., z-tests, t-tests, Mann-Whitney U, log-rank) to assess whether a
candidate subgroup differs meaningfully from the complement. To adjust for the
complication of multiple testing, we employ a cross-validation-based approach
to determine if further node splitting is needed. This robust stopping
criterion eliminates the need for post-pruning and makes the test threshold
(z-threshold) the only parameter for controlling tree complexity. Because of
the simplicity of the tree growing procedure, once a detailed tree is learned
using the most lenient z-threshold, all simpler trees can be derived by simply
removing nodes that do not meet the larger z-thresholds. This makes parameter
tuning intuitive and efficient. Furthermore, this z-threshold is essentially a
p-value, allowing users to easily plug in appropriate statistical tests into
our framework without adjusting the range of parameter search. Empirical
evaluation on five large-scale UCI datasets demonstrates that ZTree
consistently delivers strong performance, especially at low data regimes.
Compared to CART, ZTree also tends to grow simpler trees without sacrificing
performance. ZTree introduces a statistically grounded alternative to
traditional decision tree splitting by leveraging hypothesis testing and a
cross-validation approach to multiple testing correction, resulting in an
efficient and flexible framework.

*Jiadong Hong,Lei Liu,Xinyu Bian,Wenjie Wang,Zhaoyang Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了Soft Graph Transformer (SGT)用于MIMO检测，结合图注意力机制和消息传递，支持软输入软输出，接近最大似然性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统最大似然检测计算复杂度高，消息传递算法依赖大系统渐近性和随机矩阵假设，现有Transformer检测器无法利用MIMO因子图结构和解码器软信息

Method: 将消息传递直接集成到图感知注意力机制中，通过软输入嵌入支持解码器信息更新，实现有效的软输出生成

Result: 作为独立检测器，SGT接近最大似然性能，超越之前的Transformer方法

Conclusion: SGT成功克服了现有方法的局限性，在保持计算效率的同时实现了优异的检测性能

Abstract: We propose the Soft Graph Transformer (SGT), a Soft-Input-Soft-Output neural
architecture tailored for MIMO detection. While Maximum Likelihood (ML)
detection achieves optimal accuracy, its prohibitive exponential complexity
renders it impractical for real-world systems. Conventional message passing
algorithms offer tractable alternatives but rely on large-system asymptotics
and random matrix assumptions, both of which break down under practical
implementations. Prior Transformer-based detectors, on the other hand, fail to
incorporate the MIMO factor graph structure and cannot utilize decoder-side
soft information, limiting their standalone performance and their applicability
in iterative detection-decoding (IDD). To overcome these limitations, SGT
integrates message passing directly into a graph-aware attention mechanism and
supports decoder-informed updates through soft-input embeddings. This design
enables effective soft-output generation while preserving computational
efficiency. As a standalone detector, SGT closely approaches ML performance and
surpasses prior Transformer-based approaches.

Conclusion: 该方法成功地将专有代理的关键能力移植到开源模型中，证明了通过系统化训练可以弥补开源模型在复杂推理任务中的不足。

Abstract: Transcending human cognitive limitations represents a critical frontier in
LLM training. Proprietary agentic systems like DeepResearch have demonstrated
superhuman capabilities on extremely complex information-seeking benchmarks
such as BrowseComp, a feat previously unattainable. We posit that their success
hinges on a sophisticated reasoning pattern absent in open-source models: the
ability to systematically reduce extreme uncertainty when navigating vast
information landscapes. Based on this insight, we introduce WebSailor, a
complete post-training methodology designed to instill this crucial capability.
Our approach involves generating novel, high-uncertainty tasks through
structured sampling and information obfuscation, RFT cold start, and an
efficient agentic RL training algorithm, Duplicating Sampling Policy
Optimization (DUPO). With this integrated pipeline, WebSailor significantly
outperforms all open-source agents in complex information-seeking tasks,
matching proprietary agents' performance and closing the capability gap.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种双层个性化联邦学习框架，用于在基础模型上进行联邦微调，通过客户端个性化微调和基于任务向量的服务器个性化聚合来解决小规模用户群体和专业化场景下的数据稀缺问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦基础模型需要在小规模新用户或专业场景下进行微调，这些场景数据有限且非独立同分布，个性化与联邦学习之间的权衡变得更加敏感。

Method: 采用双层个性化框架：客户端使用私有数据进行个性化微调，服务器使用基于任务向量测量的相似用户进行个性化聚合，从而获得群体个性化信息并减少不相关或兴趣冲突客户端的干扰。

Result: 在基准数据集上的广泛实验分析证明了所提出算法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该框架能够有效解决联邦基础模型在小规模用户群体微调时的个性化与联邦学习权衡问题，通过双层个性化机制提升模型性能。

Abstract: Federated foundation models represent a new paradigm to jointly fine-tune
pre-trained foundation models across clients. It is still a challenge to
fine-tune foundation models for a small group of new users or specialized
scenarios, which typically involve limited data compared to the large-scale
data used in pre-training. In this context, the trade-off between
personalization and federation becomes more sensitive. To tackle these, we
proposed a bi-level personalization framework for federated fine-tuning on
foundation models. Specifically, we conduct personalized fine-tuning on the
client-level using its private data, and then conduct a personalized
aggregation on the server-level using similar users measured by client-specific
task vectors. Given the personalization information gained from client-level
fine-tuning, the server-level personalized aggregation can gain group-wise
personalization information while mitigating the disturbance of irrelevant or
interest-conflict clients with non-IID data. The effectiveness of the proposed
algorithm has been demonstrated by extensive experimental analysis in benchmark
datasets.

Conclusion: NORA方法有效利用常规临床数据进行CKD风险分层，为门诊环境中的早期肾病检测提供了可行的解决方案

Abstract: Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) affects millions of people worldwide, yet its
early detection remains challenging, especially in outpatient settings where
laboratory-based renal biomarkers are often unavailable. In this work, we
investigate the predictive potential of routinely collected non-renal clinical
variables for CKD classification, including sociodemographic factors, comorbid
conditions, and urinalysis findings. We introduce the Nephrology-Oriented
Representation leArning (NORA) approach, which combines supervised contrastive
learning with a nonlinear Random Forest classifier. NORA first derives
discriminative patient representations from tabular EHR data, which are then
used for downstream CKD classification. We evaluated NORA on a clinic-based EHR
dataset from Riverside Nephrology Physicians. Our results demonstrated that
NORA improves class separability and overall classification performance,
particularly enhancing the F1-score for early-stage CKD. Additionally, we
assessed the generalizability of NORA on the UCI CKD dataset, demonstrating its
effectiveness for CKD risk stratification across distinct patient cohorts.

Method: 建立基于Fisher信息矩阵曲率参数空间的通用正则化框架，提出基于模型当前学习状态的无偏在线曲率近似方法，直接估计正则化项而无需显式计算和存储Fisher信息矩阵。

Result: 在三个图数据集上的大量实验表明，该方法显著优于现有的基于正则化的方法，在稳定性（保留旧知识）和可塑性（获取新知识）之间实现了更好的平衡。

Conclusion: 提出的在线曲率近似方法能够更好地捕捉学习新任务时的损失景观，同时保留从先前任务中学到的知识，为图持续学习提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Graph continual learning (GCL) aims to learn from a continuous sequence of
graph-based tasks. Regularization methods are vital for preventing catastrophic
forgetting in GCL, particularly in the challenging replay-free,
class-incremental setting, where each task consists of a set of unique classes.
In this work, we first establish a general regularization framework for GCL
based on the curved parameter space induced by the Fisher information matrix
(FIM). We show that the dominant Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC) and its
variants are a special case within this framework, using a diagonal
approximation of the empirical FIM based on parameters from previous tasks. To
overcome their limitations, we propose a new unbiased online curvature
approximation of the full FIM based on the model's current learning state. Our
method directly estimates the regularization term in an online manner without
explicitly evaluating and storing the FIM itself. This enables the model to
better capture the loss landscape during learning new tasks while retaining the
knowledge learned from previous tasks. Extensive experiments on three graph
datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing
regularization-based methods, achieving a superior trade-off between stability
(retaining old knowledge) and plasticity (acquiring new knowledge).

<details>

Motivation: 数字生态系统的发展使金融部门面临不断演变的滥用和犯罪策略，传统基于规则的系统缺乏检测复杂或协同犯罪行为的适应性，需要分析参与者互动来发现可疑活动。

Method: 四步预处理框架：(i)提取图结构，(ii)考虑数据时间性管理大节点集，(iii)检测社区，(iv)应用自动标注策略生成弱标签；然后实现三种不同的Graph Autoencoder变种进行拓扑模式区分。

Conclusion: 该方法通过图机器学习和网络分析成功解决了传统金融数据集稀疏、无标签的挑战，为金融犯罪检测提供了有效的拓扑模式识别解决方案。

Abstract: The rise of digital ecosystems has exposed the financial sector to evolving
abuse and criminal tactics that share operational knowledge and techniques both
within and across different environments (fiat-based, crypto-assets, etc.).
Traditional rule-based systems lack the adaptability needed to detect
sophisticated or coordinated criminal behaviors (patterns), highlighting the
need for strategies that analyze actors' interactions to uncover suspicious
activities and extract their modus operandi. For this reason, in this work, we
propose an approach that integrates graph machine learning and network analysis
to improve the detection of well-known topological patterns within
transactional graphs. However, a key challenge lies in the limitations of
traditional financial datasets, which often provide sparse, unlabeled
information that is difficult to use for graph-based pattern analysis.
Therefore, we firstly propose a four-step preprocessing framework that involves
(i) extracting graph structures, (ii) considering data temporality to manage
large node sets, (iii) detecting communities within, and (iv) applying
automatic labeling strategies to generate weak ground-truth labels. Then, once
the data is processed, Graph Autoencoders are implemented to distinguish among
the well-known topological patterns. Specifically, three different GAE variants
are implemented and compared in this analysis. Preliminary results show that
this pattern-focused, topology-driven method is effective for detecting complex
financial crime schemes, offering a promising alternative to conventional
rule-based detection systems.

Support Vector Machines (SVM) algorithms have been mathematically rewritten to
reduce training time and increase accuracy in classification models. With the
applied mathematical improvements, training time has been reduced by
approximately 2 times for SVM on small datasets and by around 800 times on

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a promising paradigm for enabling
collaborative machine learning while preserving data privacy, making it
particularly suitable for Internet of Things (IoT) environments. However,
resource-constrained IoT devices face significant challenges due to limited
energy,unreliable communication channels, and the impracticality of assuming
infinite blocklength transmission. This paper proposes a federated learning
framework for IoT networks that integrates finite blocklength transmission,
model quantization, and an error-aware aggregation mechanism to enhance energy
efficiency and communication reliability. The framework also optimizes uplink
transmission power to balance energy savings and model performance. Simulation
results demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly reduces energy
consumption by up to 75\% compared to a standard FL model, while maintaining
robust model accuracy, making it a viable solution for FL in real-world IoT
scenarios with constrained resources. This work paves the way for efficient and
reliable FL implementations in practical IoT deployments. Index Terms:

Abstract: Projection-based safety filters, which modify unsafe actions by mapping them
to the closest safe alternative, are widely used to enforce safety constraints
in reinforcement learning (RL). Two integration strategies are commonly
considered: Safe environment RL (SE-RL), where the safeguard is treated as part
of the environment, and safe policy RL (SP-RL), where it is embedded within the
policy through differentiable optimization layers. Despite their practical
relevance in safety-critical settings, a formal understanding of their
differences is lacking. In this work, we present a theoretical comparison of
SE-RL and SP-RL. We identify a key distinction in how each approach is affected
by action aliasing, a phenomenon in which multiple unsafe actions are projected
to the same safe action, causing information loss in the policy gradients. In
SE-RL, this effect is implicitly approximated by the critic, while in SP-RL, it
manifests directly as rank-deficient Jacobians during backpropagation through
the safeguard. Our contributions are threefold: (i) a unified formalization of
SE-RL and SP-RL in the context of actor-critic algorithms, (ii) a theoretical
analysis of their respective policy gradient estimates, highlighting the role
of action aliasing, and (iii) a comparative study of mitigation strategies,
including a novel penalty-based improvement for SP-RL that aligns with
established SE-RL practices. Empirical results support our theoretical
predictions, showing that action aliasing is more detrimental for SP-RL than
for SE-RL. However, with appropriate improvement strategies, SP-RL can match or
outperform improved SE-RL across a range of environments. These findings
provide actionable insights for choosing and refining projection-based safe RL
methods based on task characteristics.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in
language understanding and reasoning, yet they remain limited when tackling
real-world tasks that require up-to-date knowledge, precise operations, or
specialized tool use. To address this, we propose Tool-R1, a reinforcement
learning framework that enables LLMs to perform general, compositional, and
multi-step tool use by generating executable Python code. Tool-R1 supports
integration of user-defined tools and standard libraries, with variable sharing
across steps to construct coherent workflows. An outcome-based reward function,
combining LLM-based answer judgment and code execution success, guides policy
optimization. To improve training efficiency, we maintain a dynamic sample
queue to cache and reuse high-quality trajectories, reducing the overhead of
costly online sampling. Experiments on the GAIA benchmark show that Tool-R1
substantially improves both accuracy and robustness, achieving about 10\% gain
over strong baselines, with larger improvements on complex multi-step tasks.
These results highlight the potential of Tool-R1 for enabling reliable and
efficient tool-augmented reasoning in real-world applications. Our code will be

Abstract: TimeCluster is a visual analytics technique for discovering structure in long
multivariate time series by projecting overlapping windows of data into a
low-dimensional space. We show that, when Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is
chosen as the dimensionality reduction technique, this procedure is
mathematically equivalent to classical linear subspace identification
(block-Hankel matrix plus Singular Vector Decomposition (SVD)). In both
approaches, the same low-dimensional linear subspace is extracted from the time
series data. We first review the TimeCluster method and the theory of subspace
system identification. Then we show that forming the sliding-window matrix of a
time series yields a Hankel matrix, so applying PCA (via SVD) to this matrix
recovers the same principal directions as subspace identification. Thus the
cluster coordinates from TimeCluster coincide with the subspace identification
methods. We present experiments on synthetic and real dynamical signals
confirming that the two embeddings coincide. Finally, we explore and discuss
future opportunities enabled by this equivalence, including forecasting from
the identified state space, streaming/online extensions, incorporating and
visualising external inputs and robust techniques for displaying underlying
trends in corrupted data.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 可逆深度平衡模型（RevDEQs）通过引入可逆性解决了传统DEQs梯度计算近似的问题，实现了精确梯度计算，在语言建模和图像分类任务上达到最先进性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度平衡模型（DEQs）虽然通过单层迭代替代多层结构在大规模任务中表现出色，但其梯度计算是近似的，导致训练不稳定，需要正则化或大量函数评估来修正

Method: 引入可逆深度平衡模型（RevDEQs），通过可逆性设计实现了精确的梯度计算，无需正则化，且比传统DEQs需要更少的函数评估

Result: RevDEQs在语言建模和图像分类任务上实现了最先进的性能，超越了可比较的隐式和显式模型

Conclusion: 可逆深度平衡模型通过精确梯度计算解决了传统DEQs的训练稳定性问题，在保持性能优势的同时显著减少了计算需求

Abstract: Deep Equilibrium Models (DEQs) are an interesting class of implicit model
where the model output is implicitly defined as the fixed point of a learned
function. These models have been shown to outperform explicit (fixed-depth)
models in large-scale tasks by trading many deep layers for a single layer that
is iterated many times. However, gradient calculation through DEQs is
approximate. This often leads to unstable training dynamics and requires
regularisation or many function evaluations to fix. Here, we introduce
Reversible Deep Equilibrium Models (RevDEQs) that allow for exact gradient
calculation, no regularisation and far fewer function evaluations than DEQs. We
show that RevDEQs achieve state-of-the-art performance on language modelling
and image classification tasks against comparable implicit and explicit models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种软梯度提升框架，在提升过程中嵌入可学习的线性特征变换，特别适用于高维数据稀缺场景，通过端到端优化提升性能并避免过拟合。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对高维数据稀缺场景中特征选择与提升过程分离的问题，希望通过端到端优化同时学习特征变换和提升模型，提高性能并避免过拟合。

Method: 在每个提升迭代中训练软决策树并同时学习线性输入特征变换Q，可扩展到非线性变换，实现特征选择/变换与提升的联合优化。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上验证了方法的有效性，能够高效提升性能，避免过拟合，并在数据稀缺情况下发现最相关的输入表示。

Conclusion: 该框架成功实现了特征变换与梯度提升的端到端联合优化，在高维数据稀缺场景中表现出色，代码已公开以支持复现和后续研究。

Abstract: We propose a soft gradient boosting framework for sequential regression that
embeds a learnable linear feature transform within the boosting procedure. At
each boosting iteration, we train a soft decision tree and learn a linear input
feature transform Q together. This approach is particularly advantageous in
high-dimensional, data-scarce scenarios, as it discovers the most relevant
input representations while boosting. We demonstrate, using both synthetic and
real-world datasets, that our method effectively and efficiently increases the
performance by an end-to-end optimization of feature selection/transform and
boosting while avoiding overfitting. We also extend our algorithm to
differentiable non-linear transforms if overfitting is not a problem. To
support reproducibility and future work, we share our code publicly.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了Sy-FAR方法，通过在对抗鲁棒性优化中引入对称性概念来解决机器学习系统中的公平性问题，特别是在人脸识别等安全关键应用中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的对抗鲁棒性方法通常会导致不公平的鲁棒性——某些类别或群体更容易受到攻击。在现实世界的公平关键任务中，实现完美的公平性往往不可行，因此需要更可行的对称性概念。

Method: 开发了Sy-FAR技术，通过鼓励攻击对称性（即从类别i到j的攻击成功率与从j到i的攻击成功率相同）来优化对抗鲁棒性和公平性。

Result: 在五个数据集和三种模型架构上的广泛评估显示，Sy-FAR相比最先进方法显著提高了公平对抗鲁棒性，运行速度更快且结果更一致，同时减少了目标类别的脆弱性。

Conclusion: 对称性是一个更可行的公平性概念，Sy-FAR方法在提高对抗鲁棒性的同时有效解决了公平性问题，特别是在安全关键的应用场景中。

Abstract: Security-critical machine-learning (ML) systems, such as face-recognition
systems, are susceptible to adversarial examples, including real-world
physically realizable attacks. Various means to boost ML's adversarial
robustness have been proposed; however, they typically induce unfair
robustness: It is often easier to attack from certain classes or groups than
from others. Several techniques have been developed to improve adversarial
robustness while seeking perfect fairness between classes. Yet, prior work has
focused on settings where security and fairness are less critical. Our insight
is that achieving perfect parity in realistic fairness-critical tasks, such as
face recognition, is often infeasible -- some classes may be highly similar,
leading to more misclassifications between them. Instead, we suggest that
seeking symmetry -- i.e., attacks from class $i$ to $j$ would be as successful
as from $j$ to $i$ -- is more tractable. Intuitively, symmetry is a desirable
because class resemblance is a symmetric relation in most domains.
Additionally, as we prove theoretically, symmetry between individuals induces
symmetry between any set of sub-groups, in contrast to other fairness notions
where group-fairness is often elusive. We develop Sy-FAR, a technique to
encourage symmetry while also optimizing adversarial robustness and extensively
evaluate it using five datasets, with three model architectures, including
against targeted and untargeted realistic attacks. The results show Sy-FAR
significantly improves fair adversarial robustness compared to state-of-the-art
methods. Moreover, we find that Sy-FAR is faster and more consistent across
runs. Notably, Sy-FAR also ameliorates another type of unfairness we discover
in this work -- target classes that adversarial examples are likely to be
classified into become significantly less vulnerable after inducing symmetry.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于概率框架的时空动态建模方法，整合神经ODE、图神经网络和神经过程，用于从稀疏观测中重建和预测心脏运动轨迹。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法难以处理心脏运动这类结构化时空动态系统中的不确定性、时间连续性和解剖结构特征，需要一种能够从稀疏观测中进行准确重建和外推的统一框架。

Method: 使用时空多路图表示动态系统，通过GNN参数化的向量场建模潜在轨迹，基于节点和边级别的稀疏上下文观测推断潜在初始状态和控制变量的分布。

Result: 在三个合成动力系统和两个真实心脏影像数据集上验证，能够准确重建轨迹并从单周期观测外推未来心脏周期，在ACDC分类任务上达到99%准确率，在UK Biobank房颤检测中达到67%准确率。

Conclusion: 该方法为分析心脏运动提供了灵活的方法，为基于图学习的结构化生物医学时空序列数据分析奠定了基础。

Abstract: We present a probabilistic framework for modeling structured spatiotemporal
dynamics from sparse observations, focusing on cardiac motion. Our approach
integrates neural ordinary differential equations (NODEs), graph neural
networks (GNNs), and neural processes into a unified model that captures
uncertainty, temporal continuity, and anatomical structure. We represent
dynamic systems as spatiotemporal multiplex graphs and model their latent
trajectories using a GNN-parameterized vector field. Given the sparse context
observations at node and edge levels, the model infers a distribution over
latent initial states and control variables, enabling both interpolation and
extrapolation of trajectories. We validate the method on three synthetic
dynamical systems (coupled pendulum, Lorenz attractor, and Kuramoto
oscillators) and two real-world cardiac imaging datasets - ACDC (N=150) and UK
Biobank (N=526) - demonstrating accurate reconstruction, extrapolation, and
disease classification capabilities. The model accurately reconstructs
trajectories and extrapolates future cardiac cycles from a single observed
cycle. It achieves state-of-the-art results on the ACDC classification task (up
to 99% accuracy), and detects atrial fibrillation in UK Biobank subjects with
competitive performance (up to 67% accuracy). This work introduces a flexible
approach for analyzing cardiac motion and offers a foundation for graph-based
learning in structured biomedical spatiotemporal time-series data.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了BAPFL，这是首个专门针对原型联邦学习(PFL)框架的后门攻击方法，通过原型投毒策略和触发器优化机制，在保持主任务精度的同时显著提高了攻击成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 原型联邦学习(PFL)因其独特的原型学习机制和本地数据异质性，对现有后门攻击具有天然抵抗力。为了深入探索PFL的安全性，需要开发专门针对PFL框架的后门攻击方法。

Method: BAPFL整合了原型投毒策略和触发器优化机制。原型投毒策略操纵全局原型轨迹，误导良性客户端的原型训练；触发器优化机制为每个潜在目标标签学习独特且隐蔽的触发器，使触发样本原型与目标标签全局原型对齐。

Result: 在多个数据集和PFL变体上的实验结果表明，BAPFL相比传统后门攻击实现了35%-75%的攻击成功率提升，同时保持了主任务精度。

Conclusion: BAPFL在PFL中表现出高效性、隐蔽性和适应性，揭示了PFL框架在安全方面需要进一步关注的问题。

Abstract: Prototype-based federated learning (PFL) has emerged as a promising paradigm
to address data heterogeneity problems in federated learning, as it leverages
mean feature vectors as prototypes to enhance model generalization. However,
its robustness against backdoor attacks remains largely unexplored. In this
paper, we identify that PFL is inherently resistant to existing backdoor
attacks due to its unique prototype learning mechanism and local data
heterogeneity. To further explore the security of PFL, we propose BAPFL, the
first backdoor attack method specifically designed for PFL frameworks. BAPFL
integrates a prototype poisoning strategy with a trigger optimization
mechanism. The prototype poisoning strategy manipulates the trajectories of
global prototypes to mislead the prototype training of benign clients, pushing
their local prototypes of clean samples away from the prototypes of
trigger-embedded samples. Meanwhile, the trigger optimization mechanism learns
a unique and stealthy trigger for each potential target label, and guides the
prototypes of trigger-embedded samples to align closely with the global
prototype of the target label. Experimental results across multiple datasets
and PFL variants demonstrate that BAPFL achieves a 35\%-75\% improvement in
attack success rate compared to traditional backdoor attacks, while preserving
main task accuracy. These results highlight the effectiveness, stealthiness,
and adaptability of BAPFL in PFL.

### [273] [Causal Discovery via Quantile Partial Effect](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12981)
*Yikang Chen,Xingzhe Sun,Dehui Du*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了基于分位数部分效应(QPE)的因果发现方法，通过分析观测分布的形状不对称性来识别因果方向，无需考虑噪声机制或马尔可夫假设，并在多变量因果发现中利用Fisher信息确定因果顺序。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统功能因果模型(FCMs)需要假设噪声机制，而本文旨在直接从观测分布的形状特性中识别因果关系，提供更一般化的可识别性理论。

Method: 利用QPE统计量，假设因果对效应的QPE位于有限线性空间中，通过基函数检验估计的QPE来区分因果方向；在多变量情况下，利用QPE与得分函数的紧密联系，使用Fisher信息作为统计量来确定因果顺序。

Result: 理论证明在QPE有限线性跨度假设下，因果关系可从观测分布中识别；实验在大量双变量因果发现数据集上验证了方法的有效性，并在多变量合成和真实数据集上证实了使用Fisher信息识别因果顺序的可行性。

Conclusion: QPE为基础的方法提供了新的因果发现框架，直接从观测层面利用分布形状不对称性，避免了传统FCMs的机制假设限制，为因果发现提供了更通用的理论基础和实用工具。

Abstract: Quantile Partial Effect (QPE) is a statistic associated with conditional
quantile regression, measuring the effect of covariates at different levels.
Our theory demonstrates that when the QPE of cause on effect is assumed to lie
in a finite linear span, cause and effect are identifiable from their
observational distribution. This generalizes previous identifiability results
based on Functional Causal Models (FCMs) with additive, heteroscedastic noise,
etc. Meanwhile, since QPE resides entirely at the observational level, this
parametric assumption does not require considering mechanisms, noise, or even
the Markov assumption, but rather directly utilizes the asymmetry of shape
characteristics in the observational distribution. By performing basis function
tests on the estimated QPE, causal directions can be distinguished, which is
empirically shown to be effective in experiments on a large number of bivariate
causal discovery datasets. For multivariate causal discovery, leveraging the
close connection between QPE and score functions, we find that Fisher
Information is sufficient as a statistical measure to determine causal order
when assumptions are made about the second moment of QPE. We validate the
feasibility of using Fisher Information to identify causal order on multiple
synthetic and real-world multivariate causal discovery datasets.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一种简单有效的后训练策略，显著提升ECG基础模型ECGFounder在PTB-XL基准上的性能表现，在AUROC和AUPRC指标上均有明显改进，且具有更好的稳定性和样本效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ECG基础模型虽然流行，但其临床适用性常受限于与任务特定模型之间的性能差距，主要原因是缺乏有效的后训练策略。

Method: 提出一种后训练方法，包含随机深度和预览线性探测等关键组件，应用于经过700多万ECG记录预训练的ECGFounder模型。

Result: 在PTB-XL基准上，相比基线微调策略，AUROC提升1.2%-3.3%，AUPRC提升5.3%-20.9%；仅使用10%训练数据时，AUROC提升9.1%，AUPRC提升34.9%。

Conclusion: 后训练策略能有效提升ECG基础模型的性能，这项工作有望推动ECG领域基础模型的持续发展。

Abstract: ECG foundation models are increasingly popular due to their adaptability
across various tasks. However, their clinical applicability is often limited by
performance gaps compared to task-specific models, even after pre-training on
large ECG datasets and fine-tuning on target data. This limitation is likely
due to the lack of an effective post-training strategy. In this paper, we
propose a simple yet effective post-training approach to enhance ECGFounder, a
state-of-the-art ECG foundation model pre-trained on over 7 million ECG
recordings. Experiments on the PTB-XL benchmark show that our approach improves
the baseline fine-tuning strategy by 1.2%-3.3% in macro AUROC and 5.3%-20.9% in
macro AUPRC. Additionally, our method outperforms several recent
state-of-the-art approaches, including task-specific and advanced
architectures. Further evaluation reveals that our method is more stable and
sample-efficient compared to the baseline, achieving a 9.1% improvement in
macro AUROC and a 34.9% improvement in macro AUPRC using just 10% of the
training data. Ablation studies identify key components, such as stochastic
depth and preview linear probing, that contribute to the enhanced performance.
These findings underscore the potential of post-training strategies to improve
ECG foundation models, and we hope this work will contribute to the continued
development of foundation models in the ECG domain.

Abstract: We present a new method to visualize data ensembles by constructing
structured probabilistic representations in latent spaces, i.e.,
lower-dimensional representations of spatial data features. Our approach
transforms the spatial features of an ensemble into a latent space through
feature space conversion and unsupervised learning using a variational
autoencoder (VAE). The resulting latent spaces follow multivariate standard
Gaussian distributions, enabling analytical computation of confidence intervals
and density estimation of the probabilistic distribution that generates the
data ensemble. Preliminary results on a weather forecasting ensemble
demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of our method.

Conclusion: ReTrack是一种快速有效的扩散模型数据遗忘方法，通过重要性采样和轨迹重定向技术，成功解决了数据记忆化问题，同时保持了模型的生成能力。

Abstract: Diffusion models excel at generating high-quality, diverse images but suffer
from training data memorization, raising critical privacy and safety concerns.
Data unlearning has emerged to mitigate this issue by removing the influence of
specific data without retraining from scratch. We propose ReTrack, a fast and
effective data unlearning method for diffusion models. ReTrack employs
importance sampling to construct a more efficient fine-tuning loss, which we
approximate by retaining only dominant terms. This yields an interpretable
objective that redirects denoising trajectories toward the $k$-nearest
neighbors, enabling efficient unlearning while preserving generative quality.
Experiments on MNIST T-Shirt, CelebA-HQ, CIFAR-10, and Stable Diffusion show
that ReTrack achieves state-of-the-art performance, striking the best trade-off
between unlearning strength and generation quality preservation.

Abstract: Despite the remarkable progress in the synthesis speed and fidelity of neural
vocoders, their high energy consumption remains a critical barrier to practical
deployment on computationally restricted edge devices. Spiking Neural Networks
(SNNs), widely recognized for their high energy efficiency due to their
event-driven nature, offer a promising solution for low-resource scenarios. In
this paper, we propose Spiking Vocos, a novel spiking neural vocoder with
ultra-low energy consumption, built upon the efficient Vocos framework. To
mitigate the inherent information bottleneck in SNNs, we design a Spiking
ConvNeXt module to reduce Multiply-Accumulate (MAC) operations and incorporate
an amplitude shortcut path to preserve crucial signal dynamics. Furthermore, to
bridge the performance gap with its Artificial Neural Network (ANN)
counterpart, we introduce a self-architectural distillation strategy to
effectively transfer knowledge. A lightweight Temporal Shift Module is also
integrated to enhance the model's ability to fuse information across the
temporal dimension with negligible computational overhead. Experiments
demonstrate that our model achieves performance comparable to its ANN
counterpart, with UTMOS and PESQ scores of 3.74 and 3.45 respectively, while
consuming only 14.7% of the energy. The source code is available at

Abstract: Discovering valid and meaningful mathematical equations from observed data
plays a crucial role in scientific discovery. While this task, symbolic
regression, remains challenging due to the vast search space and the trade-off
between accuracy and complexity. In this paper, we introduce DiffuSR, a
pre-training framework for symbolic regression built upon a continuous-state
diffusion language model. DiffuSR employs a trainable embedding layer within
the diffusion process to map discrete mathematical symbols into a continuous
latent space, modeling equation distributions effectively. Through iterative
denoising, DiffuSR converts an initial noisy sequence into a symbolic equation,
guided by numerical data injected via a cross-attention mechanism. We also
design an effective inference strategy to enhance the accuracy of the
diffusion-based equation generator, which injects logit priors into genetic
programming. Experimental results on standard symbolic regression benchmarks
demonstrate that DiffuSR achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art
autoregressive methods and generates more interpretable and diverse
mathematical expressions.

Conclusion: 从粗到细的课程学习是训练高分辨率CFD图神经网络的有效策略，既能加速收敛又能提升模型性能。

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as powerful surrogates for
mesh-based computational fluid dynamics (CFD), but training them on
high-resolution unstructured meshes with hundreds of thousands of nodes remains
prohibitively expensive. We study a \emph{coarse-to-fine curriculum} that
accelerates convergence by first training on very coarse meshes and then
progressively introducing medium and high resolutions (up to \(3\times10^5\)
nodes). Unlike multiscale GNN architectures, the model itself is unchanged;
only the fidelity of the training data varies over time. We achieve comparable
generalization accuracy while reducing total wall-clock time by up to 50\%.
Furthermore, on datasets where our model lacks the capacity to learn the
underlying physics, using curriculum learning enables it to break through
plateaus.

Abstract: Graph heterophily poses a formidable challenge to the performance of
Message-passing Graph Neural Networks (MP-GNNs). The familiar low-pass filters
like Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) face performance degradation, which
can be attributed to the blending of the messages from dissimilar neighboring
nodes. The performance of the low-pass filters on heterophilic graphs still
requires an in-depth analysis. In this context, we update the heterophilic
graphs by adding a number of self-loops and parallel edges. We observe that
eigenvalues of the graph Laplacian decrease and increase respectively by
increasing the number of self-loops and parallel edges. We conduct several
studies regarding the performance of GCN on various benchmark heterophilic
networks by adding either self-loops or parallel edges. The studies reveal that
the GCN exhibited either increasing or decreasing performance trends on adding
self-loops and parallel edges. In light of the studies, we established
connections between the graph spectra and the performance trends of the
low-pass filters on the heterophilic graphs. The graph spectra characterize the
essential intrinsic properties of the input graph like the presence of
connected components, sparsity, average degree, cluster structures, etc. Our
work is adept at seamlessly evaluating graph spectrum and properties by
observing the performance trends of the low-pass filters without pursuing the
costly eigenvalue decomposition. The theoretical foundations are also discussed
to validate the impact of adding self-loops and parallel edges on the graph
spectrum.

Method: 构建包含时间敏感数据获取、简单历史查询和复杂历史调查三个任务的基准测试，采用70位金融专家标注和多阶段质量保证流程，涵盖全球和大中华区市场。

Result: Grok 4在全局子集上表现最佳，接近专家水平准确率；DouBao在大中华区子集领先。实验表明配备网络搜索和金融插件能显著提升性能，模型和工具的国家来源对表现有重要影响。

Conclusion: FinSearchComp通过模拟真实分析师任务并提供端到端评估，为复杂金融搜索和推理提供了专业、高难度的测试平台。

Abstract: Search has emerged as core infrastructure for LLM-based agents and is widely
viewed as critical on the path toward more general intelligence. Finance is a
particularly demanding proving ground: analysts routinely conduct complex,
multi-step searches over time-sensitive, domain-specific data, making it ideal
for assessing both search proficiency and knowledge-grounded reasoning. Yet no
existing open financial datasets evaluate data searching capability of
end-to-end agents, largely because constructing realistic, complicated tasks
requires deep financial expertise and time-sensitive data is hard to evaluate.
We present FinSearchComp, the first fully open-source agent benchmark for
realistic, open-domain financial search and reasoning. FinSearchComp comprises
three tasks -- Time-Sensitive Data Fetching, Simple Historical Lookup, and
Complex Historical Investigation -- closely reproduce real-world financial
analyst workflows. To ensure difficulty and reliability, we engage 70
professional financial experts for annotation and implement a rigorous
multi-stage quality-assurance pipeline. The benchmark includes 635 questions
spanning global and Greater China markets, and we evaluate 21 models (products)
on it. Grok 4 (web) tops the global subset, approaching expert-level accuracy.
DouBao (web) leads on the Greater China subset. Experimental analyses show that
equipping agents with web search and financial plugins substantially improves
results on FinSearchComp, and the country origin of models and tools impact
performance significantly.By aligning with realistic analyst tasks and
providing end-to-end evaluation, FinSearchComp offers a professional,
high-difficulty testbed for complex financial search and reasoning.

Motivation: 研究生成概率分类器中的个体公平性问题，探索后验推断对私有特征扰动的鲁棒性，旨在缓解传统公平性与准确性之间的权衡

Method: 使用贝叶斯网络作为生成模型，在14个具有公平性问题的基准数据集上进行实验，将鲁棒性分析问题重新表述为辅助马尔可夫随机场中的最可能解释任务

Result: 实验证实了鲁棒性与预测准确性之间的相关性假设，鲁棒性更强的实例更可能被准确分类

Conclusion: 研究结果为缓解公平性与准确性之间的传统权衡提供了新方向，通过鲁棒性分析可以同时改善分类器的公平性和准确性

Abstract: We investigate individual fairness in generative probabilistic classifiers by
analysing the robustness of posterior inferences to perturbations in private
features. Building on established results in robustness analysis, we
hypothesise a correlation between robustness and predictive accuracy,
specifically, instances exhibiting greater robustness are more likely to be
classified accurately. We empirically assess this hypothesis using a benchmark
of fourteen datasets with fairness concerns, employing Bayesian networks as the
underlying generative models. To address the computational complexity
associated with robustness analysis over multiple private features with
Bayesian networks, we reformulate the problem as a most probable explanation
task in an auxiliary Markov random field. Our experiments confirm the
hypothesis about the correlation, suggesting novel directions to mitigate the
traditional trade-off between fairness and accuracy.

Abstract: CoVariance Neural Networks (VNNs) perform graph convolutions on the empirical
covariance matrix of signals defined over finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces,
motivated by robustness and transferability properties. Yet, little is known
about how these arguments extend to infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces. In
this work, we take a first step by introducing a novel convolutional learning
framework for signals defined over infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces,
centered on the (empirical) covariance operator. We constructively define
Hilbert coVariance Filters (HVFs) and design Hilbert coVariance Networks (HVNs)
as stacks of HVF filterbanks with nonlinear activations. We propose a
principled discretization procedure, and we prove that empirical HVFs can
recover the Functional PCA (FPCA) of the filtered signals. We then describe the
versatility of our framework with examples ranging from multivariate
real-valued functions to reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. Finally, we
validate HVNs on both synthetic and real-world time-series classification
tasks, showing robust performance compared to MLP and FPCA-based classifiers.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文通过理论分析和实验验证，证明了元学习相比全类训练具有更紧的泛化边界，在有限熵条件下更高效，对标签噪声和异构任务更鲁棒，并提出了MINO元学习框架来提升无监督性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 近期研究表明全类训练策略训练的模型在少样本分类任务中可以达到与元学习相当的性能，为了证明元学习的价值，需要建立公平比较的熵限制监督设置。

Method: 通过理论分析和实验验证元学习的泛化边界优势；提出MINO元学习框架，使用DBSCAN自适应聚类算法构建无监督任务，采用基于稳定性的元缩放器来增强对标签噪声的鲁棒性。

Result: 元学习在有限熵条件下更高效，对标签噪声和异构任务更鲁棒；MINO框架在多个无监督少样本和零样本任务中表现出有效性。

Conclusion: 元学习相比全类训练具有理论优势，特别是在无监督任务中表现更佳，MINO框架成功验证了元学习在无监督场景下的价值。

Abstract: Meta-learning is a powerful paradigm for tackling few-shot tasks. However,
recent studies indicate that models trained with the whole-class training
strategy can achieve comparable performance to those trained with meta-learning
in few-shot classification tasks. To demonstrate the value of meta-learning, we
establish an entropy-limited supervised setting for fair comparisons. Through
both theoretical analysis and experimental validation, we establish that
meta-learning has a tighter generalization bound compared to whole-class
training. We unravel that meta-learning is more efficient with limited entropy
and is more robust to label noise and heterogeneous tasks, making it
well-suited for unsupervised tasks. Based on these insights, We propose MINO, a
meta-learning framework designed to enhance unsupervised performance. MINO
utilizes the adaptive clustering algorithm DBSCAN with a dynamic head for
unsupervised task construction and a stability-based meta-scaler for robustness
against label noise. Extensive experiments confirm its effectiveness in
multiple unsupervised few-shot and zero-shot tasks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出TRUST-FS方法，通过张量分解框架同时处理多视图无监督特征选择、缺失变量填补和视图权重学习，利用主观逻辑获取可信的跨视图相似性信息


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多视图无监督特征选择方法存在三个主要挑战：1) 只能处理缺失视图，无法处理更一般的缺失变量场景；2) 填补和特征选择过程分离，忽略相互作用；3) 缺失数据导致相似性图不准确

Method: 提出基于自适应加权CP分解的张量分解框架，结合主观逻辑获取可信的跨视图相似性信息，统一进行特征选择、缺失变量填补和视图权重学习

Result: 综合实验结果表明该方法在效果和性能上优于现有最先进方法

Conclusion: TRUST-FS方法能够有效解决多视图数据中缺失变量的问题，通过统一的张量分解框架实现了特征选择、填补和权重学习的协同优化

Abstract: Multi-view unsupervised feature selection (MUFS), which selects informative
features from multi-view unlabeled data, has attracted increasing research
interest in recent years. Although great efforts have been devoted to MUFS,
several challenges remain: 1) existing methods for incomplete multi-view data
are limited to handling missing views and are unable to address the more
general scenario of missing variables, where some features have missing values
in certain views; 2) most methods address incomplete data by first imputing
missing values and then performing feature selection, treating these two
processes independently and overlooking their interactions; 3) missing data can
result in an inaccurate similarity graph, which reduces the performance of
feature selection. To solve this dilemma, we propose a novel MUFS method for
incomplete multi-view data with missing variables, termed Tensorized Reliable
UnSupervised mulTi-view Feature Selection (TRUST-FS). TRUST-FS introduces a new
adaptive-weighted CP decomposition that simultaneously performs feature
selection, missing-variable imputation, and view weight learning within a
unified tensor factorization framework. By utilizing Subjective Logic to
acquire trustworthy cross-view similarity information, TRUST-FS facilitates
learning a reliable similarity graph, which subsequently guides feature
selection and imputation. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness and superiority of our method over state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合双向时序图注意力变换器(B-TGAT)的时间分布式混合U-Net自编码器，用于高维多变量时空气候数据的聚类，在三个数据集上表现出优越的聚类分离性和时序稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高维多变量时空气候数据的聚类具有挑战性，传统方法难以同时捕捉局部和全局时序关系并保持空间上下文。复杂的时间依赖性、演化的空间交互和非平稳动态使得传统聚类方法效果有限。

Method: 使用时间分布式混合U-Net自编码器，编码器和解码器配备ConvLSTM2D模块提取联合时空特征，通过跳跃连接保持多尺度空间细节。在瓶颈处集成B-TGAT，结合基于图的空间建模和注意力驱动的时序编码，实现自适应时序邻居加权和长短程依赖捕捉。

Result: 在三个不同的时空气候数据集上的实验表明，该方法相比最先进的基线方法具有优越的聚类分离性、时序稳定性，并且与已知的气候转变对齐。

Conclusion: ConvLSTM2D、U-Net跳跃连接和B-TGAT的集成提升了时序聚类性能，同时为复杂的时空变异性提供了可解释的见解，推动了方法学发展和气候科学应用。

Abstract: Clustering high-dimensional multivariate spatiotemporal climate data is
challenging due to complex temporal dependencies, evolving spatial
interactions, and non-stationary dynamics. Conventional clustering methods,
including recurrent and convolutional models, often struggle to capture both
local and global temporal relationships while preserving spatial context. We
present a time-distributed hybrid U-Net autoencoder that integrates a
Bi-directional Temporal Graph Attention Transformer (B-TGAT) to guide efficient
temporal clustering of multidimensional spatiotemporal climate datasets. The
encoder and decoder are equipped with ConvLSTM2D modules that extract joint
spatial--temporal features by modeling localized dynamics and spatial
correlations over time, and skip connections that preserve multiscale spatial
details during feature compression and reconstruction. At the bottleneck,
B-TGAT integrates graph-based spatial modeling with attention-driven temporal
encoding, enabling adaptive weighting of temporal neighbors and capturing both
short and long-range dependencies across regions. This architecture produces
discriminative latent embeddings optimized for clustering. Experiments on three
distinct spatiotemporal climate datasets demonstrate superior cluster
separability, temporal stability, and alignment with known climate transitions
compared to state-of-the-art baselines. The integration of ConvLSTM2D, U-Net
skip connections, and B-TGAT enhances temporal clustering performance while
providing interpretable insights into complex spatiotemporal variability,
advancing both methodological development and climate science applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决深度学习中持续学习面临的灾难性遗忘问题，特别是当面对新数据分布时，现有参数高效微调方法在动态学习场景和长任务序列中面临扩展性挑战。

Method: 提出分层适配器合并(HAM)框架，维护固定组集来分层整合新适配器，为每个任务训练低秩适配器和重要性标量，基于适配器相似性动态分组，在组内进行修剪、缩放和合并适配器。

Result: 在三个视觉基准测试上的广泛实验表明，HAM显著优于最先进的方法，特别是在任务数量增加时表现更加突出。

Conclusion: HAM框架通过动态适配器合并有效解决了持续学习中的扩展性和灾难性遗忘问题，为处理长任务序列提供了高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Continual learning is an essential capability of human cognition, yet it
poses significant challenges for current deep learning models. The primary
issue is that new knowledge can interfere with previously learned information,
causing the model to forget earlier knowledge in favor of the new, a phenomenon
known as catastrophic forgetting. Although large pre-trained models can
partially mitigate forgetting by leveraging their existing knowledge and
over-parameterization, they often struggle when confronted with novel data
distributions. Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods, such as LoRA,
enable efficient adaptation to new knowledge. However, they still face
challenges in scaling to dynamic learning scenarios and long sequences of
tasks, as maintaining one adapter per task introduces complexity and increases
the potential for interference. In this paper, we introduce Hierarchical
Adapters Merging (HAM), a novel framework that dynamically combines adapters
from different tasks during training. This approach enables HAM to scale
effectively, allowing it to manage more tasks than competing baselines with
improved efficiency. To achieve this, HAM maintains a fixed set of groups that
hierarchically consolidate new adapters. For each task, HAM trains a low-rank
adapter along with an importance scalar, then dynamically groups tasks based on
adapter similarity. Within each group, adapters are pruned, scaled and merge,
facilitating transfer learning between related tasks. Extensive experiments on
three vision benchmarks show that HAM significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art methods, particularly as the number of tasks increases.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为DA-FPS的新型采样方法，用于在标注数据有限的情况下选择训练集，通过最小化加权填充距离来降低回归模型的预测误差上界


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在机器学习回归任务中，由于计算限制或标注成本高昂，标注训练数据有限，因此需要从无标注数据中选择合适的训练集来平衡性能与效率

Method: 推导了Lipschitz连续回归模型预测误差的上界，该上界线性依赖于训练集的加权填充距离。提出了密度感知最远点采样(DA-FPS)方法，该方法能够近似最小化加权填充距离的数据驱动估计

Result: 在两个回归模型和三个数据集上的实验表明，DA-FPS相比其他采样策略显著降低了平均绝对预测误差

Conclusion: DA-FPS是一种有效的被动且模型无关的采样方法，仅基于数据特征表示就能选择出高质量的训练集，在标注数据有限的情况下能显著提升回归模型的性能

Abstract: We focus on training machine learning regression models in scenarios where
the availability of labeled training data is limited due to computational
constraints or high labeling costs. Thus, selecting suitable training sets from
unlabeled data is essential for balancing performance and efficiency. For the
selection of the training data, we focus on passive and model-agnostic sampling
methods that only consider the data feature representations. We derive an upper
bound for the expected prediction error of Lipschitz continuous regression
models that linearly depends on the weighted fill distance of the training set,
a quantity we can estimate simply by considering the data features. We
introduce "Density-Aware Farthest Point Sampling" (DA-FPS), a novel sampling
method. We prove that DA-FPS provides approximate minimizers for a data-driven
estimation of the weighted fill distance, thereby aiming at minimizing our
derived bound. We conduct experiments using two regression models across three
datasets. The results demonstrate that DA-FPS significantly reduces the mean
absolute prediction error compared to other sampling strategies.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FOSSIL是一个统一的样本权重学习框架，通过单一可解释公式整合类别不平衡校正、难度感知课程学习、数据增强惩罚和预热动态，在数据不平衡和小样本场景中优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决数据不平衡和小样本场景中的挑战，现有方法如过采样、焦点损失或元加权等要么脆弱要么复杂，需要统一的解决方案。

Method: 提出FOSSIL框架，通过样本敏感重要性学习，将类别不平衡校正、难度感知课程学习、数据增强惩罚和预热动态集成到单一公式中，无需架构改动。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上相比ERM、课程学习和元加权基线方法获得了一致的经验增益，并提供了基于遗憾的理论保证。

Conclusion: FOSSIL提供了一个理论保证的统一框架，有效解决了不平衡和小数据场景中的学习问题，具有很好的实用性和解释性。

Abstract: Imbalanced and small data regimes are pervasive in domains such as rare
disease imaging, genomics, and disaster response, where labeled samples are
scarce and naive augmentation often introduces artifacts. Existing solutions
such as oversampling, focal loss, or meta-weighting address isolated aspects of
this challenge but remain fragile or complex. We introduce FOSSIL (Flexible
Optimization via Sample Sensitive Importance Learning), a unified weighting
framework that seamlessly integrates class imbalance correction,
difficulty-aware curricula, augmentation penalties, and warmup dynamics into a
single interpretable formula. Unlike prior heuristics, the proposed framework
provides regret-based theoretical guarantees and achieves consistent empirical
gains over ERM, curriculum, and meta-weighting baselines on synthetic and
real-world datasets, while requiring no architectural changes.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的联邦学习后门攻击方法OBA，使用分布外数据作为中毒样本和触发器，并开发了SoDa技术提高隐蔽性。同时提出了BNGuard防御方法，利用批归一化层统计偏差检测恶意模型更新。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统后门攻击需要可见触发器和物理修改目标对象，攻击场景受限。为了解决这个局限性，需要开发更隐蔽、更实用的联邦学习后门攻击方法。

Method: OBA使用分布外(OOD)数据作为中毒样本和触发器；SoDa通过正则化恶意本地模型的幅度和方向，使其与良性版本对齐以逃避检测；BNGuard防御方法利用OOD数据导致批归一化层运行统计显著偏差的特性来识别恶意更新。

Result: OBA能有效规避最先进的防御方法，同时保持主任务的高准确率；BNGuard在各种设置下的广泛实验显示其能有效防御SoDa攻击。

Conclusion: 该工作提出了OBA这种更实用的联邦学习后门攻击原型，并开发了相应的SoDa隐蔽技术和BNGuard防御方法，为联邦学习系统安全提供了新的攻防视角。

Abstract: Traditional backdoor attacks in federated learning (FL) operate within
constrained attack scenarios, as they depend on visible triggers and require
physical modifications to the target object, which limits their practicality.
To address this limitation, we introduce a novel backdoor attack prototype for
FL called the out-of-distribution (OOD) backdoor attack ($\mathtt{OBA}$), which
uses OOD data as both poisoned samples and triggers simultaneously. Our
approach significantly broadens the scope of backdoor attack scenarios in FL.
To improve the stealthiness of $\mathtt{OBA}$, we propose $\mathtt{SoDa}$,
which regularizes both the magnitude and direction of malicious local models
during local training, aligning them closely with their benign versions to
evade detection. Empirical results demonstrate that $\mathtt{OBA}$ effectively
circumvents state-of-the-art defenses while maintaining high accuracy on the
main task.
  To address this security vulnerability in the FL system, we introduce
$\mathtt{BNGuard}$, a new server-side defense method tailored against
$\mathtt{SoDa}$. $\mathtt{BNGuard}$ leverages the observation that OOD data
causes significant deviations in the running statistics of batch normalization
layers. This allows $\mathtt{BNGuard}$ to identify malicious model updates and
exclude them from aggregation, thereby enhancing the backdoor robustness of FL.
Extensive experiments across various settings show the effectiveness of
$\mathtt{BNGuard}$ on defending against $\mathtt{SoDa}$. The code is available
at https://github.com/JiiahaoXU/SoDa-BNGuard.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SPO是一种单流策略优化方法，通过持久化KL自适应值跟踪器和全局优势归一化，解决了GRPO等组基方法的退化组问题和可扩展性限制，在数学推理任务上取得了显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的组基方法（如GRPO）存在退化组频繁消除学习信号、同步障碍阻碍可扩展性等问题，需要一种更稳定高效的策略优化方法。

Method: SPO采用持久化KL自适应值跟踪器替代每组基线，并在批次内全局归一化优势，提供稳定低方差的学习信号，无需分组从而实现更高吞吐量。

Result: 在Qwen3-8B模型上，SPO比GRPO收敛更平滑准确率更高，在五个数学基准测试中平均maj@32提升3.4个百分点，其中BRUMO 25提升7.3pp，AIME 25提升4.4pp。

Conclusion: SPO的成功表明通过基本原理而非架构变通来驱动LLM推理进步是可行的，为LLM策略优化提供了更稳健高效的路径。

Abstract: We revisit policy-gradient optimization for Large Language Models (LLMs) from
a single-stream perspective. Prevailing group-based methods like GRPO reduce
variance with on-the-fly baselines but suffer from critical flaws: frequent
degenerate groups erase learning signals, and synchronization barriers hinder
scalability. We introduce Single-stream Policy Optimization (SPO), which
eliminates these issues by design. SPO replaces per-group baselines with a
persistent, KL-adaptive value tracker and normalizes advantages globally across
the batch, providing a stable, low-variance learning signal for every sample.
Being group-free, SPO enables higher throughput and scales effectively in
long-horizon or tool-integrated settings where generation times vary.
Furthermore, the persistent value tracker naturally enables an adaptive
curriculum via prioritized sampling. Experiments using Qwen3-8B show that SPO
converges more smoothly and attains higher accuracy than GRPO, while
eliminating computation wasted on degenerate groups. Ablation studies confirm
that SPO's gains stem from its principled approach to baseline estimation and
advantage normalization, offering a more robust and efficient path for LLM
reasoning. Across five hard math benchmarks with Qwen3 8B, SPO improves the
average maj@32 by +3.4 percentage points (pp) over GRPO, driven by substantial
absolute point gains on challenging datasets, including +7.3 pp on BRUMO 25,
+4.4 pp on AIME 25, +3.3 pp on HMMT 25, and achieves consistent relative gain
in pass@$k$ across the evaluated $k$ values. SPO's success challenges the
prevailing trend of adding incidental complexity to RL algorithms, highlighting
a path where fundamental principles, not architectural workarounds, drive the
next wave of progress in LLM reasoning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种将重复推理片段转换为可重用"行为"的方法，通过LLM的元认知分析创建行为手册，在推理时提供相关行为或通过监督微调蒸馏到参数中，显著减少了推理标记数量并提高了准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在解决多步问题时经常重复推导相同的中间步骤，导致标记使用量和延迟增加，上下文窗口饱和限制了探索能力。需要一种机制来避免重复推理，提高效率。

Method: 通过模型的元认知分析将重复推理片段转换为简洁可重用的"行为"（名称+指令），存储在行为手册中。在推理时提供相关行为上下文，或通过监督微调将行为蒸馏到模型参数中。

Result: 1) 行为条件推理：推理标记减少达46%，准确率匹配或超过基线；2) 行为引导自改进：无参数更新情况下准确率比基线提高10%；3) 行为条件SFT：比普通SFT更有效地将非推理模型转换为推理模型。

Conclusion: 将缓慢的推导过程转换为快速的过程提示，使LLM能够记住如何推理，而不仅仅是记住结论，这种方法显著提高了推理效率和效果。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) now solve multi-step problems by emitting
extended chains of thought. During the process, they often re-derive the same
intermediate steps across problems, inflating token usage and latency. This
saturation of the context window leaves less capacity for exploration. We study
a simple mechanism that converts recurring reasoning fragments into concise,
reusable "behaviors" (name + instruction) via the model's own metacognitive
analysis of prior traces. These behaviors are stored in a "behavior handbook"
which supplies them to the model in-context at inference or distills them into
parameters via supervised fine-tuning. This approach achieves improved
test-time reasoning across three different settings - 1) Behavior-conditioned
inference: Providing the LLM relevant behaviors in-context during reasoning
reduces number of reasoning tokens by up to 46% while matching or improving
baseline accuracy; 2) Behavior-guided self-improvement: Without any parameter
updates, the model improves its own future reasoning by leveraging behaviors
from its own past problem solving attempts. This yields up to 10% higher
accuracy than a naive critique-and-revise baseline; and 3) Behavior-conditioned
SFT: SFT on behavior-conditioned reasoning traces is more effective at
converting non-reasoning models into reasoning models as compared to vanilla
SFT. Together, these results indicate that turning slow derivations into fast
procedural hints enables LLMs to remember how to reason, not just what to
conclude.

TL;DR: NoRA是首个直接调整预训练Transformer模型中非线性激活函数的参数高效微调框架，通过可学习有理函数和结构化低秩更新，仅需0.4%参数就能达到或超越全参数微调效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的参数高效微调方法主要调整权重矩阵而保持激活函数固定，限制了模型适应能力。作者认为激活函数也应作为模型适配的一等公民进行优化。

Method: NoRA用可学习有理函数替换固定激活函数，对分子和分母系数应用结构化低秩更新，采用分组设计实现局部适应和稳定性提升。

Result: 在CIFAR数据集上达到或超越全参数微调性能（+0.17%-0.27%），仅更新0.02M参数；与LoRA结合（NoRA++）在相同训练预算下表现更优；在LLaMA3-8B指令微调中持续提升生成质量，MMLU平均增益0.3%-0.8%。

Conclusion: 激活空间调优是权重基PEFT的互补且高度参数高效的替代方案，确立了激活函数作为模型适配的重要对象。

Abstract: Existing parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods primarily adapt
weight matrices while keeping activation functions fixed. We introduce
\textbf{NoRA}, the first PEFT framework that directly adapts nonlinear
activation functions in pretrained transformer-based models. NoRA replaces
fixed activations with learnable rational functions and applies structured
low-rank updates to numerator and denominator coefficients, with a group-wise
design that localizes adaptation and improves stability at minimal cost. On
vision transformers trained on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, NoRA matches or exceeds
full fine-tuning while updating only 0.4\% of parameters (0.02M), achieving
accuracy gains of +0.17\% and +0.27\%. When combined with LoRA
(\textbf{NoRA++}), it outperforms LoRA and DoRA under matched training budgets
by adding fewer trainable parameters. On LLaMA3-8B instruction tuning, NoRA++
consistently improves generation quality, yielding average MMLU gains of
+0.3\%--0.8\%, including +1.6\% on STEM (Alpaca) and +1.3\% on OpenOrca. We
further show that NoRA constrains adaptation to a low-dimensional functional
subspace, implicitly regularizing update magnitude and direction. These results
establish activation-space tuning as a complementary and highly
parameter-efficient alternative to weight-based PEFT, positioning activation
functions as first-class objects for model adaptation.

TL;DR: 提出了一种后处理单前向传播框架SPC-UQ，通过分割点分析(SPA)同时捕捉任意性和认知不确定性，无需重新训练预训练模型，在回归和分类任务中实现了高效的不确定性量化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有不确定性量化方法要么计算成本高（如贝叶斯或集成方法），要么只能提供部分、任务特定的估计（如单前向传播技术），需要一种既高效又能全面捕捉不确定性的方法。

Method: 使用分割点分析(SPA)将预测残差分解为上下子集，计算每侧的平均绝对残差(MARs)。通过自一致性差异分数(SDS)进行细粒度认知估计。回归任务中使用分位数回归获得预测区间，分类任务中基于SPA校准softmax输出。

Result: 在多个回归和分类基准测试中，该方法匹配或超越了多种最先进的不确定性量化方法，同时计算开销极小。

Conclusion: SPC-UQ框架提供了一种高效、全面的不确定性量化解决方案，能够同时处理任意性和认知不确定性，适用于各种深度学习任务。

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification (UQ) is vital for trustworthy deep learning, yet
existing methods are either computationally intensive, such as Bayesian or
ensemble methods, or provide only partial, task-specific estimates, such as
single-forward-pass techniques. In this paper, we propose a post-hoc
single-forward-pass framework that jointly captures aleatoric and epistemic
uncertainty without modifying or retraining pretrained models. Our method
applies \emph{Split-Point Analysis} (SPA) to decompose predictive residuals
into upper and lower subsets, computing \emph{Mean Absolute Residuals} (MARs)
on each side. We prove that, under ideal conditions, the total MAR equals the
harmonic mean of subset MARs; deviations define a novel \emph{Self-consistency
Discrepancy Score} (SDS) for fine-grained epistemic estimation across
regression and classification. For regression, side-specific quantile
regression yields prediction intervals with improved empirical coverage, which
are further calibrated via SDS. For classification, when calibration data are
available, we apply SPA-based calibration identities to adjust the softmax
outputs and then compute predictive entropy on these calibrated probabilities.
Extensive experiments on diverse regression and classification benchmarks
demonstrate that our framework matches or exceeds several state-of-the-art UQ
methods while incurring minimal overhead.

*Jiahao Zhang,Xiaobing Pei,Zhaokun Zhong,Wenqiang Hao,Zhenghao Tang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出JANUS框架，通过局部特征流形对齐和全局结构语义一致性，解决图神经网络节点注入攻击中的隐蔽性问题，显著提升攻击效果和隐蔽性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图神经网络节点注入攻击方法主要依赖间接代理指标实现隐蔽性，缺乏对注入内容本质特征的考虑，且仅关注局部结构模仿，存在局部短视问题。

Method: 提出双约束隐蔽节点注入框架JANUS：局部层面采用特征流形对齐策略实现几何一致性；全局层面引入结构化潜变量并通过最大化互信息确保注入结构与原始图语义模式一致；将注入攻击建模为序列决策过程，使用强化学习优化。

Result: 在多个标准数据集上的实验表明，JANUS框架在攻击效果和隐蔽性方面均显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: JANUS框架通过同时考虑局部和全局结构一致性，有效解决了节点注入攻击中的隐蔽性问题，为图神经网络安全提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across
various applications, yet they are vulnerable to sophisticated adversarial
attacks, particularly node injection attacks. The success of such attacks
heavily relies on their stealthiness, the ability to blend in with the original
graph and evade detection. However, existing methods often achieve stealthiness
by relying on indirect proxy metrics, lacking consideration for the fundamental
characteristics of the injected content, or focusing only on imitating local
structures, which leads to the problem of local myopia. To overcome these
limitations, we propose a dual-constraint stealthy node injection framework,
called Joint Alignment of Nodal and Universal Structures (JANUS). At the local
level, we introduce a local feature manifold alignment strategy to achieve
geometric consistency in the feature space. At the global level, we incorporate
structured latent variables and maximize the mutual information with the
generated structures, ensuring the injected structures are consistent with the
semantic patterns of the original graph. We model the injection attack as a
sequential decision process, which is optimized by a reinforcement learning
agent. Experiments on multiple standard datasets demonstrate that the JANUS
framework significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of both attack
effectiveness and stealthiness.

### [296] [LLMs for energy and macronutrients estimation using only text data from 24-hour dietary recalls: a parameter-efficient fine-tuning experiment using a 10-shot prompt](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13268)
*Rodrigo M Carrillo-Larco*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 开源大语言模型通过思维链提示和参数高效微调，仅基于食物文本描述就能准确预测能量和宏量营养素含量，为低负担的文本饮食监测工具提供了可能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的AI营养估算工具大多依赖图像输入，但大语言模型是否能仅通过食物文本描述准确预测营养值尚不清楚。如果有效，这种方法可以实现无需照片的简单饮食监测。

Method: 使用NHANES青少年24小时饮食回顾数据，采用10样本思维链提示的开源量化LLM来预测能量和五种宏量营养素，并应用参数高效微调(PEFT)来评估预测准确性。

Result: 基础LLM预测效果差（能量MAE为652.08，Lin's CCC<0.46），但经过微调的模型表现显著改善（能量MAE降至171.34-190.90，Lin's CCC>0.89）。

Conclusion: 通过思维链提示和PEFT微调，开源LLM仅基于文本输入就能准确预测24小时饮食回顾中的能量和宏量营养素值，这为低负担的文本饮食监测工具带来了希望。

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Most artificial intelligence tools used to estimate nutritional
content rely on image input. However, whether large language models (LLMs) can
accurately predict nutritional values based solely on text descriptions of
foods consumed remains unknown. If effective, this approach could enable
simpler dietary monitoring without the need for photographs. METHODS: We used
24-hour dietary recalls from adolescents aged 12-19 years in the National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). An open-source quantized LLM
was prompted using a 10-shot, chain-of-thought approach to estimate energy and
five macronutrients based solely on text strings listing foods and their
quantities. We then applied parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) to evaluate
whether predictive accuracy improved. NHANES-calculated values served as the
ground truth for energy, proteins, carbohydrates, total sugar, dietary fiber
and total fat. RESULTS: In a pooled dataset of 11,281 adolescents (49.9% male,
mean age 15.4 years), the vanilla LLM yielded poor predictions. The mean
absolute error (MAE) was 652.08 for energy and the Lin's CCC <0.46 across
endpoints. In contrast, the fine-tuned model performed substantially better,
with energy MAEs ranging from 171.34 to 190.90 across subsets, and Lin's CCC
exceeding 0.89 for all outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: When prompted using a
chain-of-thought approach and fine-tuned with PEFT, open-source LLMs exposed
solely to text input can accurately predict energy and macronutrient values
from 24-hour dietary recalls. This approach holds promise for low-burden,
text-based dietary monitoring tools.

*Ke Sun,Mayi Xu*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: KGTB是一个基于知识图谱的生成式POI推荐方法，通过KG结构保留异构信息，并使用多行为学习任务来微调LLM，解决了传统方法的信息丢失和行为理解不足问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有生成式POI推荐方法存在两个主要问题：1）分词器难以编码推荐数据中的异构信号，导致信息丢失；2）指令微调任务只关注POI访问行为，忽略其他行为类型，对移动性理解不足。

Method: 提出KGTB方法：1）将推荐数据组织为知识图谱格式以保留异构信息；2）开发基于KG的分词器，将每个节点量化为结构ID；3）引入多行为学习任务（POI、类别、区域访问行为）进行LLM微调。

Result: 在四个真实城市数据集上的实验表明，KGTB具有优越的性能表现。

Conclusion: KGTB通过知识图谱结构化和多行为学习，有效解决了生成式POI推荐中的信息丢失和行为理解不足问题，取得了更好的推荐效果。

Abstract: Generative paradigm, especially powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), has
emerged as a new solution to the next point-of-interest (POI) recommendation.
Pioneering studies usually adopt a two-stage pipeline, starting with a
tokenizer converting POIs into discrete identifiers that can be processed by
LLMs, followed by POI behavior prediction tasks to instruction-tune LLM for
next POI recommendation. Despite of remarkable progress, they still face two
limitations: (1) existing tokenizers struggle to encode heterogeneous signals
in the recommendation data, suffering from information loss issue, and (2)
previous instruction-tuning tasks only focus on users' POI visit behavior while
ignore other behavior types, resulting in insufficient understanding of
mobility. To address these limitations, we propose KGTB (Knowledge Graph
Tokenization for Behavior-aware generative next POI recommendation).
Specifically, KGTB organizes the recommendation data in a knowledge graph (KG)
format, of which the structure can seamlessly preserve the heterogeneous
information. Then, a KG-based tokenizer is developed to quantize each node into
an individual structural ID. This process is supervised by the KG's structure,
thus reducing the loss of heterogeneous information. Using generated IDs, KGTB
proposes multi-behavior learning that introduces multiple behavior-specific
prediction tasks for LLM fine-tuning, e.g., POI, category, and region visit
behaviors. Learning on these behavior tasks provides LLMs with comprehensive
insights on the target POI visit behavior. Experiments on four real-world city
datasets demonstrate the superior performance of KGTB.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: LEAF是一个轻量级嵌入对齐框架，通过知识蒸馏将小模型与教师模型对齐，支持信息检索中的非对称架构，无需显式训练即可继承MRL和量化鲁棒性特性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决文本嵌入模型在信息检索中需要高效部署的问题，提出一个轻量级的知识蒸馏框架，使小模型能够与大型教师模型对齐，实现非对称架构的灵活部署。

Method: 使用知识蒸馏框架LEAF，将小模型（leaf模型）与教师模型对齐，支持文档用大模型编码、查询用小模型服务的非对称架构，无需显式训练即可继承教师模型的MRL和量化鲁棒性。

Result: 提出的leaf-ir模型（23M参数）在BEIR基准测试中排名第一，达到同类尺寸模型的新SOTA；在非对称模式下检索性能进一步提升。leaf-mt模型也在MTEB v2（英语）排行榜上排名第一。

Conclusion: LEAF框架有效实现了轻量级嵌入模型与教师模型的对齐，在信息检索和多任务场景中均取得了SOTA性能，且适用于黑盒模型，训练需求低，具有广泛的适用性。

Abstract: We present LEAF ("Lightweight Embedding Alignment Framework"), a knowledge
distillation framework for text embedding models. A key distinguishing feature
is that our distilled leaf models are aligned to their teacher. In the context
of information retrieval, this allows for flexible asymmetric architectures
where documents are encoded with the larger teacher model, while queries can be
served with the smaller leaf models. We also show that leaf models
automatically inherit MRL and robustness to output quantization whenever these
properties are present in the teacher model, without explicitly training for
them. To demonstrate the capability of our framework we publish leaf-ir, a 23M
parameters information retrieval oriented text embedding model trained using
LEAF, which sets a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) on BEIR, ranking #1 on the
public leaderboard for this benchmark and for models of its size. When run in
asymmetric mode, its retrieval performance is further increased. Our scheme is
however not restricted to the information retrieval setting, and we demonstrate
its wider applicability by synthesizing the multi-task leaf-mt model. This also
sets a new SOTA, ranking #1 on the public MTEB v2 (English) leaderboard for its
size. LEAF is applicable to black-box models and in contrast to other embedding
model training frameworks, it does not require judgments nor hard negatives,
and training can be conducted using small batch sizes. Thus, dataset and
training infrastructure requirements for our framework are modest. We make our
models publicly available under a permissive Apache 2.0 license.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 提出了Document Information Gain (DIG)指标来量化检索文档对答案生成的贡献度，并基于此开发了InfoGain-RAG框架，通过训练专门的reranker来筛选最有价值的文档，显著提升了RAG系统的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前RAG框架难以识别检索到的文档是否真正有助于答案生成，无法有效过滤无关或误导性内容，这严重影响了最终性能。

Method: 提出DIG指标计算LLM在有文档和无文档情况下的生成置信度差异来衡量文档价值；开发InfoGain-RAG框架，利用DIG分数训练专门的reranker，从精确区分和准确排序两个角度优先处理检索到的文档。

Result: 在多个模型和基准测试中，InfoGain-RAG显著优于现有方法。在NaturalQA上，相比朴素RAG、自反思RAG和现代基于排序的RAG，分别提升了17.9%、4.5%和12.5%的精确匹配准确率；在GPT-4o上所有数据集平均提升15.3%。

Conclusion: InfoGain-RAG为RAG提供了可靠的解决方案，证明了通过量化文档信息增益来优化文档选择的有效性，适用于多种应用场景。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a promising approach to
address key limitations of Large Language Models (LLMs), such as hallucination,
outdated knowledge, and lacking reference. However, current RAG frameworks
often struggle with identifying whether retrieved documents meaningfully
contribute to answer generation. This shortcoming makes it difficult to filter
out irrelevant or even misleading content, which notably impacts the final
performance. In this paper, we propose Document Information Gain (DIG), a novel
metric designed to quantify the contribution of retrieved documents to correct
answer generation. DIG measures a document's value by computing the difference
of LLM's generation confidence with and without the document augmented.
Further, we introduce InfoGain-RAG, a framework that leverages DIG scores to
train a specialized reranker, which prioritizes each retrieved document from
exact distinguishing and accurate sorting perspectives. This approach can
effectively filter out irrelevant documents and select the most valuable ones
for better answer generation. Extensive experiments across various models and
benchmarks demonstrate that InfoGain-RAG can significantly outperform existing
approaches, on both single and multiple retrievers paradigm. Specifically on
NaturalQA, it achieves the improvements of 17.9%, 4.5%, 12.5% in exact match
accuracy against naive RAG, self-reflective RAG and modern ranking-based RAG
respectively, and even an average of 15.3% increment on advanced proprietary
model GPT-4o across all datasets. These results demonstrate the feasibility of
InfoGain-RAG as it can offer a reliable solution for RAG in multiple
applications.

TL;DR: DiffHash是一种基于扩散模型的深度哈希定向攻击方法，通过LLM生成文本指导优化图像潜在表示，在多空间哈希对齐网络和文本引导注意力机制下生成对抗样本，在迁移性和稳定性方面优于现有方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度哈希模型的定向攻击方法存在多模态指导缺乏、依赖标签信息、基于像素级操作等问题，需要更有效的攻击方法

Method: 使用扩散模型优化图像潜在表示，通过LLM生成目标图像的文本信息作为指导，设计多空间哈希对齐网络将高维图像和文本空间对齐到低维二进制哈希空间，采用文本引导注意力机制重构对抗样本

Result: 在广泛实验中证明该方法优于最先进的定向攻击方法，具有更好的黑盒迁移性和跨数据集的优秀稳定性

Conclusion: DiffHash通过文本引导的潜在空间优化和多空间对齐，有效解决了深度哈希模型的安全漏洞问题，为对抗攻击提供了新思路

Abstract: Deep hashing models have been widely adopted to tackle the challenges of
large-scale image retrieval. However, these approaches face serious security
risks due to their vulnerability to adversarial examples. Despite the
increasing exploration of targeted attacks on deep hashing models, existing
approaches still suffer from a lack of multimodal guidance, reliance on
labeling information and dependence on pixel-level operations for attacks. To
address these limitations, we proposed DiffHash, a novel diffusion-based
targeted attack for deep hashing. Unlike traditional pixel-based attacks that
directly modify specific pixels and lack multimodal guidance, our approach
focuses on optimizing the latent representations of images, guided by text
information generated by a Large Language Model (LLM) for the target image.
Furthermore, we designed a multi-space hash alignment network to align the
high-dimension image space and text space to the low-dimension binary hash
space. During reconstruction, we also incorporated text-guided attention
mechanisms to refine adversarial examples, ensuring them aligned with the
target semantics while maintaining visual plausibility. Extensive experiments
have demonstrated that our method outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) targeted
attack methods, achieving better black-box transferability and offering more
excellent stability across datasets.

Result: 在多个公开数据集上的实验结果表明，FIT模型显著优于现有的最先进预排序基线模型。

Conclusion: FIT模型成功解决了传统双塔模型信息交互不足的问题，在保持高效推理的同时显著提升了预排序效果，为大规模推荐系统提供了更好的解决方案。

Abstract: Pre-ranking plays a crucial role in large-scale recommender systems by
significantly improving the efficiency and scalability within the constraints
of providing high-quality candidate sets in real time. The two-tower model is
widely used in pre-ranking systems due to a good balance between efficiency and
effectiveness with decoupled architecture, which independently processes user
and item inputs before calculating their interaction (e.g. dot product or
similarity measure). However, this independence also leads to the lack of
information interaction between the two towers, resulting in less
effectiveness. In this paper, a novel architecture named learnable Fully
Interacted Two-tower Model (FIT) is proposed, which enables rich information
interactions while ensuring inference efficiency. FIT mainly consists of two
parts: Meta Query Module (MQM) and Lightweight Similarity Scorer (LSS).
Specifically, MQM introduces a learnable item meta matrix to achieve expressive
early interaction between user and item features. Moreover, LSS is designed to
further obtain effective late interaction between the user and item towers.
Finally, experimental results on several public datasets show that our proposed
FIT significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline pre-ranking models.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于人口统计的隐私保护方法，用于生成k-匿名的OD矩阵，不仅保护调查参与者，还保护整个实际人口的推断身份。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统OD矩阵匿名化方法主要关注数据集本身的隐私保护，但缺乏对实际人口统计代表性的考虑。本文旨在开发既能保护调查参与者隐私，又能保护整个推断人口身份的匿名化框架。

Method: 提出了ODkAnon贪婪算法，结合传统方法（ATG、OIGH、Mondrian）进行地理区域泛化，实现k-匿名性。通过统计加权代理代表真实人口段，采用基于人口的隐私视角。

Result: 开发了能够同时为调查参与者和整个实际人口实现k-匿名性的OD矩阵生成方法，平衡了处理速度和质量。

Conclusion: 该方法实现了隐私保护范式的根本转变，从单纯保护数据集转向保护推断的实际人口身份，为包含社会人口统计分段的隐私保护OD矩阵生成提供了新途径。

Abstract: Origin-Destination (OD) matrices are a core component of research on users'
mobility and summarize how individuals move between geographical regions. These
regions should be small enough to be representative of user mobility, without
incurring substantial privacy risks. There are two added values of the
NetMob2025 challenge dataset. Firstly, the data is extensive and contains a lot
of socio-demographic information that can be used to create multiple OD
matrices, based on the segments of the population. Secondly, a participant is
not merely a record in the data, but a statistically weighted proxy for a
segment of the real population. This opens the door to a fundamental shift in
the anonymization paradigm. A population-based view of privacy is central to
our contribution. By adjusting our anonymization framework to account for
representativeness, we are also protecting the inferred identity of the actual
population, rather than survey participants alone. The challenge addressed in
this work is to produce and compare OD matrices that are k-anonymous for survey
participants and for the whole population. We compare several traditional
methods of anonymization to k-anonymity by generalizing geographical areas.
These include generalization over a hierarchy (ATG and OIGH) and the classical
Mondrian. To this established toolkit, we add a novel method, i.e., ODkAnon, a
greedy algorithm aiming at balancing speed and quality. Unlike previous
approaches, which primarily address the privacy aspects of the given datasets,
we aim to contribute to the generation of privacy-preserving OD matrices
enriched with socio-demographic segmentation that achieves k-anonymity on the
actual population.

Conclusion: 推荐系统和机器学习社区迫切需要采用绿色AI原则，在算法进步和环境责任之间取得平衡，构建可持续的AI个性化未来

Abstract: As global warming soars, the need to assess and reduce the environmental
impact of recommender systems is becoming increasingly urgent. Despite this,
the recommender systems community hardly understands, addresses, and evaluates
the environmental impact of their work. In this study, we examine the
environmental impact of recommender systems research by reproducing typical
experimental pipelines. Based on our results, we provide guidelines for
researchers and practitioners on how to minimize the environmental footprint of
their work and implement green recommender systems - recommender systems
designed to minimize their energy consumption and carbon footprint. Our
analysis covers 79 papers from the 2013 and 2023 ACM RecSys conferences,
comparing traditional "good old-fashioned AI" models with modern deep learning
models. We designed and reproduced representative experimental pipelines for
both years, measuring energy consumption using a hardware energy meter and
converting it into CO2 equivalents. Our results show that papers utilizing deep
learning models emit approximately 42 times more CO2 equivalents than papers
using traditional models. On average, a single deep learning-based paper
generates 2,909 kilograms of CO2 equivalents - more than the carbon emissions
of a person flying from New York City to Melbourne or the amount of CO2
sequestered by one tree over 260 years. This work underscores the urgent need
for the recommender systems and wider machine learning communities to adopt
green AI principles, balancing algorithmic advancements and environmental
responsibility to build a sustainable future with AI-powered personalization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决推荐系统中的冷启动问题，特别是在新用户或新物品缺乏历史交互数据时，传统基于内容或混合方法在稀疏元数据环境中只能捕捉浅层模式

Method: 应用Byte Pair Encoding(BPE)分词和预训练大语言模型(LLM)嵌入，获得与BPE词汇表对齐的细粒度词元级向量，作为未见实体的密集语义先验

Result: 在基准数据集上的实验显示，BPE-LLM方法在Recall@k、NDCG@k和Hit Rate指标上优于标准基线，具有更好的泛化性和可解释性，计算性能充足

Conclusion: 词元级语义初始化作为轻量级但有效的扩展，可应用于现代推荐系统的零样本设置，在多语言和稀疏输入环境下表现优异

Abstract: The cold-start issue is the challenge when we talk about recommender systems,
especially in the case when we do not have the past interaction data of new
users or new items. Content-based features or hybrid solutions are common as
conventional solutions, but they can only work in a sparse metadata environment
with shallow patterns. In this paper, the efficient cold-start recommendation
strategy is presented, which is based on the sub word-level representations by
applying Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) tokenization and pre-trained Large Language
Model (LLM) embedding in the initialization procedure. We obtain fine-grained
token-level vectors that are aligned with the BPE vocabulary as opposed to
using coarse-grained sentence embeddings. Together, these token embeddings can
be used as dense semantic priors on unseen entities, making immediate
recommendation performance possible without user-item interaction history. Our
mechanism can be compared to collaborative filtering systems and tested over
benchmark datasets with stringent cold-start assumptions. Experimental findings
show that the given BPE-LLM method achieves higher Recall@k, NDCG@k, and Hit
Rate measurements compared to the standard baseline and displays the same
capability of sufficient computational performance. Furthermore, we demonstrate
that using subword-aware embeddings yields better generalizability and is more
interpretable, especially within a multilingual and sparse input setting. The
practical application of token-level semantic initialization as a lightweight,
but nevertheless effective extension to modern recommender systems in the
zero-shot setting is indicated within this work.

including code generation across diverse open-source domains. However, their
applicability in proprietary industrial settings, where domain-specific
constraints and code interdependencies are prevalent, remains largely
unexplored. We present a case study conducted in collaboration with the
leveling department at ASML to investigate the performance of LLMs in
generating functional, maintainable code within a closed, highly specialized
software environment.
  We developed an evaluation framework tailored to ASML's proprietary codebase
and introduced a new benchmark. Additionally, we proposed a new evaluation
metric, build@k, to assess whether LLM-generated code successfully compiles and
integrates within real industrial repositories. We investigate various
prompting techniques, compare the performance of generic and code-specific
LLMs, and examine the impact of model size on code generation capabilities,
using both match-based and execution-based metrics. The findings reveal that
prompting techniques and model size have a significant impact on output
quality, with few-shot and chain-of-thought prompting yielding the highest
build success rates. The difference in performance between the code-specific
LLMs and generic LLMs was less pronounced and varied substantially across
different model families.

*Sparsh Gupta,Kamalavasan Kamalakkannan,Maxim Moraru,Galen Shipman,Patrick Diehl*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个基于多智能体LLM的工作流，能够自动将遗留的Fortran代码转换为性能可移植的Kokkos C++程序，实现了跨硬件平台的代码现代化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着HPC向GPU加速的异构架构转变，许多加速器缺乏原生Fortran绑定，需要将遗留的Fortran代码现代化以实现性能可移植性。手动移植工作量大且需要专业知识。

Method: 使用专门的LLM智能体协作工作流，包括翻译、验证、编译、运行、测试、调试和优化等步骤，将Fortran内核转换为可移植的Kokkos C++程序。

Result: 工作流成功现代化了多个基准内核，生成的Kokkos代码在不同硬件分区上实现了性能可移植性。付费OpenAI模型仅需几美元就能生成优化的代码，性能超过Fortran基线，而开源模型往往无法生成功能代码。

Conclusion: 这项工作证明了基于智能体AI的Fortran-to-Kokkos转换的可行性，为自主现代化遗留科学应用程序提供了途径，使其能够在不同的超级计算机上可移植且高效地运行。

Abstract: Scientific applications continue to rely on legacy Fortran codebases
originally developed for homogeneous, CPU-based systems. As High-Performance
Computing (HPC) shifts toward heterogeneous GPU-accelerated architectures, many
accelerators lack native Fortran bindings, creating an urgent need to modernize
legacy codes for portability. Frameworks like Kokkos provide performance
portability and a single-source C++ abstraction, but manual Fortran-to-Kokkos
porting demands significant expertise and time. Large language models (LLMs)
have shown promise in source-to-source code generation, yet their use in fully
autonomous workflows for translating and optimizing parallel code remains
largely unexplored, especially for performance portability across diverse
hardware.
  This paper presents an agentic AI workflow where specialized LLM "agents"
collaborate to translate, validate, compile, run, test, debug, and optimize
Fortran kernels into portable Kokkos C++ programs. Results show the pipeline
modernizes a range of benchmark kernels, producing performance-portable Kokkos
codes across hardware partitions. Paid OpenAI models such as GPT-5 and
o4-mini-high executed the workflow for only a few U.S. dollars, generating
optimized codes that surpassed Fortran baselines, whereas open-source models
like Llama4-Maverick often failed to yield functional codes.
  This work demonstrates the feasibility of agentic AI for Fortran-to-Kokkos
transformation and offers a pathway for autonomously modernizing legacy
scientific applications to run portably and efficiently on diverse
supercomputers. It further highlights the potential of LLM-driven agentic
systems to perform structured, domain-specific reasoning tasks in scientific
and systems-oriented applications.

*Satwik Ghanta,Peggy Gregory,Gul Calikli*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 该研究通过案例研究发现金融服务公司中高层管理者与开发人员在可持续软件工程认知上存在明显差异：管理层关注技术和经济可持续性，而开发者更关注工作负荷和压力等人本因素。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 可持续软件工程(SSE)缺乏针对特定组织背景（如受严格监管、数据驱动的金融服务行业）的理解，需要研究不同组织层级对可持续性的认知差异。

Method: 采用探索性定性案例研究，通过对金融服务公司6名高管和16名软件工程师进行访谈和焦点小组讨论，涵盖从初级开发人员到团队负责人的不同经验层级。

Result: 发现组织层级间对可持续性的认知存在明显分歧：高管强调技术经济可持续性（云迁移、业务连续性），开发者关注人本因素（工作负荷管理、压力减少），且开发者对组织倡议持怀疑态度。

Conclusion: 组织目标与开发者需求之间的脱节凸显了需要情境敏感、共同设计的干预措施的重要性，许多参与者倾向于建立专门的可持续性团队，类似于安全治理的内部结构。

Abstract: Sustainable Software Engineering (SSE) is slowly becoming an industry need
for reasons including reputation enhancement, improved profits and more
efficient practices. However, SSE has many definitions, and this is a challenge
for organisations trying to build a common and broadly agreed understanding of
the term. Although much research effort has gone into identifying general SSE
practices, there is a gap in understanding the sustainability needs of specific
organisational contexts, such as financial services, which are highly
data-driven, operate under strict regulatory requirements, and handle millions
of transactions day to day. To address this gap, our research focuses on a
financial services company (FinServCo) that invited us to investigate
perceptions of sustainability in their IT function: how it could be put into
practice, who is responsible for it, and what the challenges are. We conducted
an exploratory qualitative case study using interviews and a focus group with
six higher management employees and 16 software engineers comprising various
experience levels from junior developers to team leaders. Our study found a
clear divergence in how sustainability is perceived between organisational
levels. Higher management emphasised technical and economic sustainability,
focusing on cloud migration and business continuity through data availability.
In contrast, developers highlighted human-centric concerns such as workload
management and stress reduction. Scepticism toward organisational initiatives
was also evident, with some developers viewing them as a PR strategy. Many
participants expressed a preference for a dedicated sustainability team,
drawing analogies to internal structures for security governance. The
disconnect between organisational goals and individual developer needs
highlights the importance of context-sensitive, co-designed interventions.

TL;DR: 本文首次对vibe coding进行了系统的定性研究，通过访谈和社交媒体数据分析，揭示了这种AI辅助编程范式的本质、实践方式、痛点风险以及最佳实践。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: vibe coding作为一种新兴的AI辅助编程范式，虽然已有初步研究，但缺乏对开发者实际体验和感知的实证理解，需要系统性的定性研究来建立理论基础。

Method: 采用定性研究方法，分析超过19万字的半结构化访谈、Reddit讨论和LinkedIn帖子数据，构建基于实证的vibe coding理论框架。

Result: 提出了以对话式AI交互、共同创造和开发者心流体验为核心的vibe coding理论；发现AI信任在委托到共同创造的连续体中起调节作用；识别了规范、可靠性、调试等痛点和风险；总结了缓解挑战的最佳实践。

Conclusion: 研究为AI开发工具的未来发展提供了重要启示，并为vibe coding的进一步研究指明了方向，强调了开发者体验和AI信任在编程范式演进中的关键作用。

Abstract: Vibe coding, a term coined by Andrej Karpathy in February 2025, has quickly
become a compelling and controversial natural language programming paradigm in
AI-assisted software development. Centered on iterative co-design with an AI
assistant, vibe coding emphasizes flow and experimentation over strict upfront
specification. While initial studies have begun to explore this paradigm, most
focus on analyzing code artifacts or proposing theories with limited empirical
backing. There remains a need for a grounded understanding of vibe coding as it
is perceived and experienced by developers. We present the first systematic
qualitative investigation of vibe coding perceptions and practice. Drawing on
over 190,000 words from semi-structured interviews, Reddit threads, and
LinkedIn posts, we characterize what vibe coding is, why and how developers use
it, where it breaks down, and which emerging practices aim to support it. We
propose a qualitatively grounded theory of vibe coding centered on
conversational interaction with AI, co-creation, and developer flow and joy. We
find that AI trust regulates movement along a continuum from delegation to
co-creation and supports the developer experience by sustaining flow. We
surface recurring pain points and risks in areas including specification,
reliability, debugging, latency, code review burden, and collaboration. We also
present best practices that have been discovered and shared to mitigate these
challenges. We conclude with implications for the future of AI dev tools and
directions for researchers investigating vibe coding.

TL;DR: 本研究探索集成学习如何提升大语言模型在源代码漏洞检测中的性能，通过多种集成策略和提出的动态门控堆叠方法，显著提高了检测效果，特别是在处理不平衡数据集和多分类任务时。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型在代码漏洞检测中存在结果不一致性问题，这种不一致性虽然影响检测稳定性，但也揭示了模型间的潜在互补性，可以通过集成学习来构建更鲁棒的检测系统。

Method: 使用5个大语言模型（DeepSeek-Coder-6.7B、CodeLlama-7B、CodeLlama-13B、CodeQwen1.5-7B、StarCoder2-15B）和3种集成策略（Bagging、Boosting、Stacking），在3个数据集（Devign、ReVeal、BigVul）上进行实验，并提出基于混合专家技术的动态门控堆叠（DGS）方法。

Result: 集成方法显著提升了检测性能，Boosting在不平衡数据集场景中表现优异，DGS在传统Stacking基础上进一步改进，特别是在处理类别不平衡和多分类任务时效果更好。

Conclusion: 集成学习能够有效提升基于大语言模型的漏洞检测系统的可靠性和有效性，为构建更稳健的检测系统提供了有价值的见解。

Abstract: Code vulnerability detection is crucial for ensuring the security and
reliability of modern software systems. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs)
have shown promising capabilities in this domain. However, notable
discrepancies in detection results often arise when analyzing identical code
segments across different training stages of the same model or among
architecturally distinct LLMs. While such inconsistencies may compromise
detection stability, they also highlight a key opportunity: the latent
complementarity among models can be harnessed through ensemble learning to
create more robust vulnerability detection systems. In this study, we explore
the potential of ensemble learning to enhance the performance of LLMs in source
code vulnerability detection. We conduct comprehensive experiments involving
five LLMs (i.e., DeepSeek-Coder-6.7B, CodeLlama-7B, CodeLlama-13B,
CodeQwen1.5-7B, and StarCoder2-15B), using three ensemble strategies (i.e.,
Bagging, Boosting, and Stacking). These experiments are carried out across
three widely adopted datasets (i.e., Devign, ReVeal, and BigVul). Inspired by
Mixture of Experts (MoE) techniques, we further propose Dynamic Gated Stacking
(DGS), a Stacking variant tailored for vulnerability detection. Our results
demonstrate that ensemble approaches can significantly improve detection
performance, with Boosting excelling in scenarios involving imbalanced
datasets. Moreover, DGS consistently outperforms traditional Stacking,
particularly in handling class imbalance and multi-class classification tasks.
These findings offer valuable insights into building more reliable and
effective LLM-based vulnerability detection systems through ensemble learning.

Motivation: UAV与LLM整合虽受关注，但现有研究多为初步探索，缺乏对实际应用的深入理解，存在学术研究与实际需求脱节的风险。

Method: 研究分析了74篇论文和56个GitHub项目，识别了LLM在UAV系统中的9种任务类型，并通过在线问卷收集了52份有效反馈。

Result: 学术研究侧重理论建模和任务优化，而工业项目更关注飞行控制、任务规划和人机交互；40.4%的从业者尝试过将LLM应用于UAV任务。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了UAV与LLM整合的技术成熟度、性能、安全性和成本等障碍，并为未来发展提出了挑战和建议。

Abstract: The integration of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and large language models
(LLMs) has emerged as a research direction of growing interest, with the
potential to address challenges in autonomous decision-making, human-UAV
interaction, and real-time adaptability. However, existing studies have
remained largely in preliminary exploration with a limited understanding of
real-world practice, risking a misalignment between academic research and
practical needs and hindering the translation of results. To examine and
address these potential challenges, we conducted an empirical study of 74
selected papers and 56 public GitHub projects, identified nine task types for
LLMs in UAV systems, and quantified their distribution. Our findings show that
academic research emphasizes theoretical modeling and task optimization with
dispersed attention across tasks. In contrast, industrial projects focus on
flight control, task planning, and human-machine interaction, prioritizing
operability and efficiency. To further capture industry perspectives, we
distributed an online questionnaire. We obtained 52 valid responses: 40.4% of
practitioners have attempted to apply LLMs to UAV tasks. We further identify
factors that impede real-world integration, including technological maturity,
performance, safety, cost, and other considerations. Finally, we highlight
challenges for future development and provide recommendations.

Conclusion: 大型语言模型为汽车系统的长期维护、更新和扩展提供了有前景的自动化解决方案，能够显著提高系统灵活性

Abstract: There are many bottlenecks that decrease the flexibility of automotive
systems, making their long-term maintenance, as well as updates and extensions
in later lifecycle phases increasingly difficult, mainly due to long

heterogeneity and numerosity of devices and underlying software components
involved. In this paper, we explore the potential of Large Language Models
(LLMs) when it comes to the automation of tasks and processes that aim to
increase the flexibility of automotive systems. Three case studies towards
achieving this goal are considered as outcomes of early-stage research: 1)
updates, hardware abstraction, and compliance, 2) interface compatibility
checking, and 3) architecture modification suggestions. For proof-of-concept
implementation, we rely on OpenAI's GPT-4o model.

TL;DR: SateLight是一个专为卫星计算设计的应用更新框架，通过容器化、差分传输和容错机制，显著减少传输延迟并确保更新可靠性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 卫星计算需要应用软件更新，但现有地面系统方法无法应对卫星环境的异构性、带宽限制和恶劣空间条件

Method: 采用容器化封装异构应用，集成内容感知差分策略减少通信量，细粒度星上更新设计重构目标应用，以及基于分层的容错恢复机制

Result: 在卫星模拟环境中，相比最佳基线传输延迟降低91.18%（平均56.54%），所有评估应用实现100%更新正确性，真实在轨卫星案例验证了实用性

Conclusion: SateLight为卫星计算提供了一种实用有效的应用更新解决方案，解决了卫星环境下的特殊约束问题

Abstract: Satellite computing is an emerging paradigm that empowers satellites to
perform onboard processing tasks (i.e., \textit{satellite applications}),
thereby reducing reliance on ground-based systems and improving responsiveness.
However, enabling application software updates in this context remains a
fundamental challenge due to application heterogeneity, limited
ground-to-satellite bandwidth, and harsh space conditions. Existing software
update approaches, designed primarily for terrestrial systems, fail to address
these constraints, as they assume abundant computational capacity and stable
connectivity.
  To address this gap, we propose SateLight, a practical and effective
satellite application update framework tailored for satellite computing.
SateLight leverages containerization to encapsulate heterogeneous applications,
enabling efficient deployment and maintenance. SateLight further integrates
three capabilities: (1) a content-aware differential strategy that minimizes
communication data volume, (2) a fine-grained onboard update design that
reconstructs target applications, and (3) a layer-based fault-tolerant recovery
mechanism to ensure reliability under failure-prone space conditions.
Experimental results on a satellite simulation environment with 10
representative satellite applications demonstrate that SateLight reduces
transmission latency by up to 91.18% (average 56.54%) compared to the best
currently available baseline. It also consistently ensures 100% update
correctness across all evaluated applications. Furthermore, a case study on a
real-world in-orbit satellite demonstrates the practicality of our approach.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然LLM在自动化源代码翻译方面显示出潜力，但关于模型选择、提示设计和提示语言如何影响跨多种编程语言的翻译质量，仍缺乏系统的比较证据。

Method: 使用BLEU和CodeBLEU指标，在两种提示风格（简洁指令和详细规范）和两种提示语言（英语和阿拉伯语）下，对最先进的LLM进行代码翻译的实证评估，涵盖C++、Java、Python和C#之间的双向翻译。

Result: 详细提示在所有模型和翻译方向上带来一致提升，英语提示比阿拉伯语提示性能高13-15%。最佳模型在Java到C#和Python到C++等挑战性语言对上获得最高CodeBLEU分数，所有LLM均超越TransCoder基准。

Conclusion: 研究证明了精心设计的提示工程和提示语言选择的重要性，为软件现代化和跨语言互操作性提供了实用指导。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise for automated source-code
translation, a capability critical to software migration, maintenance, and
interoperability. Yet comparative evidence on how model choice, prompt design,
and prompt language shape translation quality across multiple programming
languages remains limited. This study conducts a systematic empirical
assessment of state-of-the-art LLMs for code translation among C++, Java,
Python, and C#, alongside a traditional baseline (TransCoder). Using BLEU and
CodeBLEU, we quantify syntactic fidelity and structural correctness under two
prompt styles (concise instruction and detailed specification) and two prompt
languages (English and Arabic), with direction-aware evaluation across language
pairs. Experiments show that detailed prompts deliver consistent gains across
models and translation directions, and English prompts outperform Arabic by
13-15%. The top-performing model attains the highest CodeBLEU on challenging
pairs such as Java to C# and Python to C++. Our evaluation shows that each LLM
outperforms TransCoder across the benchmark. These results demonstrate the
value of careful prompt engineering and prompt language choice, and provide
practical guidance for software modernization and cross-language
interoperability.

Abstract: The high rate of false alarms from static analysis tools and Large Language
Models (LLMs) complicates vulnerability detection in Solidity Smart Contracts,
demanding methods that can formally or empirically prove the presence of
defects. This paper introduces a novel detection pipeline that integrates
custom Slither-based detectors, LLMs, Kontrol, and Forge. Our approach is
designed to reliably detect defects and generate proofs. We currently perform
experiments with promising results for seven types of critical defects. We
demonstrate the pipeline's efficacy by presenting our findings for three
vulnerabilities -- Reentrancy, Complex Fallback, and Faulty Access Control
Policies -- that are challenging for current verification solutions, which
often generate false alarms or fail to detect them entirely. We highlight the
potential of either symbolic or concrete execution in correctly classifying
such code faults. By chaining these instruments, our method effectively
validates true positives, significantly reducing the manual verification
burden. Although we identify potential limitations, such as the inconsistency
and the cost of LLMs, our findings establish a robust framework for combining
heuristic analysis with formal verification to achieve more reliable and
automated smart contract auditing.

TL;DR: 提出了渐进式知识增强(PKE)框架，通过多阶段提示逐步激活LLM的潜在知识，显著提升了半导体设备语言ALPG的代码生成准确率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 半导体制造设备语言(如ALPG)编程难度高、学习曲线陡峭，现有LLM在生成这类低级设备语言代码方面效果有限，需要新的方法来提升LLM在专业领域的代码生成能力

Method: 渐进式知识增强(PKE)框架，采用多阶段提示策略，从简单到复杂的示例逐步提取和激活LLM的潜在知识，无需大量微调

Result: 在工业ALPG数据集上，PKE显著优于标准提示方法，比次优技术分别高出11.1%和15.2%的精确匹配分数，证明了基于难度渐进式知识提取的有效性

Conclusion: PKE为提升LLM在专业低级编程领域的能力提供了实用方法，有助于提高半导体软件开发的生产力

Abstract: Semiconductors form the backbone of modern electronics, with their
manufacturing and testing relying on highly specialized equipment and
domain-specific programming languages. Equipment languages such as the
Algorithmic Pattern Generator (ALPG) are critical for precise hardware control
but are challenging to program due to their low-level syntax and steep learning
curve. While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in generating
high-level code from natural language, their effectiveness on low-level
equipment languages remains limited. To address this, we propose Progressive
Knowledge Enhancement (PKE), a novel multi-stage prompting framework that
progressively extracts and activates the latent knowledge within LLMs, guiding
them from simple to complex examples without extensive fine-tuning. Empirical
evaluation on an industrial ALPG dataset shows that PKE significantly
outperforms standard prompting and surpasses state-of-the-art methods in
generating correct ALPG code, achieving 11.1\% and 15.2\% higher exact match
scores compared to the second-best technique. Further analysis of individual
components confirms that progressive knowledge extraction based on difficulty
enhances accuracy. Our study offer a practical approach to boosting LLM
capabilities for specialized low-level programming, supporting greater
productivity in semiconductor software development.

Abstract: Background: Conducting Multi Vocal Literature Reviews (MVLRs) is often time
and effort-intensive. Researchers must review and filter a large number of
unstructured sources, which frequently contain sparse information and are
unlikely to be included in the final study. Our experience conducting an MVLR
on Context-Aware Software Systems (CASS) Testing in the avionics domain
exemplified this challenge, with over 8,000 highly heterogeneous documents
requiring review. Therefore, we developed a Large Language Model (LLM)
assistant to support the search and filtering of documents. Aims: To develop
and validate an LLM based tool that can support researchers in performing the
search and filtering of documents for an MVLR without compromising the rigor of
the research protocol. Method: We applied sound engineering practices to
develop an on-premises LLM-based tool incorporating Retrieval Augmented
Generation (RAG) to process candidate sources. Progress towards the aim was
quantified using the Positive Percent Agreement (PPA) as the primary metric to
ensure the performance of the LLM based tool. Convenience sampling, supported
by human judgment and statistical sampling, were used to verify and validate
the tool's quality-in-use. Results: The tool currently demonstrates a PPA
agreement with human researchers of 90% for sources that are not relevant to
the study. Development details are shared to support domain-specific adaptation
of the tool. Conclusions: Using LLM-based tools to support academic researchers
in rigorous MVLR is feasible. These tools can free valuable time for
higher-level, abstract tasks. However, researcher participation remains
essential to ensure that the tool supports thorough research.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 对红帽产品1999-2024年漏洞修复的时间序列分析显示，漏洞产品和组件数量不稳定，呈线性增长趋势，但与整体漏洞趋势不一致，且有断点表明安全债务增长可能趋于稳定。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受软件维护和安全债务概念的启发，研究红帽产品漏洞修复的时间趋势。

Method: 采用分段回归分析方法对红帽产品1999-2024年的漏洞修复数据进行时间序列分析。

Result: 漏洞产品和组件数量不稳定，呈线性增长趋势，与整体漏洞趋势不一致，存在明显断点。

Conclusion: 安全债务增长可能正在稳定，线性趋势并非普遍适用，需要持续监控漏洞修复模式。

Abstract: Motivated by software maintenance and the more recent concept of security
debt, the paper presents a time series analysis of vulnerability patching of
Red Hat's products and components between 1999 and 2024. According to the
results based on segmented regression analysis, the amounts of vulnerable
products and components have not been stable; a linear trend describes many of
the series well. Nor do the amounts align well with trends characterizing
vulnerabilities in general. There are also visible breakpoints indicating that
the linear trend is not universally applicable and that the growing security
debt may be stabilizing.

*Talaya Farasat,Joachim Posegga*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 本研究评估了Word2Vec、CodeBERT和GraphCodeBERT三种代码嵌入技术与BiLSTM和CNN两种深度学习分类器在Python漏洞检测中的组合效果，发现Word2Vec+BiLSTM组合表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着源代码复杂度和规模的增加，手动漏洞检测变得不切实际，需要研究自动化的机器学习方法来进行有效的漏洞检测。

Method: 使用三种代码嵌入技术（Word2Vec、CodeBERT、GraphCodeBERT）和两种深度学习分类器（BiLSTM、CNN）进行组合实验，评估在Python源代码漏洞检测中的性能。

Result: CNN与GraphCodeBERT组合表现良好，但Word2Vec与BiLSTM组合始终获得最佳整体性能，表明经典嵌入技术在序列模型中的优势。

Conclusion: 选择合适的嵌入技术和分类器组合对提升自动化漏洞检测系统效果至关重要，传统方法在某些场景下仍具有竞争优势。

Abstract: In recent years, the growing complexity and scale of source code have
rendered manual software vulnerability detection increasingly impractical. To
address this challenge, automated approaches leveraging machine learning and
code embeddings have gained substantial attention. This study investigates the
optimal combination of code embedding techniques and machine learning
classifiers for vulnerability detection in Python source code. We evaluate
three embedding techniques, i.e., Word2Vec, CodeBERT, and GraphCodeBERT
alongside two deep learning classifiers, i.e., Bidirectional Long Short-Term
Memory (BiLSTM) networks and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). While CNN
paired with GraphCodeBERT exhibits strong performance, the BiLSTM model using
Word2Vec consistently achieves superior overall results. These findings suggest
that, despite the advanced architectures of recent models like CodeBERT and
GraphCodeBERT, classical embeddings such as Word2Vec, when used with
sequence-based models like BiLSTM, can offer a slight yet consistent
performance advantage. The study underscores the critical importance of
selecting appropriate combinations of embeddings and classifiers to enhance the
effectiveness of automated vulnerability detection systems, particularly for
Python source code.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 本研究通过灰色文献综述首次提出了AI原生应用的双层工程蓝图，明确了其核心特征、关键质量属性和典型技术栈，为AI原生应用的系统设计、质量保证和技术选型提供了系统指导。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI原生应用作为软件工程新范式缺乏统一的工程定义和架构蓝图，从业者缺乏系统设计、质量保证和技术选型的系统指导，需要建立对其的全面理解。

Method: 采用灰色文献综述方法，结合Google和Bing搜索获取的概念视角与GitHub领先开源项目的实践洞察，应用包含来源选择、质量评估和主题分析的结构化协议来综合异构来源的发现。

Result: 基于选择标准确定了106项研究，分析显示AI原生应用以AI作为系统智能范式的核心作用和固有的概率性、非确定性本质为两大核心支柱，关键质量属性包括可靠性、可用性、性能效率和AI特定的可观测性，典型技术栈包括LLM编排框架、向量数据库和AI原生可观测平台。

Conclusion: 本研究首次提出了AI原生应用的双层工程蓝图，为这一新兴领域的工程实践提供了系统化的理论框架和实践指导。

Abstract: Background: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has given
rise to AI-native applications, a new paradigm in software engineering that
fundamentally redefines how software is designed, developed, and evolved.
Despite their growing prominence, AI-native applications still lack a unified
engineering definition and architectural blueprint, leaving practitioners
without systematic guidance for system design, quality assurance, and
technology selection.
  Objective: This study seeks to establish a comprehensive understanding of
AI-native applications by identifying their defining characteristics, key
quality attributes, and typical technology stacks, as well as by clarifying the
opportunities and challenges they present.
  Method: We conducted a grey literature review, integrating conceptual
perspectives retrieved from targeted Google and Bing searches with practical
insights derived from leading open-source projects on GitHub. A structured
protocol encompassing source selection, quality assessment, and thematic
analysis was applied to synthesize findings across heterogeneous sources.
  Results: We finally identified 106 studies based on the selection criteria.
The analysis reveals that AI-native applications are distinguished by two core
pillars: the central role of AI as the system's intelligence paradigm and their
inherently probabilistic, non-deterministic nature. Critical quality attributes
include reliability, usability, performance efficiency, and AI-specific
observability. In addition, a typical technology stack has begun to emerge,
comprising LLM orchestration frameworks, vector databases, and AI-native
observability platforms. These systems emphasize response quality,
cost-effectiveness, and outcome predictability, setting them apart from
conventional software systems.
  Conclusion: This study is the first to propose a dual-layered engineering
blueprint...

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: 提出软硬件协同设计方法，结合自适应归一化流模型和电阻存储器神经微分方程求解器，显著提升晶格场论模拟的效率和能耗表现


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统晶格场论模拟面临计算成本高、并行性有限、传统归一化流模型训练开销大以及数字硬件能效低等挑战

Method: 软件方面采用自适应归一化流(ANF)模型实现高效并行配置生成，结合低秩适应(LoRA)进行低成本微调；硬件方面使用电阻存储器内存计算提升并行性和能效

Result: 在标量phi4理论和石墨烯线有效场论中验证，相比HMC方法自相关时间减少8.2倍和13.9倍，LoRA微调权重少于8%；相比GPU实现16.1-17.0倍加速和73.7-138.0倍能效提升

Conclusion: 软硬件协同设计为高维晶格场论模拟提供了高效、低成本的解决方案，显著提升了计算性能和能源效率

Abstract: Lattice field theory (LFT) simulations underpin advances in classical
statistical mechanics and quantum field theory, providing a unified
computational framework across particle, nuclear, and condensed matter physics.
However, the application of these methods to high-dimensional systems remains
severely constrained by several challenges, including the prohibitive
computational cost and limited parallelizability of conventional sampling
algorithms such as hybrid Monte Carlo (HMC), the substantial training expense
associated with traditional normalizing flow models, and the inherent energy
inefficiency of digital hardware architectures. Here, we introduce a
software-hardware co-design that integrates an adaptive normalizing flow (ANF)
model with a resistive memory-based neural differential equation solver,
enabling efficient generation of LFT configurations. Software-wise, ANF enables
efficient parallel generation of statistically independent configurations,
thereby reducing computational costs, while low-rank adaptation (LoRA) allows
cost-effective fine-tuning across diverse simulation parameters. Hardware-wise,
in-memory computing with resistive memory substantially enhances both
parallelism and energy efficiency. We validate our approach on the scalar phi4
theory and the effective field theory of graphene wires, using a hybrid
analog-digital neural differential equation solver equipped with a 180 nm
resistive memory in-memory computing macro. Our co-design enables low-cost
computation, achieving approximately 8.2-fold and 13.9-fold reductions in
integrated autocorrelation time over HMC, while requiring fine-tuning of less
than 8% of the weights via LoRA. Compared to state-of-the-art GPUs, our
co-design achieves up to approximately 16.1- and 17.0-fold speedups for the two
tasks, as well as 73.7- and 138.0-fold improvements in energy efficiency.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索人类如何快速理解有意义句子的机制，研究在熟悉情境中学习新序列的认知过程

Method: 将Small World of Words词联想规范数据集嵌入基于层次时序记忆模型的脉冲神经网络中，模拟长期记忆

Result: 有意义句子学习速度明显快于随机噪声，短诗学习比随机词序列快得多，且系统对噪声有更大容忍度

Conclusion: 词联想知识能够显著加速有意义语言序列的学习，并提高神经网络对噪声的鲁棒性

Abstract: Learning meaningful sentences is different from learning a random set of
words. When humans understand the meaning, the learning occurs relatively
quickly. What mechanisms enable this to happen? In this paper, we examine the
learning of novel sequences in familiar situations. We embed the Small World of
Words (SWOW-EN), a Word Association Norms (WAN) dataset, in a spiking neural
network based on the Hierarchical Temporal Memory (HTM) model to simulate
long-term memory. Results show that in the presence of SWOW-EN, there is a
clear difference in speed between the learning of meaningful sentences and
random noise. For example, short poems are learned much faster than sequences
of random words. In addition, the system initialized with SWOW-EN weights shows
greater tolerance to noise.

Abstract: Meta-black-box optimization has been significantly advanced through the use
of large language models (LLMs), yet in fancy on constrained evolutionary
optimization. In this work, AwesomeDE is proposed that leverages LLMs as the
strategy of meta-optimizer to generate update rules for constrained
evolutionary algorithm without human intervention. On the meanwhile, $RTO^2H$
framework is introduced for standardize prompt design of LLMs. The
meta-optimizer is trained on a diverse set of constrained optimization
problems. Key components, including prompt design and iterative refinement, are
systematically analyzed to determine their impact on design quality.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms
existing methods in terms of computational efficiency and solution accuracy.
Furthermore, AwesomeDE is shown to generalize well across distinct problem
domains, suggesting its potential for broad applicability. This research
contributes to the field by providing a scalable and data-driven methodology
for automated constrained algorithm design, while also highlighting limitations
and directions for future work.
