### [1] [A comparative study of some wavelet and sampling operators on various features of an image](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14043)
*Digvijay Singh,Rahul Shukla,Karunesh Kumar Singh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究分析了多种正采样Kantorovich算子（SK算子）的收敛性质，包括SK、高斯、双边和阈值小波算子，通过误差测量和数学参数分析验证了基本逼近定理，并展示了不同算子在图像处理中的适用性差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究多种采样Kantorovich算子的收敛特性和逼近性能，为图像处理中的算子选择提供理论依据和性能评估。

Method: 使用SK、高斯、双边和阈值小波算子，通过误差测量（MSE）、斑点指数（SI）、斑点抑制指数（SSI）、斑点均值保持指数（SMPI）和等效视数（ENL）等参数在不同分辨率水平下进行分析，并通过数值示例验证基本逼近定理。

Result: 不同算子在图像处理中表现出不同的性能特征，某些算子对特定图像特征处理效果良好，而其他算子则表现不佳，验证了基本逼近定理的正确性。

Conclusion: 各种算子因其特性不同，在图像处理中各有优势，需要根据具体图像特征选择合适的算子，基本逼近定理为算子性能评估提供了有效框架。

Abstract: This research includes the study of some positive sampling Kantorovich
operators (SK operators) and their convergence properties. A comprehensive
analysis of both local and global approximation properties is presented using
sampling Kantorovich (SK), Gaussian, Bilateral and the thresholding
wavelet-based operators in the framework of SK-operators. Explicitly, we start
the article by introducing the basic terminology and state the fundamental
theorem of approximation (FTA) by imposing the various required conditions
corresponding to the various defined operators. We measure the error and study
the other mathematical parameters such as the mean square error (MSE), the
speckle index (SI), the speckle suppression index (SSI), the speckle mean
preservation index (SMPI), and the equivalent number of looks (ENL) at various
levels of resolution parameters. The nature of these operators are demonstrated
via an example under ideal conditions in tabulated form at a certain level of
samples. Eventually, another numerical example is illustrated to discuss the
region of interest (ROI) via SI, SSI and SMPI of 2D Shepp-Logan Phantom taken
slice from the 3D image, which gives the justification of the fundamental
theorem of approximation (FTA). At the end of the derivation and illustrations
we observe that the various operators have their own significance while
studying the various features of the image because of the uneven nature of an
image (non-ideal condition). Therefore, to some extent, some operators work
well and some do not for some specific features of the image.

### [2] [Federated Action Recognition for Smart Worker Assistance Using FastPose](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14113)
*Vinit Hegiste,Vidit Goyal,Tatjana Legler,Martin Ruskowski*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出基于联邦学习的骨架动作识别框架，在工业场景中实现隐私保护的同时显著提升跨用户泛化能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决工业环境中基于骨架的动作识别在隐私敏感场景下的应用限制，传统集中式方法不适用于实际工业部署

Method: 使用自定义工业手势数据集，采用改进的FastPose模型，比较LSTM和Transformer两种时序骨干网络，在四种训练范式（集中式、本地、FedAvg、FedEnsemble）下进行实验

Result: 联邦学习Transformer比集中式训练提升12.4个百分点，FedEnsemble提升16.3个百分点；在未见客户端上分别提升52.6和58.3个百分点

Conclusion: 联邦学习不仅能保护隐私，还能显著增强跨用户泛化性能，是异构工业环境中可扩展、隐私感知动作识别的实用解决方案

Abstract: In smart manufacturing environments, accurate and real-time recognition of
worker actions is essential for productivity, safety, and human-machine
collaboration. While skeleton-based human activity recognition (HAR) offers
robustness to lighting, viewpoint, and background variations, most existing
approaches rely on centralized datasets, which are impractical in
privacy-sensitive industrial scenarios. This paper presents a federated
learning (FL) framework for pose-based HAR using a custom skeletal dataset of
eight industrially relevant upper-body gestures, captured from five
participants and processed using a modified FastPose model. Two temporal
backbones, an LSTM and a Transformer encoder, are trained and evaluated under
four paradigms: centralized, local (per-client), FL with weighted federated
averaging (FedAvg), and federated ensemble learning (FedEnsemble). On the
global test set, the FL Transformer improves over centralized training by +12.4
percentage points, with FedEnsemble delivering a +16.3 percentage points gain.
On an unseen external client, FL and FedEnsemble exceed centralized accuracy by
+52.6 and +58.3 percentage points, respectively. These results demonstrate that
FL not only preserves privacy but also substantially enhances cross-user
generalization, establishing it as a practical solution for scalable,
privacy-aware HAR in heterogeneous industrial settings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LENS是一个基于强化学习的端到端框架，通过联合优化推理过程和分割任务，在文本提示图像分割中实现了81.2%的平均cIoU，比现有方法提升5.6%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有监督微调方法在测试时忽略了显式的思维链推理，限制了模型对未见提示和领域的泛化能力。

Method: 提出统一的强化学习奖励机制，涵盖句子级、边界框级和分割级线索，鼓励模型生成信息丰富的思维链推理并提升掩码质量。

Result: 在RefCOCO、RefCOCO+和RefCOCOg基准测试中达到81.2%的平均cIoU，比GLaMM方法提升5.6%。

Conclusion: 强化学习驱动的思维链推理为文本提示分割提供了强大的先验，是实现更通用分割模型的有效途径。

Abstract: Text-prompted image segmentation enables fine-grained visual understanding
and is critical for applications such as human-computer interaction and
robotics. However, existing supervised fine-tuning methods typically ignore
explicit chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning at test time, which limits their
ability to generalize to unseen prompts and domains. To address this issue, we
introduce LENS, a scalable reinforcement-learning framework that jointly
optimizes the reasoning process and segmentation in an end-to-end manner. We
propose unified reinforcement-learning rewards that span sentence-, box-, and
segment-level cues, encouraging the model to generate informative CoT
rationales while refining mask quality. Using a publicly available
3-billion-parameter vision-language model, i.e., Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct, LENS
achieves an average cIoU of 81.2% on the RefCOCO, RefCOCO+, and RefCOCOg
benchmarks, outperforming the strong fine-tuned method, i.e., GLaMM, by up to
5.6%. These results demonstrate that RL-driven CoT reasoning serves as a robust
prior for text-prompted segmentation and offers a practical path toward more
generalizable Segment Anything models. Code is available at

Abstract: We introduce RynnEC, a video multimodal large language model designed for
embodied cognition. Built upon a general-purpose vision-language foundation
model, RynnEC incorporates a region encoder and a mask decoder, enabling
flexible region-level video interaction. Despite its compact architecture,
RynnEC achieves state-of-the-art performance in object property understanding,
object segmentation, and spatial reasoning. Conceptually, it offers a
region-centric video paradigm for the brain of embodied agents, providing
fine-grained perception of the physical world and enabling more precise
interactions. To mitigate the scarcity of annotated 3D datasets, we propose an
egocentric video based pipeline for generating embodied cognition data.
Furthermore, we introduce RynnEC-Bench, a region-centered benchmark for
evaluating embodied cognitive capabilities. We anticipate that RynnEC will
advance the development of general-purpose cognitive cores for embodied agents
and facilitate generalization across diverse embodied tasks. The code, model
checkpoints, and benchmark are available at:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出深度均衡规范化器(DEC)来解决计算机视觉中的尺度变化问题，通过提高模型的局部尺度等变性来改善性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 计算机视觉中物体尺度变化是基本挑战，同类物体可能有不同大小，且受相机距离影响，这些变化是局部的，需要有效处理尺度变化

Method: 开发深度均衡规范化器(DEC)，可轻松集成到现有网络架构中，并能适配预训练模型，提高局部尺度等变性

Result: 在竞争性的ImageNet基准测试中，DEC提高了四个流行预训练深度网络(ViT、DeiT、Swin、BEiT)的模型性能和局部尺度一致性

Conclusion: DEC是处理尺度变化的有效方法，能够显著提升现有模型的性能和尺度一致性表现

Abstract: Scale variation is a fundamental challenge in computer vision. Objects of the
same class can have different sizes, and their perceived size is further
affected by the distance from the camera. These variations are local to the
objects, i.e., different object sizes may change differently within the same
image. To effectively handle scale variations, we present a deep equilibrium
canonicalizer (DEC) to improve the local scale equivariance of a model. DEC can
be easily incorporated into existing network architectures and can be adapted
to a pre-trained model. Notably, we show that on the competitive ImageNet
benchmark, DEC improves both model performance and local scale consistency
across four popular pre-trained deep-nets, e.g., ViT, DeiT, Swin, and BEiT. Our
code is available at https://github.com/ashiq24/local-scale-equivariance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CLIPSym是一个利用CLIP预训练模型进行对称性检测的新方法，通过语义感知提示分组和旋转等变解码器，在多个标准数据集上达到了最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对称性是计算机视觉中最基本的几何线索之一，但检测对称性一直是个挑战。研究探索预训练的CLIP模型是否能通过自然图像描述中的对称线索来辅助对称检测。

Method: 提出CLIPSym方法，利用CLIP的图像和语言编码器，以及基于Transformer和G-卷积混合的旋转等变解码器来检测旋转和反射对称性。开发了语义感知提示分组(SAPG)技术来聚合多样化的对象提示。

Result: 在三个标准对称检测数据集(DENDI、SDRW和LDRS)上超越了当前最先进的方法。消融实验验证了CLIP预训练、等变解码器和SAPG技术的有效性。

Conclusion: CLIPSym成功证明了预训练视觉语言模型在对称检测任务中的价值，通过创新的提示技术和等变架构设计，为对称性检测提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Symmetry is one of the most fundamental geometric cues in computer vision,
and detecting it has been an ongoing challenge. With the recent advances in
vision-language models,~i.e., CLIP, we investigate whether a pre-trained CLIP
model can aid symmetry detection by leveraging the additional symmetry cues
found in the natural image descriptions. We propose CLIPSym, which leverages
CLIP's image and language encoders and a rotation-equivariant decoder based on
a hybrid of Transformer and $G$-Convolution to detect rotation and reflection
symmetries. To fully utilize CLIP's language encoder, we have developed a novel
prompting technique called Semantic-Aware Prompt Grouping (SAPG), which
aggregates a diverse set of frequent object-based prompts to better integrate
the semantic cues for symmetry detection. Empirically, we show that CLIPSym
outperforms the current state-of-the-art on three standard symmetry detection
datasets (DENDI, SDRW, and LDRS). Finally, we conduct detailed ablations
verifying the benefits of CLIP's pre-training, the proposed equivariant
decoder, and the SAPG technique. The code is available at
https://github.com/timyoung2333/CLIPSym.

Abstract: Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) has emerged as a pivotal task in computer
vision, with broad relevance across multiple fields. Recent advances in deep
learning have driven significant progress in this area, yet the field remains
fragmented across domains and learning paradigms. This survey offers a
comprehensive perspective on VAD, systematically organizing the literature
across various supervision levels, as well as adaptive learning methods such as
online, active, and continual learning. We examine the state of VAD across
three major application categories: human-centric, vehicle-centric, and
environment-centric scenarios, each with distinct challenges and design
considerations. In doing so, we identify fundamental contributions and
limitations of current methodologies. By consolidating insights from subfields,
we aim to provide the community with a structured foundation for advancing both
theoretical understanding and real-world applicability of VAD systems. This
survey aims to support researchers by providing a useful reference, while also
drawing attention to the broader set of open challenges in anomaly detection,
including both fundamental research questions and practical obstacles to
real-world deployment.

### [8] [Accelerating Image Classification with Graph Convolutional Neural Networks using Voronoi Diagrams](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14218)
*Mustafa Mohammadi Gharasuie,Luis Rueda*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合Voronoi图和GCN的新型图像分类框架NVGCN，在多个基准数据集上显著提升了预处理时间和分类精度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统卷积神经网络在处理复杂数据结构时存在局限，需要新的范式来处理图像中的关系数据

Method: 使用基于图的图像表示方法，将像素或区域视为图顶点，通过Delaunay三角剖分简化，并提出了归一化Voronoi图卷积网络(NVGCN)

Result: 在多个基准数据集上超越了现有最先进模型，特别是在复杂场景和细粒度分类任务中表现优异，预处理时间显著减少

Conclusion: 该研究为图像分类引入了新方法，为计算机视觉和非结构化数据领域的图基学习范式开辟了新途径

Abstract: Recent advances in image classification have been significantly propelled by
the integration of Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs), offering a novel
paradigm for handling complex data structures. This study introduces an
innovative framework that employs GCNs in conjunction with Voronoi diagrams to
peform image classification, leveraging their exceptional capability to model
relational data. Unlike conventional convolutional neural networks, our
approach utilizes a graph-based representation of images, where pixels or
regions are treated as vertices of a graph, which are then simplified in the
form of the corresponding Delaunay triangulations. Our model yields significant
improvement in pre-processing time and classification accuracy on several
benchmark datasets, surpassing existing state-of-the-art models, especially in
scenarios that involve complex scenes and fine-grained categories. The
experimental results, validated via cross-validation, underscore the potential
of integrating GCNs with Voronoi diagrams in advancing image classification
tasks. This research contributes to the field by introducing a novel approach
to image classification, while opening new avenues for developing graph-based
learning paradigms in other domains of computer vision and non-structured data.
In particular, we have proposed a new version of the GCN in this paper, namely
normalized Voronoi Graph Convolution Network (NVGCN), which is faster than the
regular GCN.

Main category: cs.CV

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型多模态模型在理解任务中表现优异，但仍存在鲁棒性和泛化性方面的基本限制，主要源于视觉和文本特征之间的对齐和相关性不足。

Method: 在预训练和微调阶段引入两个新任务：重建图像顺序和文本顺序；提出directed-token方法捕获视觉和文本知识；引入Image-to-Response Guided损失函数改善视觉理解。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法通过改进视觉-文本模态的鲁棒对齐，有效提升了多模态模型的推理能力、视觉理解和跨模态对齐性能。

Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) have gained impressive performance due to
their outstanding capability in various understanding tasks. However, these
models still suffer from some fundamental limitations related to robustness and
generalization due to the alignment and correlation between visual and textual
features. In this paper, we introduce a simple but efficient learning mechanism
for improving the robust alignment between visual and textual modalities by
solving shuffling problems. In particular, the proposed approach can improve
reasoning capability, visual understanding, and cross-modality alignment by
introducing two new tasks: reconstructing the image order and the text order
into the LMM's pre-training and fine-tuning phases. In addition, we propose a
new directed-token approach to capture visual and textual knowledge, enabling
the capability to reconstruct the correct order of visual inputs. Then, we
introduce a new Image-to-Response Guided loss to further improve the visual
understanding of the LMM in its responses. The proposed approach consistently
achieves state-of-the-art (SoTA) performance compared with prior LMMs on
academic task-oriented and instruction-following LMM benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究系统分析了不同数据增强策略对糖尿病视网膜病变分级中保形预测器性能的影响，发现样本混合策略（Mixup和CutMix）不仅能提高预测精度，还能产生更可靠和高效的不确定性估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型在糖尿病视网膜病变分级等高风险任务中需要可靠的不确定性量化。虽然保形预测能提供统计保证的预测集，但标准训练实践（如数据增强）与这些保证有效性之间的相互作用尚不明确。

Method: 使用DDR数据集，评估ResNet-50和CoaT Transformer两种架构在五种增强策略下的表现：无增强、标准几何变换、CLAHE、Mixup和CutMix，分析对保形预测指标的影响。

Result: 样本混合策略（Mixup和CutMix）不仅提高了预测准确性，还产生了更可靠和高效的不确定性估计；而CLAHE等方法可能对模型确定性产生负面影响。

Conclusion: 需要将增强策略与下游不确定性量化协同设计，以构建真正值得信赖的医学影像AI系统。

Abstract: The clinical deployment of deep learning models for high-stakes tasks such as
diabetic retinopathy (DR) grading requires demonstrable reliability. While
models achieve high accuracy, their clinical utility is limited by a lack of
robust uncertainty quantification. Conformal prediction (CP) offers a
distribution-free framework to generate prediction sets with statistical
guarantees of coverage. However, the interaction between standard training
practices like data augmentation and the validity of these guarantees is not
well understood. In this study, we systematically investigate how different
data augmentation strategies affect the performance of conformal predictors for
DR grading. Using the DDR dataset, we evaluate two backbone architectures --
ResNet-50 and a Co-Scale Conv-Attentional Transformer (CoaT) -- trained under
five augmentation regimes: no augmentation, standard geometric transforms,
CLAHE, Mixup, and CutMix. We analyze the downstream effects on conformal
metrics, including empirical coverage, average prediction set size, and correct
efficiency. Our results demonstrate that sample-mixing strategies like Mixup
and CutMix not only improve predictive accuracy but also yield more reliable
and efficient uncertainty estimates. Conversely, methods like CLAHE can
negatively impact model certainty. These findings highlight the need to
co-design augmentation strategies with downstream uncertainty quantification in
mind to build genuinely trustworthy AI systems for medical imaging.

Abstract: Despite the growing importance of dental CBCT scans for diagnosis and
treatment planning, generating anatomically realistic scans with fine-grained
control remains a challenge in medical image synthesis. In this work, we
propose a novel conditional diffusion framework for 3D dental volume
generation, guided by tooth-level binary attributes that allow precise control
over tooth presence and configuration. Our approach integrates wavelet-based
denoising diffusion, FiLM conditioning, and masked loss functions to focus
learning on relevant anatomical structures. We evaluate the model across
diverse tasks, such as tooth addition, removal, and full dentition synthesis,
using both paired and distributional similarity metrics. Results show strong
fidelity and generalization with low FID scores, robust inpainting performance,
and SSIM values above 0.91 even on unseen scans. By enabling realistic,
localized modification of dentition without rescanning, this work opens
opportunities for surgical planning, patient communication, and targeted data
augmentation in dental AI workflows. The codes are available at:

Conclusion: GALA框架通过创新的特征学习和内存优化设计，成功实现了高效的开放词汇3D场景理解

Abstract: 3D scene reconstruction and understanding have gained increasing popularity,
yet existing methods still struggle to capture fine-grained, language-aware 3D
representations from 2D images. In this paper, we present GALA, a novel
framework for open-vocabulary 3D scene understanding with 3D Gaussian Splatting
(3DGS). GALA distills a scene-specific 3D instance feature field via
self-supervised contrastive learning. To extend to generalized language feature
fields, we introduce the core contribution of GALA, a cross-attention module
with two learnable codebooks that encode view-independent semantic embeddings.
This design not only ensures intra-instance feature similarity but also
supports seamless 2D and 3D open-vocabulary queries. It reduces memory
consumption by avoiding per-Gaussian high-dimensional feature learning.
Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate GALA's remarkable
open-vocabulary performance on both 2D and 3D.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖基于提示的条件化，受限于CLIP文本编码器的局限性，且通常只提供单一、嘈杂的理由，无法捕捉判别性图像特征的多样性。

Method: 提出对比条件推理（CCI）框架，显式建模图像嵌入、类别标签和理由之间的概率关系，无需训练即可实现更有效的理由条件化。

Conclusion: 该工作与基准一起为可解释物体识别提供了更完整的评估框架，代码将在线提供。

Abstract: Explainable object recognition using vision-language models such as CLIP
involves predicting accurate category labels supported by rationales that
justify the decision-making process. Existing methods typically rely on
prompt-based conditioning, which suffers from limitations in CLIP's text
encoder and provides weak conditioning on explanatory structures. Additionally,
prior datasets are often restricted to single, and frequently noisy, rationales
that fail to capture the full diversity of discriminative image features. In
this work, we introduce a multi-rationale explainable object recognition
benchmark comprising datasets in which each image is annotated with multiple
ground-truth rationales, along with evaluation metrics designed to offer a more
comprehensive representation of the task. To overcome the limitations of
previous approaches, we propose a contrastive conditional inference (CCI)
framework that explicitly models the probabilistic relationships among image
embeddings, category labels, and rationales. Without requiring any training,
our framework enables more effective conditioning on rationales to predict
accurate object categories. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on
the multi-rationale explainable object recognition benchmark, including strong
zero-shot performance, and sets a new standard for both classification accuracy
and rationale quality. Together with the benchmark, this work provides a more
complete framework for evaluating future models in explainable object
recognition. The code will be made available online.

Abstract: Accurate detection of vascular occlusions during endovascular thrombectomy
(EVT) is critical in acute ischemic stroke (AIS). Interpretation of digital
subtraction angiography (DSA) sequences poses challenges due to anatomical
complexity and time constraints. This work proposes OccluNet, a spatio-temporal
deep learning model that integrates YOLOX, a single-stage object detector, with
transformer-based temporal attention mechanisms to automate occlusion detection
in DSA sequences. We compared OccluNet with a YOLOv11 baseline trained on
either individual DSA frames or minimum intensity projections. Two
spatio-temporal variants were explored for OccluNet: pure temporal attention
and divided space-time attention. Evaluation on DSA images from the MR CLEAN
Registry revealed the model's capability to capture temporally consistent
features, achieving precision and recall of 89.02% and 74.87%, respectively.
OccluNet significantly outperformed the baseline models, and both attention
variants attained similar performance. Source code is available at

*Yuguang Yue,Chris Green,Samuel Hunt,Irakli Salia,Wenzhe Shi,Jonathan J Hunt*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Pixels2Play-0.1是一个基础模型，通过像素输入学习玩多种3D游戏，具有类人行为，使用行为克隆和逆动力学模型训练，能在消费级GPU上实现低延迟游戏控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 满足AI队友、可控NPC、个性化直播和辅助测试等新兴需求，需要能够基于玩家可见的像素流进行游戏，并以最少游戏特定工程泛化到新游戏。

Method: 端到端行为克隆训练，结合人工标注演示数据和未标注公共视频数据（通过逆动力学模型推断动作），使用仅解码器transformer架构实现自回归动作输出。

Result: 在简单Roblox和经典MS-DOS游戏中表现出色，展示了未标注数据的重要性，具备在消费级单GPU上的低延迟性能。

Conclusion: 模型展示了跨游戏泛化能力，为达到专家级文本条件控制奠定了基础，需要进一步扩展规模和评估方法。

Abstract: We introduce Pixels2Play-0.1 (P2P0.1), a foundation model that learns to play
a wide range of 3D video games with recognizable human-like behavior. Motivated
by emerging consumer and developer use cases - AI teammates, controllable NPCs,
personalized live-streamers, assistive testers - we argue that an agent must
rely on the same pixel stream available to players and generalize to new titles
with minimal game-specific engineering. P2P0.1 is trained end-to-end with
behavior cloning: labeled demonstrations collected from instrumented human
game-play are complemented by unlabeled public videos, to which we impute
actions via an inverse-dynamics model. A decoder-only transformer with
auto-regressive action output handles the large action space while remaining
latency-friendly on a single consumer GPU. We report qualitative results
showing competent play across simple Roblox and classic MS-DOS titles,
ablations on unlabeled data, and outline the scaling and evaluation steps
required to reach expert-level, text-conditioned control.

TL;DR: 提出了一种统一的多模态多视角视频生成方法，用于自动驾驶场景合成，能够同时生成RGB视频、深度图和语义图等多种模态数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的自动驾驶视频生成方法主要关注RGB视频生成，缺乏多模态生成能力。而多模态数据（如深度图和语义图）对自动驾驶的整体场景理解至关重要。使用多个模型生成不同模态会增加部署难度且无法利用多模态数据的互补线索。

Conclusion: 提出的统一框架成功解决了自动驾驶场景中多模态视频生成的挑战，为自动驾驶系统提供了更全面的场景理解能力。

Abstract: Video generation has recently shown superiority in urban scene synthesis for
autonomous driving. Existing video generation approaches to autonomous driving
primarily focus on RGB video generation and lack the ability to support
multi-modal video generation. However, multi-modal data, such as depth maps and
semantic maps, are crucial for holistic urban scene understanding in autonomous
driving. Although it is feasible to use multiple models to generate different
modalities, this increases the difficulty of model deployment and does not
leverage complementary cues for multi-modal data generation. To address this
problem, in this work, we propose a novel multi-modal multi-view video
generation approach to autonomous driving. Specifically, we construct a unified
diffusion transformer model composed of modal-shared components and
modal-specific components. Then, we leverage diverse conditioning inputs to
encode controllable scene structure and content cues into the unified diffusion
model for multi-modal multi-view video generation. In this way, our approach is
capable of generating multi-modal multi-view driving scene videos in a unified
framework. Our experiments on the challenging real-world autonomous driving
dataset, nuScenes, show that our approach can generate multi-modal multi-view
urban scene videos with high fidelity and controllability, surpassing the
state-of-the-art methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新的跨类利益关系损失函数（ICR），通过利用对象间的空间关系来改善小目标检测的梯度更新效果，并为许可证检测创建了一个新的数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的IoU基础损失函数在小目标检测中存在梯度更新效果差的问题，导致小对象学习效率低下。论文主要解决小目标检测中的梯度更新问题。

Method: 提出了跨类利益关系损失函数（ICR），利用对象间的空间关系（如车牌与汽车的位置关系）来指导小对象的学习。当预测的小对象缝框不在关联的大对象内时，添加损失惩罚，该惩罚与重叠面积成反比。

Result: 在YOLOv12-T和UAV-DETR模型上，mAP$^{\text{test}}_{50}$指标分别提升10.3%和1.6%，而不需要额外的超参数调整。还创建了一个新的小型车辆多车牌数据集（SVMLP）。

Conclusion: 这种跨类利益关系损失函数可以简单地添加到现有的IoU基础损失中，显著提高小对象检测的性能，特别是在许可证检测任务中。

Abstract: In one-stage multi-object detection tasks, various intersection over union
(IoU)-based solutions aim at smooth and stable convergence near the targets
during training. However, IoU-based losses fail to correctly update the
gradient of small objects due to an extremely flat gradient. During the update
of multiple objects, the learning of small objects' gradients suffers more
because of insufficient gradient updates. Therefore, we propose an inter-class
relational loss to efficiently update the gradient of small objects while not
sacrificing the learning efficiency of other objects based on the simple fact
that an object has a spatial relationship to another object (e.g., a car plate
is attached to a car in a similar position). When the predicted car plate's
bounding box is not within its car, a loss punishment is added to guide the
learning, which is inversely proportional to the overlapped area of the car's
and predicted car plate's bounding box. By leveraging the spatial relationship
at the inter-class level, the loss guides small object predictions using larger
objects and enhances latent information in deeper feature maps. In this paper,
we present twofold contributions using license plate detection as a case study:
(1) a new small vehicle multi-license plate dataset (SVMLP), featuring diverse
real-world scenarios with high-quality annotations; and (2) a novel inter-class
relational loss function designed to promote effective detection performance.
We highlight the proposed ICR loss penalty can be easily added to existing
IoU-based losses and enhance the performance. These contributions improve the
standard mean Average Precision (mAP) metric, achieving gains of 10.3% and 1.6%
in mAP$^{\text{test}}_{50}$ for YOLOv12-T and UAV-DETR, respectively, without
any additional hyperparameter tuning. Code and dataset will be available soon.

accuracy, establishing new state-of-the-art results for the LSFB and DiSPLaY

Our approach democratizes sign generation and synthetic data pretraining for
SLR by providing computationally efficient methods that achieve significant

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文提供了一个新的微粒镜图像数据集，用于自动化分析C6脒瘤细胞在化疗药Taxol作用下的形态变化，并提出了基线模型ResAttention-KNN来进行药物浓度分类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前监测Taxol药效的方法需要专业设备和复杂的样品处理，成本高且不适合高速通量分析。深度学习在医学图像分析中展现了强大潜力，但缺乏相关的公开数据集。

Method: 建立了包含不同Taxol浓度处理的C6脒瘤细胞微粒图像数据集，并提出ResAttention-KNN基线模型，结合ResNet-50、卷积注意力模块和k近邻分类器。

Result: 这个公开数据集和基线模型为自动化化疗药效析探索提供了基础，支持可复现性研究和未来的视觉化生物医学分析。

Conclusion: 该研究填补了Taxol药效自动化分析领域的数据集空白，通过新的注意力模型提供了高效、可解释的分析方案，促进了高速通量化疗药效评估的发展。

Abstract: Monitoring the effects of the chemotherapeutic agent Taxol at the cellular
level is critical for both clinical evaluation and biomedical research.
However, existing detection methods require specialized equipment, skilled
personnel, and extensive sample preparation, making them expensive,
labor-intensive, and unsuitable for high-throughput or real-time analysis. Deep
learning approaches have shown great promise in medical and biological image
analysis, enabling automated, high-throughput assessment of cellular
morphology. Yet, no publicly available dataset currently exists for automated
morphological analysis of cellular responses to Taxol exposure. To address this
gap, we introduce a new microscopy image dataset capturing C6 glioma cells
treated with varying concentrations of Taxol. To provide an effective solution
for Taxol concentration classification and establish a benchmark for future
studies on this dataset, we propose a baseline model named ResAttention-KNN,
which combines a ResNet-50 with Convolutional Block Attention Modules and uses
a k-Nearest Neighbors classifier in the learned embedding space. This model
integrates attention-based refinement and non-parametric classification to
enhance robustness and interpretability. Both the dataset and implementation
are publicly released to support reproducibility and facilitate future research
in vision-based biomedical analysis.

TL;DR: HRC-Pose是一个基于深度学习的类别级物体姿态估计框架，通过对比学习保持6D姿态连续性，在旋转和平移分量上分别处理，在REAL275和CAMERA25基准测试中优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法仅依赖6D姿态作为监督信号，没有显式捕捉姿态的内在连续性，导致预测不一致和对未见姿态泛化能力降低。

Method: 提出HRC-Pose深度框架，使用对比学习学习点云表示，解耦旋转和平移分量分别编码，基于6D姿态感知的层次排序方案设计多任务多类别对比学习策略。

Result: 在REAL275和CAMERA25基准测试中一致优于现有深度学习方法，能够实时运行，成功学习到连续特征空间。

Conclusion: HRC-Pose通过对比学习有效解决了姿态连续性问题，在类别级物体姿态估计任务中表现出色，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Category-level object pose estimation aims to predict the 6D pose and 3D size
of objects within given categories. Existing approaches for this task rely
solely on 6D poses as supervisory signals without explicitly capturing the
intrinsic continuity of poses, leading to inconsistencies in predictions and
reduced generalization to unseen poses. To address this limitation, we propose
HRC-Pose, a novel depth-only framework for category-level object pose
estimation, which leverages contrastive learning to learn point cloud
representations that preserve the continuity of 6D poses. HRC-Pose decouples
object pose into rotation and translation components, which are separately
encoded and leveraged throughout the network. Specifically, we introduce a
contrastive learning strategy for multi-task, multi-category scenarios based on
our 6D pose-aware hierarchical ranking scheme, which contrasts point clouds
from multiple categories by considering rotational and translational
differences as well as categorical information. We further design pose
estimation modules that separately process the learned rotation-aware and
translation-aware embeddings. Our experiments demonstrate that HRC-Pose
successfully learns continuous feature spaces. Results on REAL275 and CAMERA25
benchmarks show that our method consistently outperforms existing depth-only
state-of-the-art methods and runs in real-time, demonstrating its effectiveness
and potential for real-world applications. Our code is at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决情感可控说话人脸生成的两个关键挑战：如何有效建模与特定情感相关的多模态关系，以及如何利用这种关系合成保持身份特征的情感视频

Method: 采用两种预训练策略解耦音频为独立组件并量化视频为视觉标记组合；提出情感锚点表示将情感信息整合到视觉标记中；使用自回归变换器建模视觉标记的全局分布并预测索引序列

Result: 在MEAD数据集上进行实验，通过多情感音频条件控制视频情感，定性和定量实验均证明了方法的优越性

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效实现情感可控的说话人脸生成，在保持身份特征的同时合成生动的情绪化说话视频

Abstract: Talking face generation is a novel and challenging generation task, aiming at
synthesizing a vivid speaking-face video given a specific audio. To fulfill
emotion-controllable talking face generation, current methods need to overcome
two challenges: One is how to effectively model the multimodal relationship
related to the specific emotion, and the other is how to leverage this
relationship to synthesize identity preserving emotional videos. In this paper,
we propose a novel method to tackle the emotion-controllable talking face
generation task discretely. Specifically, we employ two pre-training strategies
to disentangle audio into independent components and quantize videos into
combinations of visual tokens. Subsequently, we propose the emotion-anchor (EA)
representation that integrates the emotional information into visual tokens.
Finally, we introduce an autoregressive transformer to model the global
distribution of the visual tokens under the given conditions and further
predict the index sequence for synthesizing the manipulated videos. We conduct
experiments on the MEAD dataset that controls the emotion of videos conditioned
on multiple emotional audios. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
superiorities of our method both qualitatively and quantitatively.

Motivation: 传统的多目标跟踪系统主要针对行人跟踪，对其他物体类别的泛化能力有限，需要开发能够处理多种物体类型的通用跟踪框架。

Method: 包含两个关键组件：(1)遮挡感知重识别机制，增强对严重遮挡物体的身份保持；(2)道路结构感知轨迹优化策略，利用车道方向、人行横道、道路边界等语义场景先验来改善轨迹连续性和准确性。

Conclusion: 该框架不仅适用于通用的多类跟踪，在传统基准测试中也表现出强大性能，证明了其在通用目标跟踪中的有效性。

Abstract: Conventional multi-object tracking (MOT) systems are predominantly designed
for pedestrian tracking and often exhibit limited generalization to other
object categories. This paper presents a generalized tracking framework capable
of handling multiple object types, with a particular emphasis on vehicle
tracking in complex traffic scenes. The proposed method incorporates two key
components: (1) an occlusion-aware re-identification mechanism that enhances
identity preservation for heavily occluded objects, and (2) a
road-structure-aware tracklet refinement strategy that utilizes semantic scene
priors such as lane directions, crosswalks, and road boundaries to improve
trajectory continuity and accuracy. In addition, we introduce a new benchmark
dataset comprising diverse vehicle classes with frame-level tracking
annotations, specifically curated to support evaluation of vehicle-focused
tracking methods. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed
approach achieves robust performance on both the newly introduced dataset and
several public benchmarks, highlighting its effectiveness in general-purpose
object tracking. While our framework is designed for generalized multi-class
tracking, it also achieves strong performance on conventional benchmarks, with
HOTA scores of 66.4 on MOT17 and 65.7 on MOT20 test sets. Code and Benchmark

Abstract: Computer-aided surgical simulation is a critical component of orthognathic
surgical planning, where accurately simulating face-bone shape transformations
is significant. The traditional biomechanical simulation methods are limited by
their computational time consumption levels, labor-intensive data processing
strategies and low accuracy. Recently, deep learning-based simulation methods
have been proposed to view this problem as a point-to-point transformation
between skeletal and facial point clouds. However, these approaches cannot
process large-scale points, have limited receptive fields that lead to noisy
points, and employ complex preprocessing and postprocessing operations based on
registration. These shortcomings limit the performance and widespread
applicability of such methods. Therefore, we propose a Transformer-based
coarse-to-fine point movement network (TCFNet) to learn unique, complicated
correspondences at the patch and point levels for dense face-bone point cloud
transformations. This end-to-end framework adopts a Transformer-based network
and a local information aggregation network (LIA-Net) in the first and second
stages, respectively, which reinforce each other to generate precise point
movement paths. LIA-Net can effectively compensate for the neighborhood
precision loss of the Transformer-based network by modeling local geometric
structures (edges, orientations and relative position features). The previous
global features are employed to guide the local displacement using a gated
recurrent unit. Inspired by deformable medical image registration, we propose
an auxiliary loss that can utilize expert knowledge for reconstructing critical
organs.Compared with the existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on gathered
datasets, TCFNet achieves outstanding evaluation metrics and visualization
results. The code is available at https://github.com/Runshi-Zhang/TCFNet.

Result: 在FPGA和28nm ASIC上实现，相比现有方法PSNR提升最高2.06dB，面积仅1914μm²，动态功耗6.14mW，资源消耗降低97%，功耗降低97%，延迟改善93%

Conclusion: QuadINR通过硬件友好的分段二次激活函数成功解决了隐式神经表示中的频谱偏差问题，在保持高性能的同时大幅降低了硬件开销，为高效INR实现提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) encode discrete signals continuously
while addressing spectral bias through activation functions (AFs). Previous
approaches mitigate this bias by employing complex AFs, which often incur
significant hardware overhead. To tackle this challenge, we introduce QuadINR,
a hardware-efficient INR that utilizes piecewise quadratic AFs to achieve
superior performance with dramatic reductions in hardware consumption. The
quadratic functions encompass rich harmonic content in their Fourier series,
delivering enhanced expressivity for high-frequency signals, as verified
through Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) analysis. We develop a unified $N$-stage
pipeline framework that facilitates efficient hardware implementation of
various AFs in INRs. We demonstrate FPGA implementations on the VCU128 platform
and an ASIC implementation in a 28nm process. Experiments across images and
videos show that QuadINR achieves up to 2.06dB PSNR improvement over prior
work, with an area of only 1914$\mu$m$^2$ and a dynamic power of 6.14mW,
reducing resource and power consumption by up to 97\% and improving latency by

Conclusion: Img2ST-Net为大规模高效准确的ST推断提供了原则性解决方案，为下一代鲁棒且分辨率感知的ST建模奠定了基础。

Abstract: Recent advances in multi-modal AI have demonstrated promising potential for
generating the currently expensive spatial transcriptomics (ST) data directly
from routine histology images, offering a means to reduce the high cost and
time-intensive nature of ST data acquisition. However, the increasing
resolution of ST, particularly with platforms such as Visium HD achieving 8um
or finer, introduces significant computational and modeling challenges.
Conventional spot-by-spot sequential regression frameworks become inefficient
and unstable at this scale, while the inherent extreme sparsity and low
expression levels of high-resolution ST further complicate both prediction and
evaluation. To address these limitations, we propose Img2ST-Net, a novel
histology-to-ST generation framework for efficient and parallel high-resolution
ST prediction. Unlike conventional spot-by-spot inference methods, Img2ST-Net
employs a fully convolutional architecture to generate dense, HD gene
expression maps in a parallelized manner. By modeling HD ST data as super-pixel
representations, the task is reformulated from image-to-omics inference into a
super-content image generation problem with hundreds or thousands of output
channels. This design not only improves computational efficiency but also
better preserves the spatial organization intrinsic to spatial omics data. To
enhance robustness under sparse expression patterns, we further introduce
SSIM-ST, a structural-similarity-based evaluation metric tailored for
high-resolution ST analysis. We present a scalable, biologically coherent
framework for high-resolution ST prediction. Img2ST-Net offers a principled
solution for efficient and accurate ST inference at scale. Our contributions
lay the groundwork for next-generation ST modeling that is robust and
resolution-aware. The source code has been made publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Flux等英文训练的文本生成图像模型在处理非英文提示时表现不佳，现有翻译或双语微调方法无法充分处理文化特定语义，影响图像真实性和质量。

Method: 采用MultiModal Diffusion Transformer (MMDiT)架构直接控制Flux主干模型，减少参数量同时增强中文语义理解能力，保持与现有插件的兼容性。

Result: 实证评估显示CTA-Flux支持中英文提示，在图像生成质量、视觉真实性和中文语义忠实度方面表现优异。

Conclusion: CTA-Flux有效解决了英文中心TTI模型的中文语义理解问题，在不完全重训练的情况下显著提升了生成质量和文化真实性。

Abstract: We proposed the Chinese Text Adapter-Flux (CTA-Flux). An adaptation method
fits the Chinese text inputs to Flux, a powerful text-to-image (TTI) generative
model initially trained on the English corpus. Despite the notable image
generation ability conditioned on English text inputs, Flux performs poorly
when processing non-English prompts, particularly due to linguistic and
cultural biases inherent in predominantly English-centric training datasets.
Existing approaches, such as translating non-English prompts into English or
finetuning models for bilingual mappings, inadequately address culturally
specific semantics, compromising image authenticity and quality. To address
this issue, we introduce a novel method to bridge Chinese semantic
understanding with compatibility in English-centric TTI model communities.
Existing approaches relying on ControlNet-like architectures typically require
a massive parameter scale and lack direct control over Chinese semantics. In
comparison, CTA-flux leverages MultiModal Diffusion Transformer (MMDiT) to
control the Flux backbone directly, significantly reducing the number of
parameters while enhancing the model's understanding of Chinese semantics. This
integration significantly improves the generation quality and cultural
authenticity without extensive retraining of the entire model, thus maintaining
compatibility with existing text-to-image plugins such as LoRA, IP-Adapter, and
ControlNet. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that CTA-flux supports Chinese
and English prompts and achieves superior image generation quality, visual
realism, and faithful depiction of Chinese semantics.

Method: 提出MoCHA-former模型，包含解耦摩尔纹自适应去摩尔纹(DMAD)和时空自适应去摩尔纹(STAD)两个核心组件，使用Moiré Decoupling Block分离摩尔纹和内容，通过Spatial Fusion Block捕获大尺度结构，Feature Channel Attention处理通道依赖，并实现隐式帧对齐。

Result: 在两个视频数据集(RAW和sRGB域)上的评估显示，MoCHA-former在PSNR、SSIM和LPIPS指标上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MoCHA-former通过创新的解耦和自适应机制，有效解决了屏幕拍摄中的摩尔纹问题，在定量和定性评估中都表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in portable imaging have made camera-based screen capture
ubiquitous. Unfortunately, frequency aliasing between the camera's color filter
array (CFA) and the display's sub-pixels induces moir\'e patterns that severely
degrade captured photos and videos. Although various demoir\'eing models have
been proposed to remove such moir\'e patterns, these approaches still suffer
from several limitations: (i) spatially varying artifact strength within a
frame, (ii) large-scale and globally spreading structures, (iii)
channel-dependent statistics and (iv) rapid temporal fluctuations across
frames. We address these issues with the Moir\'e Conditioned Hybrid Adaptive
Transformer (MoCHA-former), which comprises two key components: Decoupled
Moir\'e Adaptive Demoir\'eing (DMAD) and Spatio-Temporal Adaptive Demoir\'eing
(STAD). DMAD separates moir\'e and content via a Moir\'e Decoupling Block (MDB)
and a Detail Decoupling Block (DDB), then produces moir\'e-adaptive features
using a Moir\'e Conditioning Block (MCB) for targeted restoration. STAD
introduces a Spatial Fusion Block (SFB) with window attention to capture
large-scale structures, and a Feature Channel Attention (FCA) to model channel
dependence in RAW frames. To ensure temporal consistency, MoCHA-former performs
implicit frame alignment without any explicit alignment module. We analyze
moir\'e characteristics through qualitative and quantitative studies, and
evaluate on two video datasets covering RAW and sRGB domains. MoCHA-former
consistently surpasses prior methods across PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS.

TL;DR: HyperDiff是一种新颖的单目3D人体姿态估计方法，结合扩散模型和HyperGCN来解决深度模糊和遮挡问题，在多个数据集上达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单目3D人体姿态估计面临深度模糊和遮挡挑战，传统方法在处理多尺度骨架特征时存在不足，影响姿态估计精度。

Method: 提出HyperDiff方法，集成扩散模型和HyperGCN。扩散模型捕捉数据不确定性，缓解深度模糊和遮挡；HyperGCN作为去噪器，使用多粒度结构精确建模关节间的高阶相关性。

Result: 在Human3.6M和MPI-INF-3DHP数据集上实现最先进性能，能够灵活适应不同计算资源，平衡性能与效率。

Conclusion: HyperDiff通过结合扩散模型和超图卷积网络，有效解决了单目3D姿态估计中的关键挑战，在精度和适应性方面表现出色。

Abstract: Monocular 3D human pose estimation (HPE) often encounters challenges such as
depth ambiguity and occlusion during the 2D-to-3D lifting process.
Additionally, traditional methods may overlook multi-scale skeleton features
when utilizing skeleton structure information, which can negatively impact the
accuracy of pose estimation. To address these challenges, this paper introduces
a novel 3D pose estimation method, HyperDiff, which integrates diffusion models
with HyperGCN. The diffusion model effectively captures data uncertainty,
alleviating depth ambiguity and occlusion. Meanwhile, HyperGCN, serving as a
denoiser, employs multi-granularity structures to accurately model high-order
correlations between joints. This improves the model's denoising capability
especially for complex poses. Experimental results demonstrate that HyperDiff
achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP
datasets and can flexibly adapt to varying computational resources to balance
performance and efficiency.

TL;DR: FOCUS是一种基于频率调节的扩散驱动输入适应方法，通过分离高低频信息来平衡知识保持和域适应，在语义分割和深度估计任务上达到SOTA性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决测试时适应中平衡知识保持和域适应的挑战，防止模型在适应域偏移时遗忘任务相关知识

Method: 提出FOCUS方法，使用训练好的轻量级Y形频率预测网络(Y-FPN)从噪声图像中解耦高低频信息，结合FrequencyMix数据增强方法

Result: 在15种损坏类型和3个数据集上的语义分割和单目深度估计任务中达到最先进的平均性能，并能缓解现有模型适应方法的灾难性遗忘

Conclusion: FOCUS通过频率调节有效解决了测试时适应的知识保持问题，既能独立使用又能增强现有方法，具有很好的实用价值

Abstract: Test-time adaptation enables models to adapt to evolving domains. However,
balancing the tradeoff between preserving knowledge and adapting to domain
shifts remains challenging for model adaptation methods, since adapting to
domain shifts can induce forgetting of task-relevant knowledge. To address this
problem, we propose FOCUS, a novel frequency-based conditioning approach within
a diffusion-driven input-adaptation framework. Utilising learned, spatially
adaptive frequency priors, our approach conditions the reverse steps during
diffusion-driven denoising to preserve task-relevant semantic information for
dense prediction.
  FOCUS leverages a trained, lightweight, Y-shaped Frequency Prediction Network
(Y-FPN) that disentangles high and low frequency information from noisy images.
This minimizes the computational costs involved in implementing our approach in
a diffusion-driven framework. We train Y-FPN with FrequencyMix, a novel data
augmentation method that perturbs the images across diverse frequency bands,
which improves the robustness of our approach to diverse corruptions.
  We demonstrate the effectiveness of FOCUS for semantic segmentation and
monocular depth estimation across 15 corruption types and three datasets,
achieving state-of-the-art averaged performance. In addition to improving
standalone performance, FOCUS complements existing model adaptation methods
since we can derive pseudo labels from FOCUS-denoised images for additional
supervision. Even under limited, intermittent supervision with the pseudo
labels derived from the FOCUS denoised images, we show that FOCUS mitigates
catastrophic forgetting for recent model adaptation methods.

Conclusion: MUSE通过创新的CCA机制和训练策略，成功解决了布局可控多主体合成的关键挑战，为精确可控的图像合成提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Existing text-to-image diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in generating high-quality images guided by textual prompts.
However, achieving multi-subject compositional synthesis with precise spatial
control remains a significant challenge. In this work, we address the task of
layout-controllable multi-subject synthesis (LMS), which requires both faithful
reconstruction of reference subjects and their accurate placement in specified
regions within a unified image. While recent advancements have separately
improved layout control and subject synthesis, existing approaches struggle to
simultaneously satisfy the dual requirements of spatial precision and identity
preservation in this composite task. To bridge this gap, we propose MUSE, a
unified synthesis framework that employs concatenated cross-attention (CCA) to
seamlessly integrate layout specifications with textual guidance through
explicit semantic space expansion. The proposed CCA mechanism enables
bidirectional modality alignment between spatial constraints and textual
descriptions without interference. Furthermore, we design a progressive
two-stage training strategy that decomposes the LMS task into learnable
sub-objectives for effective optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that MUSE achieves zero-shot end-to-end generation with superior spatial
accuracy and identity consistency compared to existing solutions, advancing the
frontier of controllable image synthesis. Our code and model are available at

Motivation: 农业场景中的3D重建面临光照不均、遮挡和视野受限等独特挑战，现有3D高斯溅射方法在该领域应用不足，需要专门的多模态解决方案。

Method: 提出NIRSplat多模态高斯溅射架构，采用交叉注意力机制和3D点位置编码，整合近红外图像、RGB图像、深度、LiDAR数据以及基于植被指数的文本元数据。

Abstract: While 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has rapidly advanced, its application in
agriculture remains underexplored. Agricultural scenes present unique
challenges for 3D reconstruction methods, particularly due to uneven
illumination, occlusions, and a limited field of view. To address these
limitations, we introduce \textbf{NIRPlant}, a novel multimodal dataset
encompassing Near-Infrared (NIR) imagery, RGB imagery, textual metadata, Depth,
and LiDAR data collected under varied indoor and outdoor lighting conditions.
By integrating NIR data, our approach enhances robustness and provides crucial
botanical insights that extend beyond the visible spectrum. Additionally, we
leverage text-based metadata derived from vegetation indices, such as NDVI,
NDWI, and the chlorophyll index, which significantly enriches the contextual
understanding of complex agricultural environments. To fully exploit these
modalities, we propose \textbf{NIRSplat}, an effective multimodal Gaussian
splatting architecture employing a cross-attention mechanism combined with 3D
point-based positional encoding, providing robust geometric priors.
Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that \textbf{NIRSplat} outperforms
existing landmark methods, including 3DGS, CoR-GS, and InstantSplat,
highlighting its effectiveness in challenging agricultural scenarios. The code

Conclusion: DAPA通过显式的域适应和交互同步建模，有效解决了对话参与度估计的跨域泛化问题，为自适应人机交互系统提供了强有力的技术支撑

Abstract: Accurate engagement estimation is essential for adaptive human-computer
interaction systems, yet robust deployment is hindered by poor generalizability
across diverse domains and challenges in modeling complex interaction
dynamics.To tackle these issues, we propose DAPA (Domain-Adaptive Parallel
Attention), a novel framework for generalizable conversational engagement
modeling. DAPA introduces a Domain Prompting mechanism by prepending learnable
domain-specific vectors to the input, explicitly conditioning the model on the
data's origin to facilitate domain-aware adaptation while preserving
generalizable engagement representations. To capture interactional synchrony,
the framework also incorporates a Parallel Cross-Attention module that
explicitly aligns reactive (forward BiLSTM) and anticipatory (backward BiLSTM)
states between participants.Extensive experiments demonstrate that DAPA
establishes a new state-of-the-art performance on several cross-cultural and
cross-linguistic benchmarks, notably achieving an absolute improvement of 0.45
in Concordance Correlation Coefficient (CCC) over a strong baseline on the
NoXi-J test set. The superiority of our method was also confirmed by winning
the first place in the Multi-Domain Engagement Estimation Challenge at
MultiMediate'25.

Conclusion: 该方法通过解耦通用和个性化变形预测，有效解决了少样本3D说话头合成的挑战，提升了渲染质量和唇部同步精度。

Abstract: A key challenge in 3D talking head synthesis lies in the reliance on a
long-duration talking head video to train a new model for each target identity
from scratch. Recent methods have attempted to address this issue by extracting
general features from audio through pre-training models. However, since audio
contains information irrelevant to lip motion, existing approaches typically
struggle to map the given audio to realistic lip behaviors in the target face
when trained on only a few frames, causing poor lip synchronization and talking
head image quality. This paper proposes D^3-Talker, a novel approach that
constructs a static 3D Gaussian attribute field and employs audio and Facial
Motion signals to independently control two distinct Gaussian attribute
deformation fields, effectively decoupling the predictions of general and
personalized deformations. We design a novel similarity contrastive loss
function during pre-training to achieve more thorough decoupling. Furthermore,
we integrate a Coarse-to-Fine module to refine the rendered images, alleviating
blurriness caused by head movements and enhancing overall image quality.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that D^3-Talker outperforms state-of-the-art
methods in both high-fidelity rendering and accurate audio-lip synchronization
with limited training data. Our code will be provided upon acceptance.

Abstract: While multi-step diffusion models have advanced both forward and inverse
rendering, existing approaches often treat these problems independently,
leading to cycle inconsistency and slow inference speed. In this work, we
present Ouroboros, a framework composed of two single-step diffusion models
that handle forward and inverse rendering with mutual reinforcement. Our
approach extends intrinsic decomposition to both indoor and outdoor scenes and
introduces a cycle consistency mechanism that ensures coherence between forward
and inverse rendering outputs. Experimental results demonstrate
state-of-the-art performance across diverse scenes while achieving
substantially faster inference speed compared to other diffusion-based methods.
We also demonstrate that Ouroboros can transfer to video decomposition in a
training-free manner, reducing temporal inconsistency in video sequences while
maintaining high-quality per-frame inverse rendering.

Conclusion: DreamSwapV提供了一个有效的视频主题替换解决方案，通过创新的条件融合和自适应掩码策略，实现了高质量的主题定制化替换。

Abstract: With the rapid progress of video generation, demand for customized video
editing is surging, where subject swapping constitutes a key component yet
remains under-explored. Prevailing swapping approaches either specialize in
narrow domains--such as human-body animation or hand-object interaction--or
rely on some indirect editing paradigm or ambiguous text prompts that
compromise final fidelity. In this paper, we propose DreamSwapV, a mask-guided,
subject-agnostic, end-to-end framework that swaps any subject in any video for
customization with a user-specified mask and reference image. To inject
fine-grained guidance, we introduce multiple conditions and a dedicated
condition fusion module that integrates them efficiently. In addition, an
adaptive mask strategy is designed to accommodate subjects of varying scales
and attributes, further improving interactions between the swapped subject and
its surrounding context. Through our elaborate two-phase dataset construction
and training scheme, our DreamSwapV outperforms existing methods, as validated
by comprehensive experiments on VBench indicators and our first introduced
DreamSwapV-Benchmark.

Abstract: The ability to predict collision-free future trajectories from egocentric
observations is crucial in applications such as humanoid robotics, VR / AR, and
assistive navigation. In this work, we introduce the challenging problem of
predicting a sequence of future 6D head poses from an egocentric video. In
particular, we predict both head translations and rotations to learn the active
information-gathering behavior expressed through head-turning events. To solve
this task, we propose a framework that reasons over temporally aggregated 3D
latent features, which models the geometric and semantic constraints for both
the static and dynamic parts of the environment. Motivated by the lack of
training data in this space, we further contribute a data collection pipeline
using the Project Aria glasses, and present a dataset collected through this
approach. Our dataset, dubbed Aria Navigation Dataset (AND), consists of 4
hours of recording of users navigating in real-world scenarios. It includes
diverse situations and navigation behaviors, providing a valuable resource for
learning real-world egocentric navigation policies. Extensive experiments show
that our model learns human-like navigation behaviors such as waiting / slowing
down, rerouting, and looking around for traffic while generalizing to unseen
environments. Check out our project webpage at

Conclusion: Vivid-VR通过创新的训练策略和架构设计，有效解决了视频修复中的分布漂移问题，为生成式视频修复提供了高质量的解决方案。

Abstract: We present Vivid-VR, a DiT-based generative video restoration method built
upon an advanced T2V foundation model, where ControlNet is leveraged to control
the generation process, ensuring content consistency. However, conventional
fine-tuning of such controllable pipelines frequently suffers from distribution
drift due to limitations in imperfect multimodal alignment, resulting in
compromised texture realism and temporal coherence. To tackle this challenge,
we propose a concept distillation training strategy that utilizes the
pretrained T2V model to synthesize training samples with embedded textual
concepts, thereby distilling its conceptual understanding to preserve texture
and temporal quality. To enhance generation controllability, we redesign the
control architecture with two key components: 1) a control feature projector
that filters degradation artifacts from input video latents to minimize their
propagation through the generation pipeline, and 2) a new ControlNet connector
employing a dual-branch design. This connector synergistically combines
MLP-based feature mapping with cross-attention mechanism for dynamic control
feature retrieval, enabling both content preservation and adaptive control
signal modulation. Extensive experiments show that Vivid-VR performs favorably
against existing approaches on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks, as
well as AIGC videos, achieving impressive texture realism, visual vividness,
and temporal consistency. The codes and checkpoints are publicly available at

TL;DR: SATURN是一个轻量级的文本到图像生成模型扩展，通过将场景图转换为显著性排序的token序列，在保持VAR-CLIP主干网络冻结的情况下，仅微调VAR变换器，显著提升了复杂提示下的布局和对象关系捕捉能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本到图像模型在照片级渲染方面表现出色，但在处理复杂提示时难以准确捕捉布局和对象关系。虽然场景图提供了自然的结构先验，但之前的图引导方法依赖于繁重的GAN或扩散管道，在速度和保真度方面落后于现代自回归架构。

Method: SATURN是VAR-CLIP的轻量级扩展，将场景图转换为显著性排序的token序列，使冻结的CLIP-VQ-VAE主干网络能够解释图结构，同时仅对VAR变换器进行微调。

Result: 在Visual Genome数据集上，SATURN将FID从56.45%降低到21.62%，将Inception Score从16.03提高到24.78，优于SG2IM和SGDiff等先前方法，且无需额外模块或多阶段训练。定性结果进一步证实了在对象计数保真度和空间关系准确性方面的改进。

Conclusion: SATURN有效地将结构意识与最先进的自回归保真度相结合，展示了在保持高性能的同时简化模型架构的可行性。

Abstract: State-of-the-art text-to-image models excel at photorealistic rendering but
often struggle to capture the layout and object relationships implied by
complex prompts. Scene graphs provide a natural structural prior, yet previous
graph-guided approaches have typically relied on heavy GAN or diffusion
pipelines, which lag behind modern autoregressive architectures in both speed
and fidelity. We introduce SATURN (Structured Arrangement of Triplets for
Unified Rendering Networks), a lightweight extension to VAR-CLIP that
translates a scene graph into a salience-ordered token sequence, enabling a
frozen CLIP-VQ-VAE backbone to interpret graph structure while fine-tuning only
the VAR transformer. On the Visual Genome dataset, SATURN reduces FID from
56.45% to 21.62% and increases the Inception Score from 16.03 to 24.78,
outperforming prior methods such as SG2IM and SGDiff without requiring extra
modules or multi-stage training. Qualitative results further confirm
improvements in object count fidelity and spatial relation accuracy, showing
that SATURN effectively combines structural awareness with state-of-the-art
autoregressive fidelity.

Method: 提出PB-IAD框架，包含专门设计的提示模板和预处理模块，将领域用户输入转换为有效系统提示，利用GPT-4.1进行多模态异常检测

Result: 在三个制造场景、两种数据模态下评估，在数据稀疏和低样本设置中表现优异，超越PatchCore等先进方法

Conclusion: PB-IAD通过语义指令实现用户中心的设计，使领域专家无需数据科学专业知识即可灵活定制系统，为动态生产环境提供有效解决方案

Abstract: The detection of anomalies in manufacturing processes is crucial to ensure
product quality and identify process deviations. Statistical and data-driven
approaches remain the standard in industrial anomaly detection, yet their
adaptability and usability are constrained by the dependence on extensive
annotated datasets and limited flexibility under dynamic production conditions.
Recent advances in the perception capabilities of foundation models provide
promising opportunities for their adaptation to this downstream task. This
paper presents PB-IAD (Prompt-based Industrial Anomaly Detection), a novel
framework that leverages the multimodal and reasoning capabilities of
foundation models for industrial anomaly detection. Specifically, PB-IAD
addresses three key requirements of dynamic production environments: data
sparsity, agile adaptability, and domain user centricity. In addition to the
anomaly detection, the framework includes a prompt template that is
specifically designed for iteratively implementing domain-specific process
knowledge, as well as a pre-processing module that translates domain user
inputs into effective system prompts. This user-centric design allows domain
experts to customise the system flexibly without requiring data science
expertise. The proposed framework is evaluated by utilizing GPT-4.1 across
three distinct manufacturing scenarios, two data modalities, and an ablation
study to systematically assess the contribution of semantic instructions.
Furthermore, PB-IAD is benchmarked to state-of-the-art methods for anomaly
detection such as PatchCore. The results demonstrate superior performance,
particularly in data-sparse scenarios and low-shot settings, achieved solely
through semantic instructions.

TL;DR: ScenGE是一个通过大语言模型生成安全关键场景的框架，能够推理新颖的对抗性案例并通过复杂交通流进行放大，相比现有方法能发现更多严重碰撞案例


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前自动驾驶安全评估主要依赖预定义的威胁模式或基于规则的策略，无法暴露多样化和不可预见的故障模式，需要更有效的场景生成方法

Method: 采用Meta-Scenario Generation使用大语言模型推理对抗性agent行为，然后通过Complex Scenario Evolution使用背景车辆放大核心威胁，构建对抗协作图优化关键agent轨迹

Result: 在多个基于强化学习的AV模型上进行的实验显示，ScenGE平均比最先进基线多发现31.96%的严重碰撞案例，且能应用于大模型AV系统，对抗训练可提高模型鲁棒性

Conclusion: 该框架生成的场景既合理又关键，通过真实世界车辆测试和人类评估验证，为建立公众信任和确保安全部署迈出了关键一步

Abstract: The generation of safety-critical scenarios in simulation has become
increasingly crucial for safety evaluation in autonomous vehicles prior to road
deployment in society. However, current approaches largely rely on predefined
threat patterns or rule-based strategies, which limit their ability to expose
diverse and unforeseen failure modes. To overcome these, we propose ScenGE, a
framework that can generate plentiful safety-critical scenarios by reasoning
novel adversarial cases and then amplifying them with complex traffic flows.
Given a simple prompt of a benign scene, it first performs Meta-Scenario
Generation, where a large language model, grounded in structured driving
knowledge, infers an adversarial agent whose behavior poses a threat that is
both plausible and deliberately challenging. This meta-scenario is then
specified in executable code for precise in-simulator control. Subsequently,
Complex Scenario Evolution uses background vehicles to amplify the core threat
introduced by Meta-Scenario. It builds an adversarial collaborator graph to
identify key agent trajectories for optimization. These perturbations are
designed to simultaneously reduce the ego vehicle's maneuvering space and
create critical occlusions. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple
reinforcement learning based AV models show that ScenGE uncovers more severe
collision cases (+31.96%) on average than SoTA baselines. Additionally, our
ScenGE can be applied to large model based AV systems and deployed on different
simulators; we further observe that adversarial training on our scenarios
improves the model robustness. Finally, we validate our framework through
real-world vehicle tests and human evaluation, confirming that the generated
scenarios are both plausible and critical. We hope our paper can build up a
critical step towards building public trust and ensuring their safe deployment.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WISE-FUSE是一个自适应全切片图像编码框架，通过选择性处理诊断相关区域，将WSI编码时间减少三倍以上，同时保持或超越详尽处理的诊断性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全切片图像(WSI)在计算病理学中由于千兆像素规模带来巨大计算挑战，预处理和训练时间长达数天甚至数周，使得WSI编码成为实际部署中最显著的瓶颈。

Method: 利用病理领域视觉语言模型和大型语言模型，通过计算低分辨率补丁与类别特定文本描述的相似性分数，选择信息丰富的区域子集进行选择性编码，并与文本嵌入融合以增强诊断上下文。

Result: 实验表明，WISE-FUSE将WSI编码时间减少了三倍以上，同时实现了与详尽补丁处理相当或更好的诊断性能。

Conclusion: WISE-FUSE为计算病理学提供了一个可扩展且实用的解决方案，通过选择性处理显著降低了计算成本，同时保持了诊断准确性。

Abstract: Whole slide images (WSIs) in computational pathology (CPath) pose a major
computational challenge due to their gigapixel scale, often requiring the
processing of tens to hundreds of thousands of high-resolution patches per
slide. This results in prohibitive encoding costs, with preprocessing and
training times extending to days or even weeks-making WSI encoding the most
significant bottleneck in real-world deployment. In this work, we propose
WISE-FUSE, an adaptive WSI encoding framework that leverages pathology-domain
vision-language models and large language models to address this challenge by
selectively processing diagnostically relevant regions. WISE-FUSE first
computes similarity scores between low-resolution patches and class-specific
textual descriptions using a knowledge distillation mechanism that preserves
fine-grained diagnostic features. Based on these similarity scores, we select a
small subset of informative regions for the target task, which quickly
eliminates irrelevant patches at the coarse level. The corresponding
high-resolution patches are then selectively encoded and fused with textual
embeddings to reinforce diagnostic context. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that WISE-FUSE reduces WSI encoding time by over threefold while achieving
diagnostic performance comparable to or surpassing that of exhaustive patch
processing, offering a scalable and practical solution for CPath.

Motivation: 当前OCR系统在处理低质量文档时表现不佳，特别是印刷文档中域内变异性低但域间变异性高的情况，未能充分利用文档内部的字符形状冗余信息

Method: 使用扩展高斯混合模型(GMM)，通过交替执行期望最大化(EM)算法和簇内重新对齐过程，结合正态性统计测试，利用文档内字符形状的冗余性进行无监督校正

Result: 在多种退化程度的文档上验证有效，包括恢复的乌拉圭军事档案和17世纪至20世纪中期的欧洲报纸，展示了识别效果的改进

Conclusion: 该方法通过利用文档内部冗余信息，能够有效提升低质量文档的OCR识别精度，为历史文档数字化提供了有效的后处理解决方案

Abstract: Current OCR systems are based on deep learning models trained on large
amounts of data. Although they have shown some ability to generalize to unseen
data, especially in detection tasks, they can struggle with recognizing
low-quality data. This is particularly evident for printed documents, where
intra-domain data variability is typically low, but inter-domain data
variability is high. In that context, current OCR methods do not fully exploit
each document's redundancy. We propose an unsupervised method by leveraging the
redundancy of character shapes within a document to correct imperfect outputs
of a given OCR system and suggest better clustering. To this aim, we introduce
an extended Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) by alternating an
Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm with an intra-cluster realignment
process and normality statistical testing. We demonstrate improvements in
documents with various levels of degradation, including recovered Uruguayan
military archives and 17th to mid-20th century European newspapers.

Abstract: Powered by advances in multiple remote sensing sensors, the production of
high spatial resolution images provides great potential to achieve
cost-efficient and high-accuracy agricultural inventory and analysis in an
automated way. Lots of studies that aim at providing an inventory of the level
of each agricultural parcel have generated many methods for Agricultural Parcel
and Boundary Delineation (APBD). This review covers APBD methods for detecting
and delineating agricultural parcels and systematically reviews the past and
present of APBD-related research applied to remote sensing images. With the
goal to provide a clear knowledge map of existing APBD efforts, we conduct a
comprehensive review of recent APBD papers to build a meta-data analysis,
including the algorithm, the study site, the crop type, the sensor type, the
evaluation method, etc. We categorize the methods into three classes: (1)
traditional image processing methods (including pixel-based, edge-based and
region-based); (2) traditional machine learning methods (such as random forest,
decision tree); and (3) deep learning-based methods. With deep
learning-oriented approaches contributing to a majority, we further discuss
deep learning-based methods like semantic segmentation-based, object
detection-based and Transformer-based methods. In addition, we discuss five
APBD-related issues to further comprehend the APBD domain using remote sensing
data, such as multi-sensor data in APBD task, comparisons between single-task
learning and multi-task learning in the APBD domain, comparisons among
different algorithms and different APBD tasks, etc. Finally, this review
proposes some APBD-related applications and a few exciting prospects and
potential hot topics in future APBD research. We hope this review help
researchers who involved in APBD domain to keep track of its development and
tendency.

Motivation: 现有的可控制运动生成方法依赖离散姿态码，无法抓取细集的运动细节，限制了表达力。

Method: 提出使用残差向量量化(RVQ)在姿态码潜在表征基础上补充连续运动特征，保持解释性和可操控性的同时抓取细微运动特征。

Result: 在HumanML3D数据集上，FID从0.041降到0.015，Top-1 R-Precision从0.508提升到0.510，定性分析证实了运动编辑的可控性。

Conclusion: 方法有效解决了离散姿态码在细节表达上的限制，在保持可控性的同时显著提升了运动生成质量。

Abstract: Recent progress in text-to-motion has advanced both 3D human motion
generation and text-based motion control. Controllable motion generation
(CoMo), which enables intuitive control, typically relies on pose code
representations, but discrete pose codes alone cannot capture fine-grained
motion details, limiting expressiveness. To overcome this, we propose a method
that augments pose code-based latent representations with continuous motion
features using residual vector quantization (RVQ). This design preserves the
interpretability and manipulability of pose codes while effectively capturing
subtle motion characteristics such as high-frequency details. Experiments on
the HumanML3D dataset show that our model reduces Frechet inception distance
(FID) from 0.041 to 0.015 and improves Top-1 R-Precision from 0.508 to 0.510.
Qualitative analysis of pairwise direction similarity between pose codes
further confirms the model's controllability for motion editing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的无标签概念瓶颈模型往往无法准确定位概念相关的视觉区域，会关注不相关的区域来预测概念存在，需要改进概念的空间定位能力

Method: 为每个概念分配一个原型，通过原型学习确保原型编码相似局部区域，利用基础模型保证原型与相关概念的相关性，使用原型辅助学习识别每个概念应该预测的正确局部区域

Result: 实验结果表明LCBM能有效识别图像中存在的概念，展现出改进的定位能力，同时保持可比的分类性能

Conclusion: LCBM框架通过原型学习和基础模型的结合，成功解决了概念瓶颈模型中的概念定位问题，实现了更准确的空间概念定位

Abstract: Concept bottleneck models (CBMs) are inherently interpretable models that
make predictions based on human-understandable visual cues, referred to as
concepts. As obtaining dense concept annotations with human labeling is
demanding and costly, recent approaches utilize foundation models to determine
the concepts existing in the images. However, such label-free CBMs often fail
to localize concepts in relevant regions, attending to visually unrelated
regions when predicting concept presence. To this end, we propose a framework,
coined Locality-aware Concept Bottleneck Model (LCBM), which utilizes rich
information from foundation models and adopts prototype learning to ensure
accurate spatial localization of the concepts. Specifically, we assign one
prototype to each concept, promoted to represent a prototypical image feature
of that concept. These prototypes are learned by encouraging them to encode
similar local regions, leveraging foundation models to assure the relevance of
each prototype to its associated concept. Then we use the prototypes to
facilitate the learning process of identifying the proper local region from
which each concept should be predicted. Experimental results demonstrate that
LCBM effectively identifies present concepts in the images and exhibits
improved localization while maintaining comparable classification performance.

TL;DR: GOGS是一个基于2D高斯面元的两阶段框架，通过物理渲染和材料分解解决高光物体逆渲染问题，在几何重建、材料分离和新光照下的照片级重照明方面达到最先进性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法在高光反射下的局限性：基于NeRF的方法计算成本过高，3D高斯泼溅在多视角不一致时产生高频表面噪声和结构伪影，简化渲染方程导致材料属性模糊和不可信的重照明结果

Method: 两阶段框架：1) 通过基于物理的渲染和分割求和近似建立鲁棒表面重建，利用基础模型的几何先验增强；2) 通过蒙特卡洛重要性采样完整渲染方程进行材料分解，使用可微分2D高斯光线追踪建模间接照明，通过基于球面mipmap的方向编码细化高频镜面细节

Conclusion: GOGS框架有效解决了高光物体逆渲染中的多视角不一致和材料属性模糊问题，实现了高质量的几何重建和可信的重照明效果

Abstract: Inverse rendering of glossy objects from RGB imagery remains fundamentally
limited by inherent ambiguity. Although NeRF-based methods achieve
high-fidelity reconstruction via dense-ray sampling, their computational cost
is prohibitive. Recent 3D Gaussian Splatting achieves high reconstruction
efficiency but exhibits limitations under specular reflections. Multi-view
inconsistencies introduce high-frequency surface noise and structural
artifacts, while simplified rendering equations obscure material properties,
leading to implausible relighting results. To address these issues, we propose
GOGS, a novel two-stage framework based on 2D Gaussian surfels. First, we
establish robust surface reconstruction through physics-based rendering with
split-sum approximation, enhanced by geometric priors from foundation models.
Second, we perform material decomposition by leveraging Monte Carlo importance
sampling of the full rendering equation, modeling indirect illumination via
differentiable 2D Gaussian ray tracing and refining high-frequency specular
details through spherical mipmap-based directional encoding that captures
anisotropic highlights. Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art
performance in geometry reconstruction, material separation, and photorealistic
relighting under novel illuminations, outperforming existing inverse rendering
approaches.

Abstract: Whole slide image (WSI) analysis in digital pathology presents unique
challenges due to the gigapixel resolution of WSIs and the scarcity of dense
supervision signals. While Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) is a natural fit
for slide-level tasks, training robust models requires large and diverse
datasets. Even though image augmentation techniques could be utilized to
increase data variability and reduce overfitting, implementing them effectively
is not a trivial task. Traditional patch-level augmentation is prohibitively
expensive due to the large number of patches extracted from each WSI, and
existing feature-level augmentation methods lack control over transformation
semantics. We introduce HistAug, a fast and efficient generative model for
controllable augmentations in the latent space for digital pathology. By
conditioning on explicit patch-level transformations (e.g., hue, erosion),
HistAug generates realistic augmented embeddings while preserving initial
semantic information. Our method allows the processing of a large number of
patches in a single forward pass efficiently, while at the same time
consistently improving MIL model performance. Experiments across multiple
slide-level tasks and diverse organs show that HistAug outperforms existing
methods, particularly in low-data regimes. Ablation studies confirm the
benefits of learned transformations over noise-based perturbations and
highlight the importance of uniform WSI-wise augmentation. Code is available at

develop social relations and build community; 3) More importantly, how
intelligent robots and humans can co-exist in an open world. To support these,
Virtual Community features: 1) An open-source multi-agent physics simulator
that supports robots, humans, and their interactions within a society; 2) A
large-scale, real-world aligned community generation pipeline, including vast
outdoor space, diverse indoor scenes, and a community of grounded agents with
rich characters and appearances. Leveraging Virtual Community, we propose two
novel challenges. The Community Planning Challenge evaluates multi-agent
reasoning and planning ability in open-world settings, such as cooperating to
help agents with daily activities and efficiently connecting other agents. The
Community Robot Challenge requires multiple heterogeneous robots to collaborate
in solving complex open-world tasks. We evaluate various baselines on these
tasks and demonstrate the challenges in both high-level open-world task
planning and low-level cooperation controls. We hope that Virtual Community
will unlock further study of human-robot coexistence within open-world
environments.

Abstract: Fire outbreaks pose critical threats to human life and infrastructure,
necessitating high-fidelity early-warning systems that detect combustion
precursors such as smoke. However, smoke plumes exhibit complex spatiotemporal
dynamics influenced by illumination variability, flow kinematics, and
environmental noise, undermining the reliability of traditional detectors. To
address these challenges without the logistical complexity of multi-sensor
arrays, we propose an information-fusion framework by integrating smoke feature
representations extracted from monocular imagery. Specifically, a Two-Phase
Uncertainty-Aware Shifted Windows Transformer for robust and reliable smoke
detection, leveraging a novel smoke segmentation dataset, constructed via
optical flow-based motion encoding, is proposed. The optical flow estimation is
performed with a four-color-theorem-inspired dual-phase level-set
fractional-order variational model, which preserves motion discontinuities. The
resulting color-encoded optical flow maps are fused with appearance cues via a
Gaussian Mixture Model to generate binary segmentation masks of the smoke
regions. These fused representations are fed into the novel Shifted-Windows
Transformer, which is augmented with a multi-scale uncertainty estimation head
and trained under a two-phase learning regimen. First learning phase optimizes
smoke detection accuracy, while during the second phase, the model learns to
estimate plausibility confidence in its predictions by jointly modeling
aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties. Extensive experiments using multiple
evaluation metrics and comparative analysis with state-of-the-art approaches
demonstrate superior generalization and robustness, offering a reliable
solution for early fire detection in surveillance, industrial safety, and
autonomous monitoring applications.

Abstract: Visual prompt-based methods have seen growing interest in incremental
learning (IL) for image classification. These approaches learn additional
embedding vectors while keeping the model frozen, making them efficient to
train. However, no prior work has applied such methods to incremental object
detection (IOD), leaving their generalizability unclear. In this paper, we
analyze three different prompt-based methods under a complex domain-incremental
learning setting. We additionally provide a wide range of reference baselines
for comparison. Empirically, we show that the prompt-based approaches we tested
underperform in this setting. However, a strong yet practical method, combining
visual prompts with replaying a small portion of previous data, achieves the
best results. Together with additional experiments on prompt length and
initialization, our findings offer valuable insights for advancing prompt-based
IL in IOD.

Method: 提出统一时空状态空间模型(UST-SSM)，包含时空选择扫描(STSS)重组无序点为语义感知序列，时空结构聚合(STSA)补偿几何和运动细节，时间交互采样(TIS)增强时序依赖

Result: 在MSR-Action3D、NTU RGB+D和Synthia 4D数据集上验证了方法的有效性

Conclusion: UST-SSM成功解决了点云视频的时空无序问题，扩展了状态空间模型在点云视频分析中的应用

Abstract: Point cloud videos capture dynamic 3D motion while reducing the effects of
lighting and viewpoint variations, making them highly effective for recognizing
subtle and continuous human actions. Although Selective State Space Models
(SSMs) have shown good performance in sequence modeling with linear complexity,
the spatio-temporal disorder of point cloud videos hinders their unidirectional
modeling when directly unfolding the point cloud video into a 1D sequence
through temporally sequential scanning. To address this challenge, we propose
the Unified Spatio-Temporal State Space Model (UST-SSM), which extends the
latest advancements in SSMs to point cloud videos. Specifically, we introduce
Spatial-Temporal Selection Scanning (STSS), which reorganizes unordered points
into semantic-aware sequences through prompt-guided clustering, thereby
enabling the effective utilization of points that are spatially and temporally
distant yet similar within the sequence. For missing 4D geometric and motion
details, Spatio-Temporal Structure Aggregation (STSA) aggregates
spatio-temporal features and compensates. To improve temporal interaction
within the sampled sequence, Temporal Interaction Sampling (TIS) enhances
fine-grained temporal dependencies through non-anchor frame utilization and
expanded receptive fields. Experimental results on the MSR-Action3D, NTU RGB+D,
and Synthia 4D datasets validate the effectiveness of our method. Our code is
available at https://github.com/wangzy01/UST-SSM.

*Pengzhi Zhong,Xinzhe Wang,Dan Zeng,Qihua Zhou,Feixiang He,Shuiwang Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SMTrack是首个直接在标准RGB视频上进行端到端多目标跟踪的深度脉冲神经网络框架，通过自适应尺度感知的归一化Wasserstein距离损失和TrackTrack身份模块，在复杂场景中实现了与领先ANN方法相当的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然脉冲神经网络(SNN)在低功耗计算方面具有巨大潜力，但其在视觉任务中的应用主要局限于图像分类、目标检测和事件跟踪。对于真实世界中广泛使用的RGB视频流，SNN在复杂时序任务如多目标跟踪(MOT)中的潜力尚未充分探索。

Method: 提出SMTrack框架，包含：1) Asa-NWDLoss损失函数，根据训练批次中的平均目标大小动态调整归一化因子，提升对小目标的检测和定位敏感度；2) TrackTrack身份模块，在关联阶段保持目标轨迹的鲁棒性和一致性。

Result: 在BEE24、MOT17、MOT20和DanceTrack数据集上的广泛评估表明，SMTrack实现了与领先的基于ANN的MOT方法相当的性能。

Conclusion: SMTrack推动了SNN在复杂场景中实现鲁棒准确的跟踪能力，为脉冲神经网络在真实世界视觉任务中的应用开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Brain-inspired Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) exhibit significant potential
for low-power computation, yet their application in visual tasks remains
largely confined to image classification, object detection, and event-based
tracking. In contrast, real-world vision systems still widely use conventional
RGB video streams, where the potential of directly-trained SNNs for complex
temporal tasks such as multi-object tracking (MOT) remains underexplored. To
address this challenge, we propose SMTrack-the first directly trained deep SNN
framework for end-to-end multi-object tracking on standard RGB videos. SMTrack
introduces an adaptive and scale-aware Normalized Wasserstein Distance loss
(Asa-NWDLoss) to improve detection and localization performance under varying
object scales and densities. Specifically, the method computes the average
object size within each training batch and dynamically adjusts the
normalization factor, thereby enhancing sensitivity to small objects. For the
association stage, we incorporate the TrackTrack identity module to maintain
robust and consistent object trajectories. Extensive evaluations on BEE24,
MOT17, MOT20, and DanceTrack show that SMTrack achieves performance on par with
leading ANN-based MOT methods, advancing robust and accurate SNN-based tracking
in complex scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在处理分钟级长视频时存在结构漂移和时间伪影的问题，需要保持数千帧的全局一致性和时间连贯性

Method: 采用渐进去噪过程强制结构一致性，通过多模态指导保持时间动态，将任务解耦为稀疏锚点帧编辑和平滑中间帧插值

Conclusion: AnchorSync通过创新的解耦框架有效解决了长视频编辑中的一致性和连贯性挑战，为高质量长视频编辑提供了可行解决方案

Abstract: Editing long videos remains a challenging task due to the need for
maintaining both global consistency and temporal coherence across thousands of
frames. Existing methods often suffer from structural drift or temporal
artifacts, particularly in minute-long sequences. We introduce AnchorSync, a
novel diffusion-based framework that enables high-quality, long-term video
editing by decoupling the task into sparse anchor frame editing and smooth
intermediate frame interpolation. Our approach enforces structural consistency
through a progressive denoising process and preserves temporal dynamics via
multimodal guidance. Extensive experiments show that AnchorSync produces
coherent, high-fidelity edits, surpassing prior methods in visual quality and
temporal stability.

Abstract: Segmentation in dense visual scenes poses significant challenges due to
occlusions, background clutter, and scale variations. To address this, we
introduce PerSense, an end-to-end, training-free, and model-agnostic one-shot
framework for Personalized instance Segmentation in dense images. PerSense
employs a novel Instance Detection Module (IDM) that leverages density maps
(DMs) to generate instance-level candidate point prompts, followed by a Point
Prompt Selection Module (PPSM) that filters false positives via adaptive
thresholding and spatial gating. A feedback mechanism further enhances
segmentation by automatically selecting effective exemplars to improve DM
quality. We additionally present PerSense++, an enhanced variant that
incorporates three additional components to improve robustness in cluttered
scenes: (i) a diversity-aware exemplar selection strategy that leverages
feature and scale diversity for better DM generation; (ii) a hybrid IDM
combining contour and peak-based prompt generation for improved instance
separation within complex density patterns; and (iii) an Irrelevant Mask
Rejection Module (IMRM) that discards spatially inconsistent masks using
outlier analysis. Finally, to support this underexplored task, we introduce
PerSense-D, a dedicated benchmark for personalized segmentation in dense
images. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that
PerSense++ outperforms existing methods in dense settings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GeMS是一个处理严重运动模糊图像的3D高斯泼溅框架，无需依赖清晰图像进行相机姿态估计和点云生成，通过深度学习SfM和概率分布采样实现直接重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常假设能够获得清晰图像进行相机姿态估计和点云生成，这在严重运动模糊情况下是不现实的。基于COLMAP初始化的方法也会因特征对应不可靠而失败。

Method: 1) VGGSfM：基于深度学习的SfM管道，直接从模糊输入估计姿态和生成点云；2) 3DGS-MCMC：将高斯视为概率分布样本，消除启发式密集化和修剪；3) 相机轨迹和高斯参数联合优化；4) GeMS-E增加事件驱动的渐进细化步骤。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上实现了最先进的性能，是首个直接从严重模糊输入处理极端运动模糊的3DGS框架。

Conclusion: GeMS框架成功解决了从极端运动模糊图像直接进行3D重建的挑战，通过深度学习SfM和概率方法实现了可靠的场景重建，事件数据的集成进一步提升了重建质量。

Abstract: We introduce GeMS, a framework for 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) designed to
handle severely motion-blurred images. State-of-the-art deblurring methods for
extreme blur, such as ExBluRF, as well as Gaussian Splatting-based approaches
like Deblur-GS, typically assume access to sharp images for camera pose
estimation and point cloud generation, an unrealistic assumption. Methods
relying on COLMAP initialization, such as BAD-Gaussians, also fail due to
unreliable feature correspondences under severe blur. To address these
challenges, we propose GeMS, a 3DGS framework that reconstructs scenes directly
from extremely blurred images. GeMS integrates: (1) VGGSfM, a deep
learning-based Structure-from-Motion pipeline that estimates poses and
generates point clouds directly from blurred inputs; (2) 3DGS-MCMC, which
enables robust scene initialization by treating Gaussians as samples from a
probability distribution, eliminating heuristic densification and pruning; and
(3) joint optimization of camera trajectories and Gaussian parameters for
stable reconstruction. While this pipeline produces strong results,
inaccuracies may remain when all inputs are severely blurred. To mitigate this,
we propose GeMS-E, which integrates a progressive refinement step using events:
(4) Event-based Double Integral (EDI) deblurring restores sharper images that
are then fed into GeMS, improving pose estimation, point cloud generation, and
overall reconstruction. Both GeMS and GeMS-E achieve state-of-the-art
performance on synthetic and real-world datasets. To our knowledge, this is the
first framework to address extreme motion blur within 3DGS directly from
severely blurred inputs.

*Jiabo Huang,Chen Chen,Lingjuan Lyu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 通过聚合多个预训练的基础模型知识，提出一种无需大规模标签数据的视觉基础模型构建方法，解决了数据中心方法的数据瓶颈问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决数据中心方法对大规模高质量标签数据和高端GPU的依赖问题，利用现有预训练模型的知识涵盛以构建通用视觉基础模型

Method: 统一多个预训练教师模型在共享潜在空间中，通过知识保持策略和adapter模块集成专门领域教师的知识

Result: 构建的VFM在四个基础视觉任务（图像分类、目标检测、语义分割、实例分割）上都超过现有数据中心模型

Conclusion: 模型驱动方法能够有效继承现有模型的专业知识，提供了一种替代数据中心方法的通用视觉基础模型构建方案

Abstract: Vision foundation models (VFMs) are predominantly developed using
data-centric methods. These methods require training on vast amounts of data
usually with high-quality labels, which poses a bottleneck for most
institutions that lack both large-scale data and high-end GPUs. On the other
hand, many open-source vision models have been pretrained on domain-specific
data, enabling them to distill and represent core knowledge in a form that is
transferable across diverse applications. Even though these models are highly
valuable assets, they remain largely under-explored in empowering the
development of a general-purpose VFM. In this paper, we presents a new
model-driven approach for training VFMs through joint knowledge transfer and
preservation. Our method unifies multiple pre-trained teacher models in a
shared latent space to mitigate the ``imbalanced transfer'' issue caused by
their distributional gaps. Besides, we introduce a knowledge preservation
strategy to take a general-purpose teacher as a knowledge base for integrating
knowledge from the remaining purpose-specific teachers using an adapter module.
By unifying and aggregating existing models, we build a powerful VFM to inherit
teachers' expertise without needing to train on a large amount of labeled data.
Our model not only provides generalizable visual features, but also inherently
supports multiple downstream tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
VFM outperforms existing data-centric models across four fundamental vision
tasks, including image classification, object detection, semantic and instance
segmentation.

TL;DR: GSFix3D是一个新框架，通过将扩散模型的先验知识蒸馏到3D表示中，改善3D高斯泼溅在极端视角和部分观察区域的渲染质量，实现鲁棒的新视角修复。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D高斯泼溅在新视角合成方面有显著进展，但在极端视角或部分观察区域生成高质量渲染仍具挑战性；扩散模型具有强大的生成能力，但对文本提示的依赖和缺乏特定场景信息限制了其在3D重建任务中的准确性。

Method: 提出GSFix3D框架，核心是GSFixer（通过定制微调协议获得的潜在扩散模型），能够利用网格和3D高斯将预训练生成模型适应不同环境和重建方法的伪影类型；提出随机掩码增强策略，使GSFixer能够合理修复缺失区域。

Result: 在具有挑战性的基准测试中达到最先进性能，仅需对捕获数据进行最少的场景特定微调；真实世界测试进一步证实其对潜在姿态误差的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: GSFix3D成功解决了3D高斯泼溅在约束不足区域的视觉保真度问题，通过扩散模型先验知识蒸馏实现了高质量的新视角修复，具有很好的泛化能力和实用性。

Abstract: Recent developments in 3D Gaussian Splatting have significantly enhanced
novel view synthesis, yet generating high-quality renderings from extreme novel
viewpoints or partially observed regions remains challenging. Meanwhile,
diffusion models exhibit strong generative capabilities, but their reliance on
text prompts and lack of awareness of specific scene information hinder
accurate 3D reconstruction tasks. To address these limitations, we introduce
GSFix3D, a novel framework that improves the visual fidelity in
under-constrained regions by distilling prior knowledge from diffusion models
into 3D representations, while preserving consistency with observed scene
details. At its core is GSFixer, a latent diffusion model obtained via our
customized fine-tuning protocol that can leverage both mesh and 3D Gaussians to
adapt pretrained generative models to a variety of environments and artifact
types from different reconstruction methods, enabling robust novel view repair
for unseen camera poses. Moreover, we propose a random mask augmentation
strategy that empowers GSFixer to plausibly inpaint missing regions.
Experiments on challenging benchmarks demonstrate that our GSFix3D and GSFixer
achieve state-of-the-art performance, requiring only minimal scene-specific
fine-tuning on captured data. Real-world test further confirms its resilience
to potential pose errors. Our code and data will be made publicly available.

Abstract: Ensuring safety in autonomous driving is a complex challenge requiring
handling unknown objects and unforeseen driving scenarios. We develop
multiscale video transformers capable of detecting unknown objects using only
motion cues. Video semantic and panoptic segmentation often relies on known
classes seen during training, overlooking novel categories. Recent visual
grounding with large language models is computationally expensive, especially
for pixel-level output. We propose an efficient video transformer trained
end-to-end for class-agnostic segmentation without optical flow. Our method
uses multi-stage multiscale query-memory decoding and a scale-specific random
drop-token to ensure efficiency and accuracy, maintaining detailed
spatiotemporal features with a shared, learnable memory module. Unlike
conventional decoders that compress features, our memory-centric design
preserves high-resolution information at multiple scales. We evaluate on
DAVIS'16, KITTI, and Cityscapes. Our method consistently outperforms multiscale
baselines while being efficient in GPU memory and run-time, demonstrating a
promising direction for real-time, robust dense prediction in safety-critical
robotics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RAW图像具有传感器和光照特定的特性，这使得为深度学习捕获RAW数据集具有挑战性，因为需要为每个传感器和广泛的光照条件捕获场景。需要开发光照增强和传感器间映射的方法来减轻数据采集负担。

Method: 使用定制化的可调光谱光照箱捕获多个场景，构建包含390种光照、4个相机和18个场景的数据集。提出轻量级神经网络方法进行光照和传感器映射。

Result: 提出的方法在竞争中表现优异，并在神经ISP训练等下游任务中展示了实用性。

Conclusion: 该研究为解决RAW图像处理中的光照和传感器依赖问题提供了有效的数据集和方法，显著降低了深度学习应用中的数据采集需求。

Abstract: RAW images are unprocessed camera sensor output with sensor-specific RGB
values based on the sensor's color filter spectral sensitivities. RAW images
also incur strong color casts due to the sensor's response to the spectral
properties of scene illumination. The sensor- and illumination-specific nature
of RAW images makes it challenging to capture RAW datasets for deep learning
methods, as scenes need to be captured for each sensor and under a wide range
of illumination. Methods for illumination augmentation for a given sensor and
the ability to map RAW images between sensors are important for reducing the
burden of data capture. To explore this problem, we introduce the
first-of-its-kind dataset comprising carefully captured scenes under a wide
range of illumination. Specifically, we use a customized lightbox with tunable
illumination spectra to capture several scenes with different cameras. Our
illumination and sensor mapping dataset has 390 illuminations, four cameras,
and 18 scenes. Using this dataset, we introduce a lightweight neural network
approach for illumination and sensor mapping that outperforms competing
methods. We demonstrate the utility of our approach on the downstream task of
training a neural ISP. Link to project page:

TL;DR: 通过融合单目RGB图像和AIS数据，提出了一种创建海上船舶6D始体位估计数据集的新技术，解决了依靠单纯AIS数据的限制问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统AIS系统存在设备可靠性、数据操控和传输延迟等问题，导致位置信息不准确。需要一种新的方法来创建不需手动标注的6D始体位估计数据集。

Method: 使用YOLOX-X对象检测网络从单目RGB图像中检测船舶，然后融合AIS消息生成3D边框来表示船舶的6D位置。比较了两种变换方法（同胚和PnP）来对齐AIS数据与图像坐标。

Result: PnP方法比同胚方法较低投影误差，YOLOX-X模型在IoU阈值0.5时达到0.80的mAP。创建了包含3753张图像的BONK-pose公开数据集，以及1000张船舶检测图像。

Conclusion: 该技术能够在不需手动标注的情况下创建高质量的6D始体位估计数据集，为海上船舶位置估计领域提供了重要的数据支持。

Abstract: The paper presents a novel technique for creating a 6D pose estimation
dataset for marine vessels by fusing monocular RGB images with Automatic
Identification System (AIS) data. The proposed technique addresses the
limitations of relying purely on AIS for location information, caused by issues
like equipment reliability, data manipulation, and transmission delays. By
combining vessel detections from monocular RGB images, obtained using an object
detection network (YOLOX-X), with AIS messages, the technique generates 3D
bounding boxes that represent the vessels' 6D poses, i.e. spatial and
rotational dimensions. The paper evaluates different object detection models to
locate vessels in image space. We also compare two transformation methods
(homography and Perspective-n-Point) for aligning AIS data with image
coordinates. The results of our work demonstrate that the Perspective-n-Point
(PnP) method achieves a significantly lower projection error compared to
homography-based approaches used before, and the YOLOX-X model achieves a mean
Average Precision (mAP) of 0.80 at an Intersection over Union (IoU) threshold
of 0.5 for relevant vessel classes. We show indication that our approach allows
the creation of a 6D pose estimation dataset without needing manual annotation.
Additionally, we introduce the Boats on Nordelbe Kehrwieder (BONK-pose), a
publicly available dataset comprising 3753 images with 3D bounding box
annotations for pose estimation, created by our data fusion approach. This
dataset can be used for training and evaluating 6D pose estimation networks. In
addition we introduce a set of 1000 images with 2D bounding box annotations for
ship detection from the same scene.

Motivation: 解决高速运动物体位姿跟踪问题，反应传统RGB相机帧率限制和运动模糊的挑战，利用事件相机高时间分辨率优势

Method: 结合事件相机光流算法和RGB全局位姿估计器，通过光流测量物体运动实现6-DoF速度跟踪，与低频位姿估计集成

Result: 在合成和实际数据上验证有效性，特别在高速运动场景中表现优异

Conclusion: 方法有效结合了事件相机和RGB相机的优势，成功解决了高速运动物体6-DoF位姿跟踪挑战

Abstract: Tracking the position and orientation of objects in space (i.e., in 6-DoF) in
real time is a fundamental problem in robotics for environment interaction. It
becomes more challenging when objects move at high-speed due to frame rate
limitations in conventional cameras and motion blur. Event cameras are
characterized by high temporal resolution, low latency and high dynamic range,
that can potentially overcome the impacts of motion blur. Traditional RGB
cameras provide rich visual information that is more suitable for the
challenging task of single-shot object pose estimation. In this work, we
propose using event-based optical flow combined with an RGB based global object
pose estimator for 6-DoF pose tracking of objects at high-speed, exploiting the
core advantages of both types of vision sensors. Specifically, we propose an
event-based optical flow algorithm for object motion measurement to implement
an object 6-DoF velocity tracker. By integrating the tracked object 6-DoF
velocity with low frequency estimated pose from the global pose estimator, the
method can track pose when objects move at high-speed. The proposed algorithm
is tested and validated on both synthetic and real world data, demonstrating
its effectiveness, especially in high-speed motion scenarios.

Abstract: Pathology foundation models (PFMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential in
whole-slide image (WSI) diagnosis. However, pathology images from different
hospitals often vary due to differences in scanning hardware and preprocessing
styles, which may lead PFMs to inadvertently learn hospital-specific features,
posing risks for clinical deployment. In this work, we present the first
systematic study of domain bias in PFMs arising from hospital source
characteristics. Specifically, we (1) construct a pipeline for quantifying
domain bias in PFMs, (2) evaluate and compare the performance of multiple
models, and (3) propose a lightweight adversarial framework that removes latent
hospital-specific features from frozen representations without modifying the
encoder itself. By introducing a trainable adapter and a domain classifier
connected through a gradient reversal layer (GRL), our method learns
task-discriminative yet domain-invariant representations. Experiments on
multi-center histopathology datasets demonstrate that our approach
substantially reduces domain predictability while maintaining or even improving
disease classification performance, particularly in out-of-domain (unseen
hospital) scenarios. Further analyses, including hospital detection and feature
space visualization, confirm the effectiveness of our method in mitigating
hospital bias. We will provide our code based on acceptance.

Abstract: License plate recognition (LPR) is important for traffic law enforcement,
crime investigation, and surveillance. However, license plate areas in dash cam
images often suffer from low resolution, motion blur, and glare, which make
accurate recognition challenging. Existing generative models that rely on
pretrained priors cannot reliably restore such poor-quality images, frequently
introducing severe artifacts and distortions. To address this issue, we propose
a novel multi-frame license plate restoration and recognition framework,
MF-LPR$^2$, which addresses ambiguities in poor-quality images by aligning and
aggregating neighboring frames instead of relying on pretrained knowledge. To
achieve accurate frame alignment, we employ a state-of-the-art optical flow
estimator in conjunction with carefully designed algorithms that detect and
correct erroneous optical flow estimations by leveraging the spatio-temporal
consistency inherent in license plate image sequences. Our approach enhances
both image quality and recognition accuracy while preserving the evidential
content of the input images. In addition, we constructed a novel Realistic LPR
(RLPR) dataset to evaluate MF-LPR$^2$. The RLPR dataset contains 200 pairs of
low-quality license plate image sequences and high-quality pseudo ground-truth
images, reflecting the complexities of real-world scenarios. In experiments,
MF-LPR$^2$ outperformed eight recent restoration models in terms of PSNR, SSIM,
and LPIPS by significant margins. In recognition, MF-LPR$^2$ achieved an
accuracy of 86.44%, outperforming both the best single-frame LPR (14.04%) and
the multi-frame LPR (82.55%) among the eleven baseline models. The results of
ablation studies confirm that our filtering and refinement algorithms
significantly contribute to these improvements.

*Shansong Wang,Mojtaba Safari,Mingzhe Hu,Qiang Li,Chih-Wei Chang,Richard LJ Qiu,Xiaofeng Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出无需训练的医学图像配准方法，使用冻结的DINOv3编码器和测试时特征空间形变场优化，在两个基准测试中取得优异性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统学习方法需要大量训练数据的问题，推动医学图像配准在临床中的实际应用

Method: 使用预训练的DINOv3编码器提取特征，在测试时通过优化特征空间中的形变场来实现图像配准，无需额外训练

Result: 在腹部MR-CT配准中达到最佳Dice分数0.790，最低HD95距离4.9±5.0，最低SDLogJ 0.08±0.02；在心脏MRI配准中DSC提升至0.769，SDLogJ降至0.11，HD95降至4.8

Conclusion: 在紧凑的基础特征空间中进行测试时优化，为无需额外训练的临床图像配准提供了实用且通用的解决方案

Abstract: Prior medical image registration approaches, particularly learning-based
methods, often require large amounts of training data, which constrains
clinical adoption. To overcome this limitation, we propose a training-free
pipeline that relies on a frozen DINOv3 encoder and test-time optimization of
the deformation field in feature space. Across two representative benchmarks,
the method is accurate and yields regular deformations. On Abdomen MR-CT, it
attained the best mean Dice score (DSC) of 0.790 together with the lowest 95th
percentile Hausdorff Distance (HD95) of 4.9+-5.0 and the lowest standard
deviation of Log-Jacobian (SDLogJ) of 0.08+-0.02. On ACDC cardiac MRI, it
improves mean DSC to 0.769 and reduces SDLogJ to 0.11 and HD95 to 4.8, a marked
gain over the initial alignment. The results indicate that operating in a
compact foundation feature space at test time offers a practical and general
solution for clinical registration without additional training.

*Canyu Zhao,Xiaoman Li,Tianjian Feng,Zhiyue Zhao,Hao Chen,Chunhua Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Tinker是一个无需逐场景微调的高保真3D编辑框架，支持单样本和少样本编辑，通过重新利用预训练扩散模型实现多视角一致性编辑


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有技术需要大量逐场景优化来确保多视角一致性，Tinker旨在降低通用3D内容创建的门槛，实现真正可扩展的零样本3D编辑

Method: 包含两个核心组件：(1)参考多视角编辑器实现精确的参考驱动编辑；(2)任意视角到视频合成器利用视频扩散的空间-时间先验进行高质量场景补全和新视角生成

Result: 在编辑、新视角合成和渲染增强任务上达到最先进性能，显著减少了通用3D内容创建的障碍

Conclusion: Tinker代表了向真正可扩展的零样本3D编辑迈出的关键一步，无需逐场景训练即可生成多视角一致的编辑视图

Abstract: We introduce Tinker, a versatile framework for high-fidelity 3D editing that
operates in both one-shot and few-shot regimes without any per-scene
finetuning. Unlike prior techniques that demand extensive per-scene
optimization to ensure multi-view consistency or to produce dozens of
consistent edited input views, Tinker delivers robust, multi-view consistent
edits from as few as one or two images. This capability stems from repurposing
pretrained diffusion models, which unlocks their latent 3D awareness. To drive
research in this space, we curate the first large-scale multi-view editing
dataset and data pipeline, spanning diverse scenes and styles. Building on this
dataset, we develop our framework capable of generating multi-view consistent
edited views without per-scene training, which consists of two novel
components: (1) Referring multi-view editor: Enables precise, reference-driven
edits that remain coherent across all viewpoints. (2) Any-view-to-video
synthesizer: Leverages spatial-temporal priors from video diffusion to perform
high-quality scene completion and novel-view generation even from sparse
inputs. Through extensive experiments, Tinker significantly reduces the barrier
to generalizable 3D content creation, achieving state-of-the-art performance on
editing, novel-view synthesis, and rendering enhancement tasks. We believe that
Tinker represents a key step towards truly scalable, zero-shot 3D editing.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的视频-文本检索框架，通过细粒度特征学习和推理管道改进，在不增加训练成本的情况下提升检索性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频流媒体爆炸式增长带来高精度和低训练成本的挑战，现有方法依赖大规模预训练导致计算需求大，且视频和文本的细粒度信息未被充分探索

Method: 采用粗到细的目标函数理解视频-文本对的语义信息，包括对比学习和匹配学习；通过粒度感知表示模块获取细粒度训练数据；提出包含投票机制和匹配熵度量的推理管道

Result: 在四个基准测试中优于先前方法，推理管道在MSR-VTT数据集上Recall@1提升2.1%，在DiDeMo数据集上提升1.6%

Conclusion: 该方法通过细粒度特征学习和创新的推理管道，有效提升了视频-文本检索性能，且无需额外预训练成本

Abstract: The explosive growth of video streaming presents challenges in achieving high
accuracy and low training costs for video-language retrieval. However, existing
methods rely on large-scale pre-training to improve video retrieval
performance, resulting in significant computational demands. Additionally, the
fine-grained information in videos and texts remains underexplored. To
alleviate these problems, we propose a novel framework to learn fine-grained
features for better alignment and introduce an inference pipeline to improve
performance without additional training. Specifically, we employ coarse-to-fine
objectives to understand the semantic information of video-text pairs,
including contrastive and matching learning. The fine-grained data used for
training is obtained through the Granularity-Aware Representation module, which
is designed based on similarity analysis between video frames and words in
captions. Furthermore, we observe that the repetition of keywords in the
original captions, referred to as "Repetition", can enhance retrieval
performance and improve alignment between video and text. Based on this
insight, we propose a novel and effective inference pipeline that incorporates
a voting mechanism and a new Matching Entropy metric to achieve better
retrieval performance without requiring additional pre-training. Experimental
results on four benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms
previous approaches. Additionally, our inference pipeline achieves significant
performance improvements, with a 2.1% increase in Recall@1 on the MSR-VTT
dataset and a 1.6% increase on the DiDeMo dataset.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TransLight是一个新颖的光照效果迁移框架，通过生成式解耦技术准确分离图像内容和光照效果，实现了跨图像的高保真、高自由度光照迁移。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有光照编辑方法无法同时提供定制化光照控制并保持内容完整性，特别是在将复杂光照效果从参考图像迁移到目标图像时效果不佳。

Method: 使用两个微调的扩散模型进行生成式解耦，分离图像内容和光照效果，构建百万级图像-内容-光照三元组数据集，然后基于IC-Light生成模型训练，将参考光照图像作为额外条件信号。

Result: TransLight成功实现了跨不同图像的光照效果迁移，提供了比现有技术更定制化的光照控制，在光照协调和编辑方面开辟了新方向。

Conclusion: 通过彻底解耦参考图像中的光照效果，TransLight实现了高度灵活的光照控制，成为首个成功跨图像迁移光照效果的方法。

Abstract: Most existing illumination-editing approaches fail to simultaneously provide
customized control of light effects and preserve content integrity. This makes
them less effective for practical lighting stylization requirements, especially
in the challenging task of transferring complex light effects from a reference
image to a user-specified target image. To address this problem, we propose
TransLight, a novel framework that enables high-fidelity and high-freedom
transfer of light effects. Extracting the light effect from the reference image
is the most critical and challenging step in our method. The difficulty lies in
the complex geometric structure features embedded in light effects that are
highly coupled with content in real-world scenarios. To achieve this, we first
present Generative Decoupling, where two fine-tuned diffusion models are used
to accurately separate image content and light effects, generating a newly
curated, million-scale dataset of image-content-light triplets. Then, we employ
IC-Light as the generative model and train our model with our triplets,
injecting the reference lighting image as an additional conditioning signal.
The resulting TransLight model enables customized and natural transfer of
diverse light effects. Notably, by thoroughly disentangling light effects from
reference images, our generative decoupling strategy endows TransLight with
highly flexible illumination control. Experimental results establish TransLight
as the first method to successfully transfer light effects across disparate
images, delivering more customized illumination control than existing
techniques and charting new directions for research in illumination
harmonization and editing.

TL;DR: EventSSEG是一种基于事件相机的道路分割方法，通过事件计算和概率注意力机制实现低延迟、低功耗的道路分割，无需大量标注数据


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统帧相机在自动驾驶道路分割中存在延迟高、计算量大的问题，事件相机提供了低功耗感知的替代方案，但缺乏标注数据限制了其应用

Method: 使用事件计算和概率注意力机制，采用基于事件的自监督学习方法，避免从传统相机域迁移预训练权重的问题

Result: 在DSEC-Semantic和DDD17数据集上实现了最先进的性能，仅需少量标注事件数据

Conclusion: 该方法充分利用了事件相机的优势，有效解决了标注数据稀缺的问题，为自动驾驶道路分割提供了高效解决方案

Abstract: Road segmentation is pivotal for autonomous vehicles, yet achieving low
latency and low compute solutions using frame based cameras remains a
challenge. Event cameras offer a promising alternative. To leverage their low
power sensing, we introduce EventSSEG, a method for road segmentation that uses
event only computing and a probabilistic attention mechanism. Event only
computing poses a challenge in transferring pretrained weights from the
conventional camera domain, requiring abundant labeled data, which is scarce.
To overcome this, EventSSEG employs event-based self supervised learning,
eliminating the need for extensive labeled data. Experiments on DSEC-Semantic
and DDD17 show that EventSSEG achieves state of the art performance with
minimal labeled events. This approach maximizes event cameras capabilities and
addresses the lack of labeled events.

Motivation: 理解脾臀的正常老化趋势对于检测2型糖尿病和其他脾臀疾病的异常变化至关重要

Method: 分析2533名患者的腹部CT或MRI图像，采用自动化方法分割脾臀并提取13个形态特征，使用GAMLSS回归模型分析脾臀形态趋势

Result: 在调整混杂因素后，13个形态特征中有10个在2型糖尿病患者中显示出显著不同的老化趋势，脾臀在糖尿病患者中更小

Conclusion: 研究提供了脾臀在生命周期中的形态变化参考，证实2型糖尿病导致脾臀缩小，为临床诊断提供了重要依据

Abstract: Purpose: Understanding how the pancreas changes is critical for detecting
deviations in type 2 diabetes and other pancreatic disease. We measure pancreas
size and shape using morphological measurements from ages 0 to 90. Our goals
are to 1) identify reliable clinical imaging modalities for AI-based pancreas
measurement, 2) establish normative morphological aging trends, and 3) detect
potential deviations in type 2 diabetes.
  Approach: We analyzed a clinically acquired dataset of 2533 patients imaged
with abdominal CT or MRI. We resampled the scans to 3mm isotropic resolution,
segmented the pancreas using automated methods, and extracted 13 morphological
pancreas features across the lifespan. First, we assessed CT and MRI
measurements to determine which modalities provide consistent lifespan trends.
Second, we characterized distributions of normative morphological patterns
stratified by age group and sex. Third, we used GAMLSS regression to model
pancreas morphology trends in 1350 patients matched for age, sex, and type 2
diabetes status to identify any deviations from normative aging associated with
type 2 diabetes.
  Results: When adjusting for confounders, the aging trends for 10 of 13
morphological features were significantly different between patients with type
2 diabetes and non-diabetic controls (p < 0.05 after multiple comparisons
corrections). Additionally, MRI appeared to yield different pancreas
measurements than CT using our AI-based method.
  Conclusions: We provide lifespan trends demonstrating that the size and shape
of the pancreas is altered in type 2 diabetes using 675 control patients and
675 diabetes patients. Moreover, our findings reinforce that the pancreas is
smaller in type 2 diabetes. Additionally, we contribute a reference of lifespan
pancreas morphology from a large cohort of non-diabetic control patients in a
clinical setting.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出多骨架对比学习框架MS-CLR，通过跨不同骨架结构的对比学习提升动作识别的泛化能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对比学习方法局限于单一骨架结构，无法有效处理具有不同关节结构和解剖覆盖范围的多样化数据集

Method: 提出MS-CLR自监督框架，从同一序列中提取多个骨架结构进行对比学习对齐姿态表示，并改进ST-GCN架构以处理不同关节布局和尺度的骨架

Result: 在NTU RGB+D 60和120数据集上显著优于单骨架对比学习方法，多骨架集成进一步提升了性能，达到了新的state-of-the-art结果

Conclusion: 多骨架对比学习能够学习结构不变性和捕捉多样化解剖线索，产生更具表达力和泛化能力的特征表示

Abstract: Contrastive learning has gained significant attention in skeleton-based
action recognition for its ability to learn robust representations from
unlabeled data. However, existing methods rely on a single skeleton convention,
which limits their ability to generalize across datasets with diverse joint
structures and anatomical coverage. We propose Multi-Skeleton Contrastive
Learning (MS-CLR), a general self-supervised framework that aligns pose
representations across multiple skeleton conventions extracted from the same
sequence. This encourages the model to learn structural invariances and capture
diverse anatomical cues, resulting in more expressive and generalizable
features. To support this, we adapt the ST-GCN architecture to handle skeletons
with varying joint layouts and scales through a unified representation scheme.
Experiments on the NTU RGB+D 60 and 120 datasets demonstrate that MS-CLR
consistently improves performance over strong single-skeleton contrastive
learning baselines. A multi-skeleton ensemble further boosts performance,
setting new state-of-the-art results on both datasets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种使用关节化3D高斯分布的统一表示方法，联合建模几何和运动，显著提升了多部件关节物体的重建能力，支持多达20个部件的复杂关节系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常将几何和运动解耦，先重建不同状态下的物体形状，然后通过后处理对齐估计关节运动。这种分离使重建流程复杂化，限制了可扩展性，特别是对于具有复杂多部件关节的物体。

Method: 引入统一的关节化3D高斯表示，联合建模几何和运动。该方法改进了运动分解的鲁棒性，能够处理多达20个部件的关节物体。

Result: 在提出的MPArt-90基准测试中，该方法在部件级几何重建和运动估计方面始终表现出优异的准确性，显著优于先前方法（先前方法通常只能处理2-3个部件）。

Conclusion: 统一的关节化表示在可扩展物理建模中具有巨大潜力，已成功应用于机器人仿真和人-场景交互建模等下游任务。

Abstract: Reconstructing articulated objects is essential for building digital twins of
interactive environments. However, prior methods typically decouple geometry
and motion by first reconstructing object shape in distinct states and then
estimating articulation through post-hoc alignment. This separation complicates
the reconstruction pipeline and restricts scalability, especially for objects
with complex, multi-part articulation. We introduce a unified representation
that jointly models geometry and motion using articulated 3D Gaussians. This
formulation improves robustness in motion decomposition and supports
articulated objects with up to 20 parts, significantly outperforming prior
approaches that often struggle beyond 2--3 parts due to brittle initialization.
To systematically assess scalability and generalization, we propose MPArt-90, a
new benchmark consisting of 90 articulated objects across 20 categories, each
with diverse part counts and motion configurations. Extensive experiments show
that our method consistently achieves superior accuracy in part-level geometry
reconstruction and motion estimation across a broad range of object types. We
further demonstrate applicability to downstream tasks such as robotic
simulation and human-scene interaction modeling, highlighting the potential of
unified articulated representations in scalable physical modeling.

Motivation: 平衡视觉叙事的两个关键方面：既要基于图像序列又要保持叙述连贯性。不同于大多数先前研究的方法论

Method: 采用两阶段框架：1) 使用视觉-语言模型为输入图像生成描述 2) 使用语言-语言方法将描述转化为连贯叙事

Result: 统一框架整合描述和叙事对故事质量有积极影响，加速训练时间，提高框架的可重用性和可复现性

Conclusion: 提出了一种新的视觉叙事方法框架，并引入了名为'理想性'的新度量工具来模拟结果与理想模型的接近程度，可用于模拟人类化叙事

Abstract: Visual Storytelling is a challenging multimodal task between Vision &
Language, where the purpose is to generate a story for a stream of images. Its
difficulty lies on the fact that the story should be both grounded to the image
sequence but also narrative and coherent. The aim of this work is to balance
between these aspects, by treating Visual Storytelling as a superset of Image
Captioning, an approach quite different compared to most of prior relevant
studies. This means that we firstly employ a vision-to-language model for
obtaining captions of the input images, and then, these captions are
transformed into coherent narratives using language-to-language methods. Our
multifarious evaluation shows that integrating captioning and storytelling
under a unified framework, has a positive impact on the quality of the produced
stories. In addition, compared to numerous previous studies, this approach
accelerates training time and makes our framework readily reusable and
reproducible by anyone interested. Lastly, we propose a new metric/tool, named
ideality, that can be used to simulate how far some results are from an oracle
model, and we apply it to emulate human-likeness in visual storytelling.

TL;DR: ShizhenGPT是首个针对中医的多模态大语言模型，通过构建大规模多模态数据集（100GB+文本和200GB+多模态数据）解决了中医数据稀缺和多模态诊断的挑战，在中医资格考试和视觉诊断任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统大语言模型在中医领域应用受限，主要因为高质量中医数据稀缺以及中医诊断固有的多模态特性（望闻问切），这些感官丰富的模态超出了传统LLMs的处理范围。

Method: 构建了迄今为止最大的中医数据集，包含文本和多模态数据（图像、音频、生理信号）；对ShizhenGPT进行预训练和指令微调，使其具备深厚的中医知识和多模态推理能力；建立了中医资格考试和视觉诊断评估基准。

Result: ShizhenGPT在可比规模LLMs中表现最优，能与更大规模的专有模型竞争；在现有多模态LLMs中中医视觉理解领先；展示了跨声音、脉搏、气味和视觉等模态的统一感知能力。

Conclusion: 该研究为中医领域的整体多模态感知和诊断开辟了新途径，数据集、模型和代码均已公开，有望推动该领域的进一步探索。

Abstract: Despite the success of large language models (LLMs) in various domains, their
potential in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) remains largely underexplored
due to two critical barriers: (1) the scarcity of high-quality TCM data and (2)
the inherently multimodal nature of TCM diagnostics, which involve looking,
listening, smelling, and pulse-taking. These sensory-rich modalities are beyond
the scope of conventional LLMs. To address these challenges, we present
ShizhenGPT, the first multimodal LLM tailored for TCM. To overcome data
scarcity, we curate the largest TCM dataset to date, comprising 100GB+ of text
and 200GB+ of multimodal data, including 1.2M images, 200 hours of audio, and
physiological signals. ShizhenGPT is pretrained and instruction-tuned to
achieve deep TCM knowledge and multimodal reasoning. For evaluation, we collect
recent national TCM qualification exams and build a visual benchmark for
Medicinal Recognition and Visual Diagnosis. Experiments demonstrate that
ShizhenGPT outperforms comparable-scale LLMs and competes with larger
proprietary models. Moreover, it leads in TCM visual understanding among
existing multimodal LLMs and demonstrates unified perception across modalities
like sound, pulse, smell, and vision, paving the way toward holistic multimodal
perception and diagnosis in TCM. Datasets, models, and code are publicly
available. We hope this work will inspire further exploration in this field.

Method: 基于大语言模型（LLM）注释的可比英汉新闻语料库，从功能块角度分析具有状语角色的成分顺序差异，重点研究其位置偏好和分布模式。

Result: 发现：1）英语新闻偏向核心信息先行的线性叙述，功能块多后置；汉语新闻偏向背景先行的整体呈现，功能块常前置。2）SVO结构中，汉语前置偏向更显著，英语后置偏向相对温和。3）功能块共现时，两种语言都显示高灵活性，顺序调整受信息和语用目的驱动。

Conclusion: 词序具有系统性偏好和动态适应性的双重特征，这一研究为英汉信息结构对比研究提供了新的实证支持。

Abstract: Based on comparable English-Chinese news corpora annotated by Large Language
Model (LLM), this paper attempts to explore the differences in constituent
order of English-Chinese news from the perspective of functional chunks with
adverbial roles, and analyze their typical positional preferences and
distribution patterns. It is found that: (1) English news prefers linear
narrative of core information first, and functional chunks are mostly
post-positioned, while Chinese news prefers overall presentation mode of
background first, and functional chunks are often pre-positioned; (2) In SVO
structure, both English and Chinese news show differences in the distribution
of functional chunks, but the tendency of Chinese pre-positioning is more
significant, while that of English post-positioning is relatively mild; (3)
When function blocks are co-occurring, both English and Chinese news show high
flexibility, and the order adjustment is driven by information and pragmatic
purposes. The study reveals that word order has both systematic preference and
dynamic adaptability, providing new empirical support for contrastive study of
English-Chinese information structure.

Motivation: 文本到SQL转换中需要评估模型生成SQL查询的可靠性，但在无法访问模型权重和梯度的约束条件下，特别是在大型语言模型环境中，置信度估计成为一个重要挑战。

Method: 探索了黑盒和白盒两种置信度估计策略：黑盒方法使用基于一致性的技术，白盒方法利用SQL语法感知的方法来解释LLM的logits，并引入执行结果作为补充信号。

Result: 评估显示基于一致性的黑盒方法表现优异，SQL语法感知的白盒方法在解释LLM logits方面具有优势，执行结果的加入进一步提升了两种方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 在跨域文本到SQL基准测试中，结合执行结果的基于一致性黑盒方法和SQL语法感知白盒方法能够有效估计LLM生成SQL查询的置信度，为实际应用提供了可靠的技术方案。

Abstract: Confidence estimation for text-to-SQL aims to assess the reliability of
model-generated SQL queries without having access to gold answers. We study
this problem in the context of large language models (LLMs), where access to
model weights and gradients is often constrained. We explore both black-box and
white-box confidence estimation strategies, evaluating their effectiveness on
cross-domain text-to-SQL benchmarks. Our evaluation highlights the superior
performance of consistency-based methods among black-box models and the
advantage of SQL-syntax-aware approaches for interpreting LLM logits in
white-box settings. Furthermore, we show that execution-based grounding of
queries provides a valuable supplementary signal, improving the effectiveness
of both approaches.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文分析了LLM微调过程中的数据记忆化隐私风险，提出了多层隐私保护框架，在保持94.7%模型效用的同时将数据泄露率降至0%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在微调过程中容易记忆训练数据，造成严重的隐私泄露风险，需要有效的保护机制。

Method: 提出包含语义数据去重、差分隐私生成、基于熵的过滤和基于模式的过滤的四层隐私保护框架，并在GPT-2、Phi-3和Gemma-2等模型上进行实验验证。

Result: 实验显示微调重复敏感数据使隐私泄露率从0-5%增至60-75%，平均增加64.2%。提出的保护方法能将泄露率降至0%，同时保持94.7%的模型效用。

Conclusion: 多层隐私保护框架能有效解决LLM微调中的数据记忆化问题，在几乎不影响模型性能的情况下完全消除隐私泄露风险。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
diverse natural language processing tasks, but their tendency to memorize
training data poses significant privacy risks, particularly during fine-tuning
processes. This paper presents a comprehensive empirical analysis of data
memorization in fine-tuned LLMs and introduces a novel multi-layered privacy
protection framework. Through controlled experiments on modern LLM
architectures including GPT-2, Phi-3, and Gemma-2, we demonstrate that
fine-tuning with repeated sensitive data increases privacy leakage rates from
baseline levels of 0-5% to 60-75%, representing a 64.2% average increase across
tested models. We propose and rigorously evaluate four complementary privacy
protection methods: semantic data deduplication, differential privacy during
generation, entropy-based filtering, and pattern-based content filtering. Our
experimental results show that these techniques can reduce data leakage to 0%
while maintaining 94.7% of original model utility.

### [81] [Punctuation and Predicates in Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14067)
*Sonakshi Chauhan,Maheep Chaudhary,Koby Choy,Samuel Nellessen,Nandi Schoots*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文研究了大型语言模型中信息收集和传播的机制，特别关注标点符号的计算重要性以及不同推理规则的处理方式。通过干预实验发现不同模型对标点符号的依赖程度存在显著差异，并揭示了条件语句和全称量化等推理规则在模型中的不同处理机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索大型语言模型中信息如何在不同层间收集和传播，特别是标点符号作为注意力汇聚点和记忆辅助工具的计算重要性，以及不同推理组件在模型中的处理机制。

Method: 使用基于干预的技术，包括互换干预和层交换实验，在GPT-2、DeepSeek和Gemma模型上评估标点符号的必要性和充分性，并研究条件语句和全称量化等推理规则的处理方式。

Result: 发现模型间存在显著差异：GPT-2在多个层中标点符号既必要又充分，DeepSeek中程度较低，Gemma中完全不成立。条件语句和全称量化等推理规则在模型中以不同方式处理。

Conclusion: 研究为理解LLM中标点符号使用和推理的内部机制提供了新见解，对模型可解释性具有重要意义，揭示了不同模型在处理标点和推理规则时的架构差异。

Abstract: In this paper we explore where information is collected and how it is
propagated throughout layers in large language models (LLMs). We begin by
examining the surprising computational importance of punctuation tokens which
previous work has identified as attention sinks and memory aids. Using
intervention-based techniques, we evaluate the necessity and sufficiency (for
preserving model performance) of punctuation tokens across layers in GPT-2,
DeepSeek, and Gemma. Our results show stark model-specific differences: for
GPT-2, punctuation is both necessary and sufficient in multiple layers, while
this holds far less in DeepSeek and not at all in Gemma. Extending beyond
punctuation, we ask whether LLMs process different components of input (e.g.,
subjects, adjectives, punctuation, full sentences) by forming early static
summaries reused across the network, or if the model remains sensitive to
changes in these components across layers. Extending beyond punctuation, we
investigate whether different reasoning rules are processed differently by
LLMs. In particular, through interchange intervention and layer-swapping
experiments, we find that conditional statements (if, then), and universal
quantification (for all) are processed very differently. Our findings offer new
insight into the internal mechanisms of punctuation usage and reasoning in LLMs
and have implications for interpretability.

### [82] [DLLMQuant: Quantizing Diffusion-based Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14090)
*Chen Xu,Dawei Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DLLMQuant是一个专门为扩散式大语言模型设计的后训练量化框架，通过时间-掩码自适应采样、交互感知激活量化和确定性引导量化三大技术，解决了现有PTQ方法在DLLMs上的严重精度下降问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散式大语言模型在非自回归文本生成方面表现出色，但直接应用现有的后训练量化方法会导致严重的精度下降（如AWQ在W4A4配置下精度下降16%），主要原因是DLLMs的动态掩码、迭代生成和双向注意力机制与量化方法不兼容。

Method: 提出了DLLMQuant框架，包含三个核心技术：1）时间-掩码自适应采样（TMAS）考虑时间和掩码因素的校准方法；2）交互感知激活量化（IA-AQ）利用双向注意力交互信号动态分配量化资源；3）确定性引导量化（CGQ）整合掩码状态和token分数作为误差补偿的关键权重标准。

Result: 实验表明DLLMQuant在保持效率的同时实现了显著的性能提升，有效解决了量化误差在迭代过程中的累积和放大问题。

Conclusion: DLLMQuant为扩散式大语言模型的量化部署提供了有效的解决方案，通过专门针对DLLMs特性的量化技术，成功克服了现有PTQ方法的不兼容性问题。

Abstract: Diffusion-based large language models (DLLMs) have shown promise for
non-autoregressive text generation, but their deployment is constrained by
large model sizes and heavy computational costs. Post-training quantization
(PTQ), a widely used method for compressing and accelerating Large Language
Models (LLMs), suffers from severe accuracy degradation and reduced
generalization performance when directly applied to DLLMs (e.g., AWQ suffers a
16% accuracy drop on LLADA under W4A4). This paper explores how DLLMs' key
mechanisms - dynamic masking, iterative generation, bidirectional attention -
clash with quantization. We identify three core issues: 1) Iterative generation
and dynamic masking ratios lead to distinct token distributions across decoding
steps, which are not adequately captured by existing PTQ calibration methods;
2) Quantization errors are accumulated and amplified progressively during
iteration in DLLMs, causing quantized models to perform worse as decoding steps
progress; 3) Unmasked tokens stabilize while masked remain probabilistic,
making overall feature distribution incompatible with existing PTQ methods. To
address these issues, we propose DLLMQuant, a PTQ framework tailored for DLLMs,
which incorporates three novel techniques: 1) Temporal-Mask Adaptive Sampling
(TMAS), a calibration method that accounts for both time and mask factors, with
the capacity to capture distributions across timesteps. 2) Interaction-Aware
Activation Quantization (IA-AQ), which utilizes bidirectional attention's
interaction signals to dynamically allocate quantization resources. 3)
Certainty-Guided Quantization (CGQ), which integrates mask status and token
scores as key weighting criteria into error compensation, making weight
quantization more suitable for DLLMs. Experiments show that DLLMQuant achieves
significant performance gains while enhancing efficiency.

### [83] [MMReview: A Multidisciplinary and Multimodal Benchmark for LLM-Based Peer Review Automation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14146)
*Xian Gao,Jiacheng Ruan,Zongyun Zhang,Jingsheng Gao,Ting Liu,Yuzhuo Fu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了MMReview基准测试，用于评估大语言模型和多模态大语言模型在学术论文同行评审中的表现，涵盖多学科和多模态内容。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着学术出版物快速增长，同行评审变得重要但耗时。现有LLM辅助评审缺乏统一的评估基准，特别是在处理包含图表等多模态内容的场景时。

Method: 构建包含240篇论文、17个研究领域、4大学科的多模态数据集，设计13个任务分为4个核心类别，评估模型在逐步评审生成、结果制定、人类偏好对齐和对抗性输入鲁棒性方面的表现。

Result: 在16个开源模型和5个先进闭源模型上进行了广泛实验，证明了基准测试的全面性。

Conclusion: MMReview为建立自动化同行评审系统的标准化基础迈出了关键一步。

Abstract: With the rapid growth of academic publications, peer review has become an
essential yet time-consuming responsibility within the research community.
Large Language Models (LLMs) have increasingly been adopted to assist in the
generation of review comments; however, current LLM-based review tasks lack a
unified evaluation benchmark to rigorously assess the models' ability to
produce comprehensive, accurate, and human-aligned assessments, particularly in
scenarios involving multimodal content such as figures and tables. To address
this gap, we propose \textbf{MMReview}, a comprehensive benchmark that spans
multiple disciplines and modalities. MMReview includes multimodal content and
expert-written review comments for 240 papers across 17 research domains within
four major academic disciplines: Artificial Intelligence, Natural Sciences,
Engineering Sciences, and Social Sciences. We design a total of 13 tasks
grouped into four core categories, aimed at evaluating the performance of LLMs
and Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) in step-wise review generation, outcome
formulation, alignment with human preferences, and robustness to adversarial
input manipulation. Extensive experiments conducted on 16 open-source models
and 5 advanced closed-source models demonstrate the thoroughness of the
benchmark. We envision MMReview as a critical step toward establishing a
standardized foundation for the development of automated peer review systems.

### [84] [DPad: Efficient Diffusion Language Models with Suffix Dropout](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14148)
*Xinhua Chen,Sitao Huang,Cong Guo,Chiyue Wei,Yintao He,Jianyi Zhang,Hai "Hellen" Li,Yiran Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DPad是一种无需训练的方法，通过滑动窗口和距离衰减dropout策略，显著降低基于扩散的大语言模型的计算开销，实现最高61.4倍的加速，同时保持相当的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于扩散的大语言模型(dLLMs)在文本生成时存在高计算开销问题，因为它们在每一步预测所有未来后缀token但只保留一小部分，造成大量冗余计算。

Method: 提出Diffusion Scratchpad (DPad)方法，包含两种策略：(1)滑动窗口保持固定长度的后缀窗口；(2)距离衰减dropout在注意力计算前确定性地移除远处后缀token。该方法与现有优化技术兼容且易于实现。

Result: 在LLaDA-1.5和Dream模型上的多基准测试表明，DPad相比原始dLLMs实现最高61.4倍的加速，同时保持可比的准确性。

Conclusion: DPad为高效和可扩展的长序列推理提供了有效解决方案，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Diffusion-based Large Language Models (dLLMs) parallelize text generation by
framing decoding as a denoising process, but suffer from high computational
overhead since they predict all future suffix tokens at each step while
retaining only a small fraction. We propose Diffusion Scratchpad (DPad), a
training-free method that restricts attention to a small set of nearby suffix
tokens, preserving fidelity while eliminating redundancy. DPad integrates two
strategies: (i) a sliding window, which maintains a fixed-length suffix window,
and (ii) distance-decay dropout, which deterministically removes distant suffix
tokens before attention computation. This simple design is compatible with
existing optimizations such as prefix caching and can be implemented with only
a few lines of code. Comprehensive evaluations across multiple benchmarks on
LLaDA-1.5 and Dream models demonstrate that DPad delivers up to
$\mathbf{61.4\times}$ speedup over vanilla dLLMs while maintaining comparable
accuracy, highlighting its potential for efficient and scalable long-sequence
inference. Our code is available at https://github.com/Crys-Chen/DPad.

### [85] [Comparing energy consumption and accuracy in text classification inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14170)
*Johannes Zschache,Tilman Hartwig*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文系统性评估了大型语言模型在文本分类推理任务中的准确性与能消耗的拼换关系，发现最优准确性模型同时也能实现能消效率，而过大的LLM反而能消更高且准确性更低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型语言模型在NLP任务中的普及，能源效率和可持续性成为重要关注点。虽然之前研究主要集中在模型训练阶段的能消耗，但推理阶段的能消耗研究相对缺乏。

Method: 采用系统化评估方法，在多种模型架构和硬件配置下分析文本分类推理任务中的准确性与能消耗的拼换关系。

Result: 实验分析显示：最优准确性模型同时具有能消效率，而过大的LLM能消显著增加但分类准确性更低。推理能消在小于毫瓦时到大于千瓦时范围内变化，主要受模型类型、模型大小和硬件规格影响。推理能消与模型运行时间呈强相关关系。

Conclusion: 这些发现对可持续AI发展具有重要意义，为研究人员、业界实践者和政策制定者提供了在NLP应用中平衡性能与资源效率的可操作见解。执行时间可作为无法直接测量能消情况下的实用代理指标。

Abstract: The increasing deployment of large language models (LLMs) in natural language
processing (NLP) tasks raises concerns about energy efficiency and
sustainability. While prior research has largely focused on energy consumption
during model training, the inference phase has received comparatively less
attention. This study systematically evaluates the trade-offs between model
accuracy and energy consumption in text classification inference across various
model architectures and hardware configurations. Our empirical analysis shows
that the best-performing model in terms of accuracy can also be
energy-efficient, while larger LLMs tend to consume significantly more energy
with lower classification accuracy. We observe substantial variability in
inference energy consumption ($<$mWh to $>$kWh), influenced by model type,
model size, and hardware specifications. Additionally, we find a strong
correlation between inference energy consumption and model runtime, indicating
that execution time can serve as a practical proxy for energy usage in settings
where direct measurement is not feasible. These findings have implications for
sustainable AI development, providing actionable insights for researchers,
industry practitioners, and policymakers seeking to balance performance and
resource efficiency in NLP applications.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了SciIG任务来评估LLM生成研究论文引言的能力，在NAACL 2025和ICLR 2025数据集上测试了5个先进模型，发现LLaMA-4 Maverick在语义相似性和忠实度方面表现最佳，三样本提示效果最好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着研究人员越来越多地使用LLM作为写作助手，生成高质量的研究论文引言仍然具有挑战性且至关重要。需要系统评估LLM在这方面的能力。

Method: 创建了SciIG任务，从NAACL 2025和ICLR 2025论文中整理新数据集，评估了5个最先进模型（包括开源和闭源系统），使用自动指标和LLM作为评判的评估框架，涵盖词汇重叠、语义相似性、内容覆盖、忠实度、一致性、引用正确性和叙述质量等多个维度。

Result: LLaMA-4 Maverick在大多数指标上表现最优，特别是在语义相似性和忠实度方面。三样本提示方法持续优于较少样本的方法。

Conclusion: 这些发现为开发有效的研究写作助手提供了实用见解，并为LLM辅助学术写作设定了现实期望。所有代码和数据集将公开发布以促进可重复性和未来研究。

Abstract: As researchers increasingly adopt LLMs as writing assistants, generating
high-quality research paper introductions remains both challenging and
essential. We introduce Scientific Introduction Generation (SciIG), a task that
evaluates LLMs' ability to produce coherent introductions from titles,
abstracts, and related works. Curating new datasets from NAACL 2025 and ICLR
2025 papers, we assess five state-of-the-art models, including both open-source
(DeepSeek-v3, Gemma-3-12B, LLaMA 4-Maverick, MistralAI Small 3.1) and
closed-source GPT-4o systems, across multiple dimensions: lexical overlap,
semantic similarity, content coverage, faithfulness, consistency, citation
correctness, and narrative quality. Our comprehensive framework combines
automated metrics with LLM-as-a-judge evaluations. Results demonstrate LLaMA-4
Maverick's superior performance on most metrics, particularly in semantic
similarity and faithfulness. Moreover, three-shot prompting consistently
outperforms fewer-shot approaches. These findings provide practical insights
into developing effective research writing assistants and set realistic
expectations for LLM-assisted academic writing. To foster reproducibility and
future research, we will publicly release all code and datasets.

*Cliff O'Reilly,Ernesto Jimenez-Ruiz,Tillman Weyde*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 通过多语言概念激活平均法，从LLM中提取语义概念表示，提高与本体类真实关系的对齐度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM中语义与语法、语言信息纠缠的问题，实现更好的形式化知识表示和推理

Method: 使用稀疏自编码器获取概念激活，对英语、法语、中文三种语言版本的本体类文本进行激活值平均，得到概念平均表示

Result: 概念平均表示相比单语言版本能更好地与本体类真实关系对齐，表明该方法能更准确地解释网络内部状态

Conclusion: 多语言概念激活平均是一种有效的新技术，可提高对LLM内部机制的解读精度

Abstract: Connecting LLMs with formal knowledge representation and reasoning is a
promising approach to address their shortcomings. Embeddings and sparse
autoencoders are widely used to represent textual content, but the semantics
are entangled with syntactic and language-specific information. We propose a
method that isolates concept semantics in Large Langue Models by averaging
concept activations derived via Sparse Autoencoders. We create English text
representations from OWL ontology classes, translate the English into French
and Chinese and then pass these texts as prompts to the Gemma 2B LLM. Using the
open source Gemma Scope suite of Sparse Autoencoders, we obtain concept
activations for each class and language version. We average the different
language activations to derive a conceptual average. We then correlate the
conceptual averages with a ground truth mapping between ontology classes. Our
results give a strong indication that the conceptual average aligns to the true
relationship between classes when compared with a single language by itself.
The result hints at a new technique which enables mechanistic interpretation of
internal network states with higher accuracy.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GRILE是首个罗马尼亚语教育基准测试，包含1151道选择题，用于评估多语言和罗马尼亚语LLMs在答题和生成准确语言解释方面的能力。研究发现大多数开源模型准确率低于65%，48%的解释存在事实或教学错误。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估LLMs在低资源语言（罗马尼亚语）教育场景中的教学价值，填补现有基准测试的空白。

Method: 构建包含1151道罗马尼亚语高利害考试选择题的基准测试GRILE，评估7个最先进的多语言和罗马尼亚语专用LLMs的答题准确性和解释质量。

Result: Gemini 2.5 Pro达到83%准确率，但大多数开源模型低于65%，48%的解释存在错误。系统弱点集中在形态学和最新DOOM3正字法规范应用方面。

Conclusion: GRILE基准测试揭示了低资源教育NLP的可信挑战，为可控解释生成和评估提供了新的测试平台。

Abstract: LLMs (Large language models) have revolutionized NLP (Natural Language
Processing), yet their pedagogical value for low-resource languages remains
unclear. We present GRILE (Grammar Romanian Inference and Language
Explanations) , the first open benchmark of 1,151 multiple-choice questions
harvested from Romanian high-stakes exams (National Evaluation, Baccalaureate,
university admissions). GRILE enables us to probe two complementary abilities
of seven state-of-the-art multilingual and Romanian-specific LLMs: (i)
selecting the correct answer, and (ii) producing linguistically accurate
explanations. While Gemini 2.5 Pro reaches 83% accuracy, most open-weight
models stay below 65%, and 48% of their explanations contain factual or
pedagogical flaws according to expert review. A detailed error analysis
pinpoints systematic weaknesses in morphology and in applying the latest DOOM3
orthographic norms. All data, code and a public web demo are released to
catalyze future research. Our findings expose open challenges for trustworthy
educational NLP in low-resource settings and establish GRILE as a new test-bed
for controllable explanation generation and evaluation.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合基于规则的形态分析和统计子词分割的混合分词框架，针对形态丰富和粘着语言的分词问题，在土耳其语上取得了最佳性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的子词分词方法（如BPE和WordPiece）主要依赖频率统计，在处理形态丰富和粘着语言时效果不佳，因为它们忽略了语言结构信息。

Method: 采用混合分词框架，结合音位规范化、词根-词缀词典和新型算法来平衡语素保留与词汇效率。使用共享标识符处理音位变体，集成BPE处理未登录词，并添加特殊标记处理空格和大小写。

Result: 在TR-MMLU基准测试中，该分词器获得了最高的土耳其语分词百分比（90.29%）和纯分词百分比（85.8%），相比LLaMA、Gemma和GPT的分词器产生更语言学意义明确的token。

Conclusion: 该方法虽然以土耳其语为演示，但具有语言无关性，可适配到其他语言，为构建更可解释和有效的多语言NLP系统提供了实用路径。

Abstract: Tokenization plays a pivotal role in natural language processing (NLP),
shaping how text is segmented and interpreted by language models. While subword
methods such as Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) and WordPiece have been effective,
they often struggle with morphologically rich and agglutinative languages
because they rely on frequency rather than linguistic structure. We introduce a
hybrid tokenization framework that combines rule-based morphological analysis
with statistical subword segmentation. The method uses phonological
normalization, root-affix dictionaries, and a novel algorithm that balances
morpheme preservation with vocabulary efficiency. It assigns shared identifiers
to phonologically variant affixes (e.g., -ler and -lar) and altered root forms
(e.g., kitap vs. kitab{\i}), reducing redundancy while maintaining semantic
integrity. Special tokens are added for whitespace and case, including an
UPPERCASE marker to avoid vocabulary inflation from capitalization. BPE is
integrated for out-of-vocabulary coverage without harming morphological
coherence. On the TR-MMLU benchmark, the tokenizer achieves the highest Turkish
Token Percentage (90.29\%) and Pure Token Percentage (85.8\%). Comparisons with
tokenizers from LLaMA, Gemma, and GPT show more linguistically meaningful and
coherent tokens. Although demonstrated on Turkish, the approach is
language-independent and adaptable to other languages, offering a practical
path toward more interpretable and effective multilingual NLP systems.

Motivation: 为了解决多语言形态句法分析任务，需要同时预测形态和句法分析，遵循新的UD标注方案。

Method: 使用共享的XLM-RoBERTa编码器配合三个专用解码器：内容词识别、依存句法分析和形态句法特征预测。

Result: 在九种类型多样的语言上获得最佳性能，平均MSLAS 78.7%、LAS 80.1%、Feats F1 90.3%。消融研究表明黄金分词和内容词识别对性能至关重要。

Conclusion: 模型在多语言形态句法分析任务中表现优异，但在核心语法格（特别是Nom-Acc）和名词特征方面仍存在挑战。

Abstract: We present a joint multitask model for the UniDive 2025 Morpho-Syntactic
Parsing shared task, where systems predict both morphological and syntactic
analyses following novel UD annotation scheme. Our system uses a shared
XLM-RoBERTa encoder with three specialized decoders for content word
identification, dependency parsing, and morphosyntactic feature prediction. Our
model achieves the best overall performance on the shared task's leaderboard
covering nine typologically diverse languages, with an average MSLAS score of
78.7 percent, LAS of 80.1 percent, and Feats F1 of 90.3 percent. Our ablation
studies show that matching the task's gold tokenization and content word
identification are crucial to model performance. Error analysis reveals that
our model struggles with core grammatical cases (particularly Nom-Acc) and
nominal features across languages.

TL;DR: Finch-Zk是一个黑盒框架，通过跨模型一致性检查来检测和缓解LLM幻觉，无需外部知识源，在检测和缓解方面都取得了显著效果提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型虽然能力强大，但容易产生看似合理但包含事实错误的幻觉内容，需要有效的检测和缓解方法。

Method: 采用跨模型一致性检查策略，通过比较不同模型对语义等价提示的响应来发现细粒度不准确性，并使用针对性缓解技术对问题片段进行精确修正。

Result: 在FELM数据集上，幻觉检测F1分数比现有方法提升6-39%；在GPQA-diamond数据集上，应用于Llama 4 Maverick和Claude 4 Sonnet等先进模型时，答案准确率绝对提升7-8个百分点。

Conclusion: Finch-Zk为生产LLM系统提供了实用的、可部署的安全保障，能够显著增强事实可靠性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities across
diverse tasks, but they remain susceptible to hallucinations--generating
content that appears plausible but contains factual inaccuracies. We present
Finch-Zk, a black-box framework that leverages FINe-grained Cross-model
consistency to detect and mitigate Hallucinations in LLM outputs without
requiring external knowledge sources. Finch-Zk introduces two key innovations:
1) a cross-model consistency checking strategy that reveals fine-grained
inaccuracies by comparing responses generated by diverse models from
semantically-equivalent prompts, and 2) a targeted mitigation technique that
applies precise corrections to problematic segments while preserving accurate
content. Experiments on the FELM dataset show Finch-Zk improves hallucination
detection F1 scores by 6-39\% compared to existing approaches. For mitigation,
Finch-Zk achieves 7-8 absolute percentage points improvement in answer accuracy
on the GPQA-diamond dataset when applied to state-of-the-art models like Llama
4 Maverick and Claude 4 Sonnet. Extensive evaluation across multiple models
demonstrates that Finch-Zk provides a practical, deployment-ready safeguard for
enhancing factual reliability in production LLM systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于大语言模型的综述生成方法在保持长篇多章节综述的连贯性和提供全面引用覆盖方面存在困难，需要新的自动化解决方案来提升科学文献综述的质量。

Method: 采用粗到细检索策略，首先进行综述级别的检索构建初始大纲和写作计划，然后通过记忆机制动态优化，在检测到上下文不足时触发细粒度子章节检索，利用记忆机制保持各子章节的连贯性。

Result: 在四个科学领域的实验中，SurveyGen-I在内容质量、一致性和引用覆盖方面持续优于先前的工作。

Conclusion: SurveyGen-I框架通过创新的检索和记忆机制，有效解决了自动综述生成中的连贯性和引用完整性问题，为科学文献的自动化整理提供了可靠解决方案。

Abstract: Survey papers play a critical role in scientific communication by
consolidating progress across a field. Recent advances in Large Language Models
(LLMs) offer a promising solution by automating key steps in the
survey-generation pipeline, such as retrieval, structuring, and summarization.
However, existing LLM-based approaches often struggle with maintaining
coherence across long, multi-section surveys and providing comprehensive
citation coverage. To address these limitations, we introduce SurveyGen-I, an
automatic survey generation framework that combines coarse-to-fine retrieval,
adaptive planning, and memory-guided generation. SurveyGen-I first performs
survey-level retrieval to construct the initial outline and writing plan, and
then dynamically refines both during generation through a memory mechanism that
stores previously written content and terminology, ensuring coherence across
subsections. When the system detects insufficient context, it triggers
fine-grained subsection-level retrieval. During generation, SurveyGen-I
leverages this memory mechanism to maintain coherence across subsections.
Experiments across four scientific domains demonstrate that SurveyGen-I
consistently outperforms previous works in content quality, consistency, and
citation coverage.

Abstract: Tool-augmented large language models (LLMs) leverage external functions to
extend their capabilities, but inaccurate function calls can lead to
inefficiencies and increased costs.Existing methods address this challenge by
fine-tuning LLMs or using demonstration-based prompting, yet they often suffer
from high training overhead and fail to account for inconsistent demonstration
samples, which misguide the model's invocation behavior. In this paper, we
trained a behavior-aligned retriever (BAR), which provides behaviorally
consistent demonstrations to help LLMs make more accurate tool-using decisions.
To train the BAR, we construct a corpus including different function-calling
behaviors, i.e., calling or non-calling.We use the contrastive learning
framework to train the BAR with customized positive/negative pairs and a
dual-negative contrastive loss, ensuring robust retrieval of behaviorally
consistent examples.Experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly
reduces erroneous function calls while maintaining high task performance,
offering a cost-effective and efficient solution for tool-augmented LLMs.

TL;DR: 该研究引入ZPD-SCA基准评估大语言模型在中文阅读理解难度分级方面的能力，发现LLMs在零样本学习下表现不佳，但在上下文学习后性能显著提升，但仍存在系统性偏差和跨文体性能差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 填补大语言模型在评估阅读材料与学生认知发展阶段匹配度方面的研究空白，特别是在中文教育背景下，基于最近发展区(ZPD)理论验证LLMs的教育应用潜力。

Method: 构建由60位特级教师标注的ZPD-SCA基准数据集，通过零样本学习和上下文学习两种设置测试多个LLMs模型的中文阅读理解难度评估能力。

Result: LLMs在零样本学习下表现较差(Qwen-max和GLM甚至低于随机猜测概率)，但在提供上下文示例后性能大幅提升(部分模型准确率翻倍)。模型存在系统性方向偏差和跨文体性能差异。

Conclusion: LLMs具备评估阅读难度的新兴能力，但当前训练在教育对齐判断方面存在局限。ZPD-SCA基准可为认知对齐教育应用的LLMs评估和改进提供基础。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated potential in educational
applications, yet their capacity to accurately assess the cognitive alignment
of reading materials with students' developmental stages remains insufficiently
explored. This gap is particularly critical given the foundational educational
principle of the Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD), which emphasizes the need
to match learning resources with Students' Cognitive Abilities (SCA). Despite
the importance of this alignment, there is a notable absence of comprehensive
studies investigating LLMs' ability to evaluate reading comprehension
difficulty across different student age groups, especially in the context of
Chinese language education. To fill this gap, we introduce ZPD-SCA, a novel
benchmark specifically designed to assess stage-level Chinese reading
comprehension difficulty. The benchmark is annotated by 60 Special Grade
teachers, a group that represents the top 0.15% of all in-service teachers
nationwide. Experimental results reveal that LLMs perform poorly in zero-shot
learning scenarios, with Qwen-max and GLM even falling below the probability of
random guessing. When provided with in-context examples, LLMs performance
improves substantially, with some models achieving nearly double the accuracy
of their zero-shot baselines. These results reveal that LLMs possess emerging
abilities to assess reading difficulty, while also exposing limitations in
their current training for educationally aligned judgment. Notably, even the
best-performing models display systematic directional biases, suggesting
difficulties in accurately aligning material difficulty with SCA. Furthermore,
significant variations in model performance across different genres underscore
the complexity of task. We envision that ZPD-SCA can provide a foundation for
evaluating and improving LLMs in cognitively aligned educational applications.

Result: 在多种模型和游戏配置下进行了范围广泓的实验，在评估指标上均实现了一致的改善效果。

Conclusion: 游戏化提示是一种有效的大语言模型检验策略，具有很大的应用潜力。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in
decision-critical domains, it becomes essential to ensure that their confidence
estimates faithfully correspond to their actual correctness. Existing
calibration methods have primarily focused on post-hoc adjustments or auxiliary
model training; however, many of these approaches necessitate additional
supervision or parameter updates. In this work, we propose a novel prompt-based
calibration framework inspired by the Credence Calibration Game. Our method
establishes a structured interaction loop wherein LLMs receive feedback based
on the alignment of their predicted confidence with correctness. Through
feedback-driven prompting and natural language summaries of prior performance,
our framework dynamically improves model calibration. Extensive experiments
across models and game configurations demonstrate consistent improvements in
evaluation metrics. Our results highlight the potential of game-based prompting
as an effective strategy for LLM calibration. Code and data are available at

TL;DR: DEPTH是一个关系抽取框架，通过依赖感知的句子简化和两层层次化精炼来减少LLM在关系抽取中的幻觉问题，显著降低幻觉率并提升F1分数


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在关系抽取中经常产生虚假预测，特别是在复杂句子结构和语义情况下，这会导致知识图谱中出现噪声边，影响结构化知识的完整性和下游应用的可靠性

Method: DEPTH框架包含两个阶段：1) Grounding模块利用最短依赖路径提取关系，将句子蒸馏为最小但连贯的关系上下文；2) Refinement模块聚合所有局部预测并基于句子整体理解进行修正。还引入了因果驱动的奖励模型来缓解奖励黑客问题

Result: 在六个基准测试上，DEPTH将平均幻觉率降低到7.0%，同时相比最先进的基线方法平均F1分数提升了17.2%

Conclusion: DEPTH通过整合依赖感知的句子简化和层次化精炼，有效解决了LLM在关系抽取中的幻觉问题，显著提升了关系抽取的准确性和可靠性

Abstract: Relation extraction enables the construction of structured knowledge for many
downstream applications. While large language models (LLMs) have shown great
promise in this domain, most existing methods concentrate on relation
classification, which predicts the semantic relation type between a related
entity pair. However, we observe that LLMs often struggle to reliably determine
whether a relation exists, especially in cases involving complex sentence
structures or intricate semantics, which leads to spurious predictions. Such
hallucinations can introduce noisy edges in knowledge graphs, compromising the
integrity of structured knowledge and downstream reliability. To address these
challenges, we propose DEPTH, a framework that integrates Dependency-aware
sEntence simPlification and Two-tiered Hierarchical refinement into the
relation extraction pipeline. Given a sentence and its candidate entity pairs,
DEPTH operates in two stages: (1) the Grounding module extracts relations for
each pair by leveraging their shortest dependency path, distilling the sentence
into a minimal yet coherent relational context that reduces syntactic noise
while preserving key semantics; (2) the Refinement module aggregates all local
predictions and revises them based on a holistic understanding of the sentence,
correcting omissions and inconsistencies. We further introduce a
causality-driven reward model that mitigates reward hacking by disentangling
spurious correlations, enabling robust fine-tuning via reinforcement learning
with human feedback. Experiments on six benchmarks demonstrate that DEPTH
reduces the average hallucination rate to 7.0\% while achieving a 17.2\%
improvement in average F1 score over state-of-the-art baselines.

TL;DR: 本文研究发现LLMs在单独呈现范式(IPP)下难以识别自身生成文本，提出了隐性领域意识(ITA)概念和认知外科(CoSur)框架来唤醒这种能力，显著提升了三种LLMs在IPP下的识别准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究表明LLMs在成对呈现范式(PPP)下能可靠识别自身生成文本，但在单独呈现范式(IPP)下性能急剧下降，这种现象的原因尚未得到系统分析。

Method: 提出认知外科(CoSur)框架，包含四个模块：表示提取、领域构建、作者身份判别和认知编辑，通过唤醒模型的隐性领域意识(ITA)来提升IPP下的识别能力。

Result: 实验结果表明，CoSur方法显著提升了三种不同LLMs在IPP场景下的性能，平均准确率分别达到83.25%、66.19%和88.01%。

Conclusion: LLMs具有潜在的自我识别能力(ITA)，但需要特定方法唤醒；CoSur框架有效提升了LLMs在单独文本识别场景下的表现，为理解LLMs的自我认知机制提供了新视角。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been shown to possess a degree of
self-recognition capability-the ability to identify whether a given text was
generated by themselves. Prior work has demonstrated that this capability is
reliably expressed under the Pair Presentation Paradigm (PPP), where the model
is presented with two texts and asked to choose which one it authored. However,
performance deteriorates sharply under the Individual Presentation Paradigm
(IPP), where the model is given a single text to judge authorship. Although
this phenomenon has been observed, its underlying causes have not been
systematically analyzed. In this paper, we first replicate existing findings to
confirm that LLMs struggle to distinguish self- from other-generated text under
IPP. We then investigate the reasons for this failure and attribute it to a
phenomenon we term Implicit Territorial Awareness (ITA)-the model's latent
ability to distinguish self- and other-texts in representational space, which
remains unexpressed in its output behavior. To awaken the ITA of LLMs, we
propose Cognitive Surgery (CoSur), a novel framework comprising four main
modules: representation extraction, territory construction, authorship
discrimination and cognitive editing. Experimental results demonstrate that our
proposed method improves the performance of three different LLMs in the IPP
scenario, achieving average accuracies of 83.25%, 66.19%, and 88.01%,
respectively.

Abstract: This paper addresses the problems of missing reasoning chains and
insufficient entity-level semantic understanding in large language models when
dealing with tasks that require structured knowledge. It proposes a fine-tuning
algorithm framework based on knowledge graph injection. The method builds on
pretrained language models and introduces structured graph information for
auxiliary learning. A graph neural network is used to encode entities and their
relations, constructing a graph-based semantic representation. A fusion
mechanism is then designed to jointly model the knowledge graph embeddings with
the contextual representations from the language model. To enhance the
robustness of knowledge integration, a gating mechanism is introduced to
dynamically balance the contributions of linguistic semantics and structural
knowledge. This effectively mitigates conflicts between different
representational spaces. During training, a joint loss function is constructed
to account for both task performance and structural alignment objectives. This
helps improve the accuracy of entity prediction and semantic reasoning. The
study also includes a series of systematic sensitivity experiments. It
evaluates the effects of learning rate, graph coverage, and structural
perturbations on model performance. The results further validate the
effectiveness and stability of the proposed method across tasks such as entity
recognition, question answering, and language generation. Experimental findings
show that the proposed structure-aware fine-tuning framework significantly
enhances the model's ability to represent complex semantic units. It
demonstrates better semantic consistency and contextual logic modeling in
scenarios involving structural reasoning and entity extraction.

Abstract: We introduce Nemotron-Nano-9B-v2, a hybrid Mamba-Transformer language model
designed to increase throughput for reasoning workloads while achieving
state-of-the-art accuracy compared to similarly-sized models.
Nemotron-Nano-9B-v2 builds on the Nemotron-H architecture, in which the
majority of the self-attention layers in the common Transformer architecture
are replaced with Mamba-2 layers, to achieve improved inference speed when
generating the long thinking traces needed for reasoning. We create
Nemotron-Nano-9B-v2 by first pre-training a 12-billion-parameter model

After aligning Nemotron-Nano-12B-v2-Base, we employ the Minitron strategy to
compress and distill the model with the goal of enabling inference on up to
128k tokens on a single NVIDIA A10G GPU (22GiB of memory, bfloat16 precision).
Compared to existing similarly-sized models (e.g., Qwen3-8B), we show that
Nemotron-Nano-9B-v2 achieves on-par or better accuracy on reasoning benchmarks
while achieving up to 6x higher inference throughput in reasoning settings like
8k input and 16k output tokens. We are releasing Nemotron-Nano-9B-v2,

Motivation: 当前Transformer模型虽然能够进行简单的规则链式推理，但在解释性和扩展性方面存在局限，无法支持溯因推理或矛盾识别等任务。

Method: 提出Representation of the Logical Structure (RLS)作为中间表示，捕捉自然语言论证中的逻辑原子和推理规则，使推理过程变得确定性和可计算。

Conclusion: RLS表示方法有效解决了当前推理模型的局限性，支持任意深度的推理、实时错误修正和交互式讨论，为自然语言论证的逻辑理解提供了新途径。

Abstract: Convincing someone of the truth value of a premise requires understanding and
articulating the core logical structure of the argument which proves or
disproves the premise. Understanding the logical structure of an argument
refers to understanding the underlying "reasons" which make up the proof or
disproof of the premise - as a function of the "logical atoms" in the argument.
While it has been shown that transformers can "chain" rules to derive simple
arguments, the challenge of articulating the "reasons" remains. Not only do
current approaches to chaining rules suffer in terms of their interpretability,
they are also quite constrained in their ability to accommodate extensions to
theoretically equivalent reasoning tasks - a model trained to chain rules
cannot support abduction or identify contradictions. In this work we suggest
addressing these shortcomings by identifying an intermediate representation
(which we call the Representation of the Logical Structure (RLS) of the
argument) that possesses an understanding of the logical structure of a natural
language argument - the logical atoms in the argument and the rules
incorporating them. Given the logical structure, reasoning is deterministic and
easy to compute. Therefore, our approach supports all forms of reasoning that
depend on the logical structure of the natural language argument, including
arbitrary depths of reasoning, on-the-fly mistake rectification and interactive
discussion with respect to an argument. We show that we can identify and
extract the logical structure of natural language arguments in three popular
reasoning datasets with high accuracies, thus supporting explanation generation
and extending the reasoning capabilities significantly.

Conclusion: EmoTale数据集为丹麦语情感语音研究提供了有价值的资源，证明了自监督学习特征在情感识别任务中的优越性，为小语种情感语音分析奠定了基础。

Abstract: While multiple emotional speech corpora exist for commonly spoken languages,
there is a lack of functional datasets for smaller (spoken) languages, such as
Danish. To our knowledge, Danish Emotional Speech (DES), published in 1997, is
the only other database of Danish emotional speech. We present EmoTale; a
corpus comprising Danish and English speech recordings with their associated
enacted emotion annotations. We demonstrate the validity of the dataset by
investigating and presenting its predictive power using speech emotion
recognition (SER) models. We develop SER models for EmoTale and the reference
datasets using self-supervised speech model (SSLM) embeddings and the openSMILE
feature extractor. We find the embeddings superior to the hand-crafted
features. The best model achieves an unweighted average recall (UAR) of 64.1%
on the EmoTale corpus using leave-one-speaker-out cross-validation, comparable
to the performance on DES.

Motivation: 解决神经手语生成中由于手语者形态和风格多样性导致的高类内变异性问题，提高模型对这些变化的鲁棒性。

Method: 1. 使用四元数空间中的骨骼旋转编码姿势，并采用测地线损失来改善关节角度运动的准确性；2. 引入对比损失，基于语义相似性（词汇重叠或SBERT句子相似性）来结构化解码器嵌入，过滤掉不传达相关语义信息的解剖和风格特征。

Result: 在Phoenix14T数据集上，仅使用对比损失就比PT基线在正确关键点概率上提高了16%；结合四元数姿势编码后，平均骨骼角度误差减少了6%。

Conclusion: 将骨骼结构建模和语义引导的对比目标整合到基于Transformer的手语生成模型训练中具有显著益处。

Abstract: One of the main challenges in neural sign language production (SLP) lies in
the high intra-class variability of signs, arising from signer morphology and
stylistic variety in the training data. To improve robustness to such
variations, we propose two enhancements to the standard Progressive
Transformers (PT) architecture (Saunders et al., 2020). First, we encode poses
using bone rotations in quaternion space and train with a geodesic loss to
improve the accuracy and clarity of angular joint movements. Second, we
introduce a contrastive loss to structure decoder embeddings by semantic
similarity, using either gloss overlap or SBERT-based sentence similarity,
aiming to filter out anatomical and stylistic features that do not convey
relevant semantic information. On the Phoenix14T dataset, the contrastive loss
alone yields a 16% improvement in Probability of Correct Keypoint over the PT
baseline. When combined with quaternion-based pose encoding, the model achieves
a 6% reduction in Mean Bone Angle Error. These results point to the benefit of
incorporating skeletal structure modeling and semantically guided contrastive
objectives on sign pose representations into the training of Transformer-based
SLP models.

Abstract: Southern Uzbek (uzs) is a Turkic language variety spoken by around 5 million
people in Afghanistan and differs significantly from Northern Uzbek (uzn) in
phonology, lexicon, and orthography. Despite the large number of speakers,
Southern Uzbek is underrepresented in natural language processing. We present
new resources for Southern Uzbek machine translation, including a 997-sentence
FLORES+ dev set, 39,994 parallel sentences from dictionary, literary, and web
sources, and a fine-tuned NLLB-200 model (lutfiy). We also propose a
post-processing method for restoring Arabic-script half-space characters, which
improves handling of morphological boundaries. All datasets, models, and tools
are released publicly to support future work on Southern Uzbek and other
low-resource languages.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出基于概念向量投影的连续情感评分方法，用于文学文本情感分析，在多语言文学数据上训练，能更好地捕捉跨体裁、语言和历史时期的细腻情感表达。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统词典工具在文学文本情感分析中表现不佳，特别是对低资源语言；而transformer模型通常输出粗粒度的分类标签，限制了细粒度分析。文学文本具有比喻语言、风格模糊性和情感唤起策略等独特挑战。

Method: 基于概念向量投影的连续情感评分方法，在多语言文学数据上进行训练，通过向量投影技术生成连续的情感分数而非分类标签。

Result: 在英语和丹麦语文本上优于现有工具，生成的情感分数分布与人类评分高度匹配，能够实现更准确的文学情感分析和情感弧建模。

Conclusion: 该方法为文学文本情感分析提供了更有效的解决方案，特别适合处理跨语言、跨体裁和历史时期的细腻情感表达需求。

Abstract: Sentiment Analysis is widely used to quantify sentiment in text, but its
application to literary texts poses unique challenges due to figurative
language, stylistic ambiguity, as well as sentiment evocation strategies.
Traditional dictionary-based tools often underperform, especially for
low-resource languages, and transformer models, while promising, typically
output coarse categorical labels that limit fine-grained analysis. We introduce
a novel continuous sentiment scoring method based on concept vector projection,
trained on multilingual literary data, which more effectively captures nuanced
sentiment expressions across genres, languages, and historical periods. Our
approach outperforms existing tools on English and Danish texts, producing
sentiment scores whose distribution closely matches human ratings, enabling
more accurate analysis and sentiment arc modeling in literature.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为scaled signed averaging (SSA)的新评分函数来替代Softmax，解决了LLM在上下文学习中处理一阶量词和线性函数时的局限性，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在类比学习（上下文学习）方面表现出色，但近期研究发现其在处理一阶量词（如all、some）和线性函数的上下文学习时存在局限性，Softmax评分函数被认为是导致这些限制的因素之一。

Method: 提出了scaled signed averaging (SSA)作为Softmax的替代方案，并在编码器-仅和解码器-仅的transformer模型上进行了评估。

Result: 实证结果显示SSA在目标任务上显著提高了性能，基于SSA的模型在各种语言探测任务上的表现达到或超过了基于Softmax的对应模型。

Conclusion: SSA作为一种新的评分函数，有效解决了Softmax在特定上下文学习任务中的局限性，为改进语言模型的类比学习能力提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit a remarkable capacity to learn by
analogy, known as in-context learning (ICL). However, recent studies have
revealed limitations in this ability. In this paper, we examine these
limitations on tasks involving first-order quantifiers such as {\em all} and
{\em some}, as well as on ICL with linear functions. We identify Softmax, the
scoring function in attention mechanism, as a contributing factor to these
constraints. To address this, we propose \textbf{scaled signed averaging
(SSA)}, a novel alternative to Softmax. Empirical results show that SSA
dramatically improves performance on our target tasks. Furthermore, we evaluate
both encoder-only and decoder-only transformers models with SSA, demonstrating
that they match or exceed their Softmax-based counterparts across a variety of
linguistic probing tasks.

TL;DR: 本文建立了严格的文本食谱生成基准，通过定制化分词策略（添加分数标记和结构标记）显著提升了GPT-2大模型在食谱生成任务上的性能，相比传统循环神经网络基线在BERTScore上获得了20%以上的相对提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决通用分词器在食谱生成任务中无法保持精确数值量和结构信息的局限性，提升领域特定的食谱生成质量。

Method: 使用RecipeDB的5种菜系语料，对比微调的GPT-2大模型(774M)与小模型(124M)以及传统LSTM/RNN基线。关键贡献是定制化分词策略，添加23个常见分数标记和自定义结构标记。

Result: 大型基于Transformer的方法相比最佳循环基线在BERTScore(F1)上获得>20%相对提升(0.92 vs 0.72)，困惑度降低69.8%。在流畅性、连贯性、语义相关性和多样性等7个自动指标上全面评估。

Conclusion: 该研究为整合现实约束和多模态输入的先进食谱生成研究奠定了基础，但仍需解决事实准确性等挑战。

Abstract: We established a rigorous benchmark for text-based recipe generation, a
fundamental task in natural language generation. We present a comprehensive
comparative study contrasting a fine-tuned GPT-2 large (774M) model against the
GPT-2 small (124M) model and traditional LSTM/RNN baselines on the 5-cuisine
corpus from RecipeDB. Our key contribution is a targeted tokenization strategy
that augments the vocabulary with 23 common fraction tokens and custom
structural markers. This approach addresses a critical limitation of generic
tokenizers by preserving essential recipe structures and precise numerical
quantities, thereby enhancing domain specificity. Performance is evaluated
using a comprehensive suite of seven automatic metrics spanning fluency
(BLEU-4, METEOR), coherence (ROUGE-L), semantic relevance (BERTScore), and
diversity. Our experiments show that the large transformer-based approach
yields a >20% relative improvement in BERTScore (F1) (0.92 vs 0.72) over the
best recurrent baseline, while reducing perplexity by 69.8%. We conclude with a
discussion of remaining challenges, particularly regarding factual accuracy,
and outline how this foundational study paves the way for integrating
real-world constraints and multi-modal inputs in advanced recipe generation
research.

*Guangzhan Wang,Hongyu Zhang,Beijun Shen,Xiaodong Gu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LMTransplant是一种新的文本增强方法，通过LLM的上下文扩展和再生机制，生成比传统方法更多样化和创造性的文本变体，在多个任务中表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统数据增强方法主要关注词汇层面的改写，语义变化有限。LLM虽然具有知识涌现能力，但输出风格和结构控制困难，需要复杂的提示工程。

Method: 提出transplant-then-regenerate范式：将种子文本嵌入到LLM扩展的上下文中，然后让LLM基于扩展上下文重新生成变体，充分利用LLM的嵌入知识。

Result: 在多个文本相关任务中评估显示，LMTransplant性能优于现有文本增强方法，并且随着增强数据量的增加展现出卓越的可扩展性。

Conclusion: LMTransplant通过创新的移植-再生策略，能够生成更多样化和创造性的内容级变体，同时保留原始文本的核心属性，为文本数据增强提供了有效的新范式。

Abstract: Data augmentation is a critical technique in deep learning. Traditional
methods like Back-translation typically focus on lexical-level rephrasing,
which primarily produces variations with the same semantics. While large
language models (LLMs) have enhanced text augmentation by their "knowledge
emergence" capability, controlling the style and structure of these outputs
remains challenging and requires meticulous prompt engineering. In this paper,
we propose LMTransplant, a novel text augmentation paradigm leveraging LLMs.
The core idea of LMTransplant is transplant-then-regenerate: incorporating seed
text into a context expanded by LLM, and asking the LLM to regenerate a variant
based on the expanded context. This strategy allows the model to create more
diverse and creative content-level variants by fully leveraging the knowledge
embedded in LLMs, while preserving the core attributes of the original text. We
evaluate LMTransplant across various text-related tasks, demonstrating its
superior performance over existing text augmentation methods. Moreover,
LMTransplant demonstrates exceptional scalability as the size of augmented data
grows.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种多语言自然语言推理评估框架，通过生成逻辑基础的合成语料来测试LLM在单语言和混合语言条件下的一致性。意外发现代码切换不仅没有降低性能，还能提升表现，显示了多语言健壮性的潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估大语言模型在多语言环境中的一致性和逻辑基础对齐能力，因为当前这个领域仍然很少被深入探索。

Method: 开发了一种受控的多语言NLI评估框架，通过生成合成的逻辑基础前提-假设对，并将其翻译成语言类型学多样的语言。这个设计允许精确控制语义关系，并在单语言和混合语言条件下进行测试。

Result: 代码切换不仅没有降低性能，还能提升表现，这表明翻译引发的词汇变异可能作为正则化信号。通过嵌入基于相似性分析和跨语言对齐可视化验证了语义保持的保真性。

Conclusion: 研究结果曝露了当前LLM跨语言推理的潜力和脆弱性，并确认代码切换作为改善多语言健壮性的有前景巧扣。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied in multilingual
contexts, yet their capacity for consistent, logically grounded alignment
across languages remains underexplored. We present a controlled evaluation
framework for multilingual natural language inference (NLI) that generates
synthetic, logic-based premise-hypothesis pairs and translates them into a
typologically diverse set of languages. This design enables precise control
over semantic relations and allows testing in both monolingual and
mixed-language (code-switched) conditions. Surprisingly, code-switching does
not degrade, and can even improve, performance, suggesting that
translation-induced lexical variation may serve as a regularization signal. We
validate semantic preservation through embedding-based similarity analyses and
cross-lingual alignment visualizations, confirming the fidelity of translated
pairs. Our findings expose both the potential and the brittleness of current
LLM cross-lingual reasoning, and identify code-switching as a promising lever
for improving multilingual robustness. Code available at:

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TransLLM是一个统一的基础框架，通过可学习的提示组合将时空建模与大型语言模型集成，解决了传统小模型任务特定性和大语言模型在时空数据处理方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法存在两个关键限制：小规模深度学习模型任务特定且数据饥渴，限制了跨场景的泛化能力；而大型语言模型虽然通过自然语言接口提供灵活性，但在结构化时空数据和交通领域的数值推理方面表现不佳。

Method: 采用轻量级时空编码器（扩张时间卷积和双邻接图注意力网络）捕获复杂依赖关系，通过结构化嵌入与LLMs无缝接口。新颖的实例级提示路由机制通过强化学习训练，基于输入特征动态个性化提示。

Result: 在7个数据集和3个任务上的实验表明，TransLLM在监督和零样本设置中都表现出卓越效果，相比10个基线模型，在回归和规划问题上都展现出竞争性性能和强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: TransLLM框架成功整合了时空建模与大型语言模型，通过动态个性化提示机制实现了跨任务的强适应性和泛化能力，为城市交通系统的多任务处理提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Urban transportation systems encounter diverse challenges across multiple
tasks, such as traffic forecasting, electric vehicle (EV) charging demand
prediction, and taxi dispatch. Existing approaches suffer from two key
limitations: small-scale deep learning models are task-specific and
data-hungry, limiting their generalizability across diverse scenarios, while
large language models (LLMs), despite offering flexibility through natural
language interfaces, struggle with structured spatiotemporal data and numerical
reasoning in transportation domains. To address these limitations, we propose
TransLLM, a unified foundation framework that integrates spatiotemporal
modeling with large language models through learnable prompt composition. Our
approach features a lightweight spatiotemporal encoder that captures complex
dependencies via dilated temporal convolutions and dual-adjacency graph
attention networks, seamlessly interfacing with LLMs through structured
embeddings. A novel instance-level prompt routing mechanism, trained via
reinforcement learning, dynamically personalizes prompts based on input
characteristics, moving beyond fixed task-specific templates. The framework
operates by encoding spatiotemporal patterns into contextual representations,
dynamically composing personalized prompts to guide LLM reasoning, and
projecting the resulting representations through specialized output layers to
generate task-specific predictions. Experiments across seven datasets and three
tasks demonstrate the exceptional effectiveness of TransLLM in both supervised
and zero-shot settings. Compared to ten baseline models, it delivers
competitive performance on both regression and planning problems, showing
strong generalization and cross-task adaptability. Our code is available at

TL;DR: 这篇论文研究了采用检索增强生成(RAG)技术来处理超长的电子健康记录(EHR)，通过检索相关文本来提高临床任务的性能和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电子健康记录长度过长、噪音多且重复，超出了现有大语言模型的上下文窗口限制，需要有效的解决方案来提取和处理这些非结构化文本。

Method: 设计了三个可在不同健康系统中复现的临床任务：提取影像检查项目、生成抗生素使用时间线、识别关键诊断。使用真实患者的EHR数据，测试了三种先进的LLM模型，比较了目标文本检索和最近临床记录两种方法的效果。

Result: 发现RAG方法的性能接近或超过了使用最近记录的方法，并接近了使用模型全部上下文的性能水平，同时需要的输入token数量显著减少。

Conclusion: 证明了RAG技术在处理长文本临床记录时仍然是一种具有竞争力和高效率的方法，即使新模型能够处理更长的文本也如此。

Abstract: Electronic health records (EHRs) are long, noisy, and often redundant, posing
a major challenge for the clinicians who must navigate them. Large language
models (LLMs) offer a promising solution for extracting and reasoning over this
unstructured text, but the length of clinical notes often exceeds even
state-of-the-art models' extended context windows. Retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG) offers an alternative by retrieving task-relevant passages
from across the entire EHR, potentially reducing the amount of required input
tokens. In this work, we propose three clinical tasks designed to be replicable
across health systems with minimal effort: 1) extracting imaging procedures, 2)
generating timelines of antibiotic use, and 3) identifying key diagnoses. Using
EHRs from actual hospitalized patients, we test three state-of-the-art LLMs
with varying amounts of provided context, using either targeted text retrieval
or the most recent clinical notes. We find that RAG closely matches or exceeds
the performance of using recent notes, and approaches the performance of using
the models' full context while requiring drastically fewer input tokens. Our
results suggest that RAG remains a competitive and efficient approach even as
newer models become capable of handling increasingly longer amounts of text.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型语言模型的推理过程主要基于英语，缺乏对其他语言推理能力的系统研究。本研究旨在探索长链思维推理在不同语言间的迁移效果，促进公平的多语言推理研究。

Method: 构建了两个流行英语推理数据集的翻译版本，在Qwen 2.5 (7B)和Qwen 3 (8B)模型上进行微调，系统研究了法语、日语、拉脱维亚语和斯瓦希里语的长链思维生成。

Result: 1) 英语作为枢纽语言的效果因语言而异：对法语无益，对日语和拉脱维亚语有改善，对斯瓦希里语效果不足；2) 多语言预训练能缩小但无法消除跨语言性能差距；3) 数据质量与规模的权衡具有语言依赖性。

Conclusion: 研究阐明了长链思维推理何时以及为何能在语言间迁移，提供了翻译数据集以促进公平的多语言推理研究，轻量级微调能显著改善低资源语言的推理性能。

Abstract: Scaling inference through long chains-of-thought (CoTs) has unlocked
impressive reasoning capabilities in large language models (LLMs), yet the
reasoning process remains almost exclusively English-centric. We construct
translated versions of two popular English reasoning datasets, fine-tune Qwen
2.5 (7B) and Qwen 3 (8B) models, and present a systematic study of long CoT
generation across French, Japanese, Latvian, and Swahili. Our experiments
reveal three key findings. First, the efficacy of using English as a pivot
language varies by language: it provides no benefit for French, improves
performance when used as the reasoning language for Japanese and Latvian, and
proves insufficient for Swahili where both task comprehension and reasoning
remain poor. Second, extensive multilingual pretraining in Qwen 3 narrows but
does not eliminate the cross-lingual performance gap. A lightweight fine-tune
using only 1k traces still improves performance by over 30\% in Swahili. Third,
data quality versus scale trade-offs are language dependent: small, carefully
curated datasets suffice for English and French, whereas larger but noisier
corpora prove more effective for Swahili and Latvian. Together, these results
clarify when and why long CoTs transfer across languages and provide translated
datasets to foster equitable multilingual reasoning research.

Abstract: Recent developments in Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents have shown
impressive capabilities spanning multiple domains, exemplified by deep research
systems that demonstrate superior performance on complex information-seeking
and synthesis tasks. While general-purpose deep research agents have shown
impressive capabilities, they struggle significantly with medical domain
challenges, as evidenced by leading proprietary systems achieving limited
accuracy on complex medical benchmarks. The key limitations are: (1) the model
lacks sufficient dense medical knowledge for clinical reasoning, and (2) the
framework is constrained by the absence of specialized retrieval tools tailored
for medical contexts.We present a medical deep research agent that addresses
these challenges through two core innovations. First, we develop a novel data
synthesis framework using medical knowledge graphs, extracting the longest
chains from subgraphs around rare medical entities to generate complex
multi-hop question-answer pairs. Second, we integrate a custom-built private
medical retrieval engine alongside general-purpose tools, enabling accurate
medical information synthesis. Our approach generates 2100+ diverse
trajectories across 12 medical specialties, each averaging 4.2 tool
interactions.Through a two-stage training paradigm combining supervised
fine-tuning and online reinforcement learning with composite rewards, our
MedResearcher-R1-32B model demonstrates exceptional performance, establishing
new state-of-the-art results on medical benchmarks while maintaining
competitive performance on general deep research tasks. Our work demonstrates
that strategic domain-specific innovations in architecture, tool design, and
training data construction can enable smaller open-source models to outperform
much larger proprietary systems in specialized domains.

Motivation: 扩散大语言模型在边缘设备部署面临参数规模大和资源需求高的挑战，而现有的后训练量化技术主要针对自回归模型，对扩散模型的研究尚属空白。

Method: 识别激活异常值问题，实现最先进的后训练量化方法，并从比特宽度、量化方法、任务类别和模型类型四个维度进行综合评估。

Result: 发现激活异常值主导动态范围，严重影响低比特量化精度，通过多角度评估揭示了不同配置下dLLMs的量化行为特征。

Conclusion: 研究结果为未来高效dLLM部署提供了基础，所有代码和实验设置将开源以支持社区发展。

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion large language models (dLLMs) have introduced a
promising alternative to autoregressive (AR) LLMs for natural language
generation tasks, leveraging full attention and denoising-based decoding
strategies. However, the deployment of these models on edge devices remains
challenging due to their massive parameter scale and high resource demands.
While post-training quantization (PTQ) has emerged as a widely adopted
technique for compressing AR LLMs, its applicability to dLLMs remains largely
unexplored. In this work, we present the first systematic study on quantizing
diffusion-based language models. We begin by identifying the presence of
activation outliers, characterized by abnormally large activation values that
dominate the dynamic range. These outliers pose a key challenge to low-bit
quantization, as they make it difficult to preserve precision for the majority
of values. More importantly, we implement state-of-the-art PTQ methods and
conduct a comprehensive evaluation across multiple task types and model
variants. Our analysis is structured along four key dimensions: bit-width,
quantization method, task category, and model type. Through this
multi-perspective evaluation, we offer practical insights into the quantization
behavior of dLLMs under different configurations. We hope our findings provide
a foundation for future research in efficient dLLM deployment. All codes and
experimental setups will be released to support the community.

TL;DR: FakeHunter是一个多模态深度伪造检测框架，结合记忆引导检索、思维链推理和工具增强验证，在X-AVFake基准测试上达到34.75%的准确率，比基线模型提升显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的深度伪造检测方法缺乏可解释性和准确性，需要开发一个能够提供结构化解释并利用多模态信息进行验证的系统。

Method: 使用CLIP编码视觉内容、CLAP编码音频，生成联合音视频嵌入，从FAISS索引的记忆库中检索相似真实样本进行上下文锚定。采用观察-思考-行动的思维链推理，并在置信度低时自动调用专业工具进行细粒度验证。

Result: 在X-AVFake基准测试（5.7k+视频）上达到34.75%准确率，比Qwen2.5-Omni-7B提升16.87个百分点，比MiniCPM-2.6提升25.56个百分点。记忆检索贡献7.75个百分点增益，工具检查将低置信度案例提升至46.50%。

Conclusion: FakeHunter通过多阶段设计实现了准确且可解释的深度伪造检测，证明了记忆检索和工具增强验证的有效性，具备实际部署可行性。

Abstract: FakeHunter is a multimodal deepfake detection framework that combines
memory-guided retrieval, chain-of-thought (Observation-Thought-Action)
reasoning, and tool-augmented verification to provide accurate and
interpretable video forensics. FakeHunter encodes visual content using CLIP and
audio using CLAP, generating joint audio-visual embeddings that retrieve
semantically similar real exemplars from a FAISS-indexed memory bank for
contextual grounding. Guided by the retrieved context, the system iteratively
reasons over evidence to localize manipulations and explain them. When
confidence is low, it automatically invokes specialized tools-such as zoom-in
image forensics or mel-spectrogram inspection-for fine-grained verification.
Built on Qwen2.5-Omni-7B, FakeHunter produces structured JSON verdicts that
specify what was modified, where it occurs, and why it is judged fake. We also
introduce X-AVFake, a benchmark comprising 5.7k+ manipulated and real videos
(950+ min) annotated with manipulation type, region/entity, violated reasoning
category, and free-form justification. On X-AVFake, FakeHunter achieves an
accuracy of 34.75%, outperforming the vanilla Qwen2.5-Omni-7B by 16.87
percentage points and MiniCPM-2.6 by 25.56 percentage points. Ablation studies
reveal that memory retrieval contributes a 7.75 percentage point gain, and
tool-based inspection improves low-confidence cases to 46.50%. Despite its
multi-stage design, the pipeline processes a 10-minute clip in 8 minutes on a
single NVIDIA A800 (0.8x real-time) or 2 minutes on four GPUs (0.2x),
demonstrating practical deployability.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本研究通过比较大型语言模型（LLM）与人类在情感刺激评价任务中的表现，发现GPT-4o在多数情感维度上与人类高度相似，但在唤醒度维度上差异较大，且LLM评分比人类更加同质化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM在日常生活中的应用日益广泛，需要了解这些模型如何评估情感刺激，以及它们与人类情感认知的匹配程度，这关系到LLM作为人类代理或交互伙伴的有效性。

Method: 使用先前由人类评定的情感词汇和图像数据集，让多个主流LLM执行相同的评分任务，比较LLM与人类在情感维度（五类情绪和二维情感空间）上的评分一致性。

Result: GPT-4o在多数评分维度上与人类高度相关（r ≥ 0.9），但唤醒度评分一致性较差，快乐评分一致性最高。LLM在五类情绪框架中的表现优于二维情感空间组织，且LLM评分比人类更加同质化。

Conclusion: LLM在情感刺激解释方面与人类存在显著相似性和差异，这些发现有助于理解人工智能与生物智能在关键行为领域的异同，为LLM在情感相关应用中的部署提供参考。

Abstract: Emotions exert an immense influence over human behavior and cognition in both
commonplace and high-stress tasks. Discussions of whether or how to integrate
large language models (LLMs) into everyday life (e.g., acting as proxies for,
or interacting with, human agents), should be informed by an understanding of
how these tools evaluate emotionally loaded stimuli or situations. A model's
alignment with human behavior in these cases can inform the effectiveness of
LLMs for certain roles or interactions. To help build this understanding, we
elicited ratings from multiple popular LLMs for datasets of words and images
that were previously rated for their emotional content by humans. We found that
when performing the same rating tasks, GPT-4o responded very similarly to human
participants across modalities, stimuli and most rating scales (r = 0.9 or
higher in many cases). However, arousal ratings were less well aligned between
human and LLM raters, while happiness ratings were most highly aligned. Overall
LLMs aligned better within a five-category (happiness, anger, sadness, fear,
disgust) emotion framework than within a two-dimensional (arousal and valence)
organization. Finally, LLM ratings were substantially more homogenous than
human ratings. Together these results begin to describe how LLM agents
interpret emotional stimuli and highlight similarities and differences among
biological and artificial intelligence in key behavioral domains.

Abstract: We propose a neurosymbolic approach to the explanation of complex sequences
of decisions that combines the strengths of decision procedures and Large
Language Models (LLMs). We demonstrate this approach by producing explanations
for the solutions of Hitori puzzles. The rules of Hitori include local
constraints that are effectively explained by short resolution proofs. However,
they also include a connectivity constraint that is more suitable for visual
explanations. Hence, Hitori provides an excellent testing ground for a flexible
combination of SAT solvers and LLMs. We have implemented a tool that assists
humans in solving Hitori puzzles, and we present experimental evidence of its
effectiveness.

TL;DR: 本文提出了ORThought框架，通过思维链推理利用专家级优化建模原则来自动化优化建模过程，解决了现有LLM方法在基准标注错误率高、评估范围窄和计算效率低的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 优化建模过程耗时且容易出错，严重依赖领域专家。虽然大语言模型在自然语言理解和推理方面显示出潜力，但现有方法存在基准标注错误率高（达42%）、评估范围窄（仅考虑最优值）以及计算效率低（依赖多智能体系统或模型微调）等局限性。

Method: 首先通过系统错误校正和更全面的标注增强现有数据集；引入LogiOR物流领域的新优化建模基准；提出ORThought框架，通过思维链推理利用专家级优化建模原则来自动化优化建模过程。

Result: 通过广泛的实证评估，ORThought在复杂优化问题上表现出显著优势，优于包括多智能体框架在内的现有方法。

Conclusion: 提供了方法的系统分析，识别了关键成功因素和失败模式，为基于LLM的优化建模未来研究提供了宝贵见解。

Abstract: Optimization Modeling (OM) is essential for solving complex decision-making
problems. However, the process remains time-consuming and error-prone, heavily
relying on domain experts. While Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise in
addressing these challenges through their natural language understanding and
reasoning capabilities, current approaches face three critical limitations:
high benchmark labeling error rates reaching up to 42\%, narrow evaluation
scope that only considers optimal values, and computational inefficiency due to
heavy reliance on multi-agent systems or model fine-tuning. In this work, we
first enhance existing datasets through systematic error correction and more
comprehensive annotation. Additionally, we introduce LogiOR, a new optimization
modeling benchmark from the logistics domain, containing more complex problems
with standardized annotations. Furthermore, we present ORThought, a novel
framework that leverages expert-level optimization modeling principles through
chain-of-thought reasoning to automate the OM process. Through extensive
empirical evaluation, we demonstrate that ORThought outperforms existing
approaches, including multi-agent frameworks, with particularly significant
advantages on complex optimization problems. Finally, we provide a systematic
analysis of our method, identifying critical success factors and failure modes,
providing valuable insights for future research on LLM-based optimization
modeling.

Motivation: AI代理在网络环境中越来越像人类行为，导致信任、责任、伦理和安全等方面的挑战，需要系统性的行为分析和监管框架。

Method: 提出网络行为生命周期模型（6阶段分析）、A4A范式和HABD模型（5维度：决策机制、执行效率、意图-行为一致性、行为惯性和非理性模式），并通过红蓝队攻防实战验证。

Result: 模型有效区分了人类和代理的行为差异，为安全可信的人机协作提供了理论基础，验证了在真实网络攻防场景中的实用性。

Conclusion: 未来研究方向包括动态认知治理架构、行为差异量化和元治理协议栈，旨在建立安全可信的人机协作技术路线图。

Abstract: Advancements in AI have led to agents in networked environments increasingly
mirroring human behavior, thereby blurring the boundary between artificial and
human actors in specific contexts. This shift brings about significant
challenges in trust, responsibility, ethics, security and etc. The difficulty
in supervising of agent behaviors may lead to issues such as data contamination
and unclear accountability. To address these challenges, this paper proposes
the "Network Behavior Lifecycle" model, which divides network behavior into 6
stages and systematically analyzes the behavioral differences between humans
and agents at each stage. Based on these insights, the paper further introduces
the "Agent for Agent (A4A)" paradigm and the "Human-Agent Behavioral Disparity
(HABD)" model, which examine the fundamental distinctions between human and
agent behaviors across 5 dimensions: decision mechanism, execution efficiency,
intention-behavior consistency, behavioral inertia, and irrational patterns.
The effectiveness of the model is verified through real-world cases such as red
team penetration and blue team defense. Finally, the paper discusses future
research directions in dynamic cognitive governance architecture, behavioral
disparity quantification, and meta-governance protocol stacks, aiming to
provide a theoretical foundation and technical roadmap for secure and
trustworthy human-agent collaboration.

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了使用规划器生成的转换解决方案图的结构化示例来提升基于LLM的智能体在视角采择任务中的表现，但发现仅靠结构化示例不足以实现稳健的视角采择能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在需要主动感知、协作推理和视角采择的任务中仍面临挑战，研究旨在通过结构化示例改进LLM智能体在ReAct框架中的表现。

Method: 提出结构化解决方案处理管道，生成三种类型的示例（G型、E型、L型），并通过LLM将其转换为"思考-行动"示例，在ReAct框架中测试智能体性能。

Result: L型示例略微减少了澄清请求和总体行动步骤，但未带来一致改进。智能体在基础注意力过滤任务中成功，但在需要心理化遮挡空间或权衡认知行动成本的场景中表现不佳。

Conclusion: 仅靠结构化示例不足以实现稳健的视角采择，需要明确的信念追踪、成本建模和更丰富的环境来支持基于LLM的智能体进行社会性协作。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and reasoning frameworks have
opened new possibilities for improving the perspective -taking capabilities of
autonomous agents. However, tasks that involve active perception, collaborative
reasoning, and perspective taking (understanding what another agent can see or
knows) pose persistent challenges for current LLM-based systems. This study
investigates the potential of structured examples derived from transformed
solution graphs generated by the Fast Downward planner to improve the
performance of LLM-based agents within a ReAct framework. We propose a
structured solution-processing pipeline that generates three distinct
categories of examples: optimal goal paths (G-type), informative node paths
(E-type), and step-by-step optimal decision sequences contrasting alternative
actions (L-type). These solutions are further converted into ``thought-action''
examples by prompting an LLM to explicitly articulate the reasoning behind each
decision. While L-type examples slightly reduce clarification requests and
overall action steps, they do not yield consistent improvements. Agents are
successful in tasks requiring basic attentional filtering but struggle in
scenarios that required mentalising about occluded spaces or weighing the costs
of epistemic actions. These findings suggest that structured examples alone are
insufficient for robust perspective-taking, underscoring the need for explicit
belief tracking, cost modelling, and richer environments to enable socially
grounded collaboration in LLM-based agents.

Method: 在Lean 4定理证明器中构建综合几何定理库，与Mathlib无缝集成，并创建包含IMO等高级几何问题的LeanGeo-Bench基准测试

Result: 评估了最先进大语言模型在该基准上的表现，展示了自动几何推理的能力和局限性

Conclusion: 几何问题需要进一步的技术进步，开源了定理库和基准测试以促进几何推理研究

Abstract: Geometry problems are a crucial testbed for AI reasoning capabilities. Most
existing geometry solving systems cannot express problems within a unified
framework, thus are difficult to integrate with other mathematical fields.
Besides, since most geometric proofs rely on intuitive diagrams, verifying
geometry problems is particularly challenging. To address these gaps, we
introduce LeanGeo, a unified formal system for formalizing and solving
competition-level geometry problems within the Lean 4 theorem prover. LeanGeo
features a comprehensive library of high-level geometric theorems with Lean's
foundational logic, enabling rigorous proof verification and seamless
integration with Mathlib. We also present LeanGeo-Bench, a formal geometry
benchmark in LeanGeo, comprising problems from the International Mathematical
Olympiad (IMO) and other advanced sources. Our evaluation demonstrates the
capabilities and limitations of state-of-the-art Large Language Models on this
benchmark, highlighting the need for further advancements in automated
geometric reasoning. We open source the theorem library and the benchmark of
LeanGeo at https://github.com/project-numina/LeanGeo/tree/master.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 极端降雨事件频发给城市应急调度带来挑战，现有方法在目标权衡、动态环境适应和LLM策略稳定性方面存在不足，需要统一感知、全局优化和多智能体协调的框架。

Method: 提出H-J分层多智能体框架，整合知识引导提示、熵约束生成和反馈驱动优化，建立从多源感知到策略执行和持续优化的闭环流程。

Result: 在真实城市拓扑和降雨数据上的实验表明，H-J在极端降雨、间歇性暴雨和日常小雨三种条件下，在交通流畅度、任务成功率和系统鲁棒性方面均优于基于规则和强化学习的基线方法。

Conclusion: 基于LLM的不确定性感知和知识约束方法有望增强城市洪水响应的韧性，H-J框架为解决复杂环境下的应急调度问题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: In recent years, the increasing frequency of extreme urban rainfall events
has posed significant challenges to emergency scheduling systems. Urban
flooding often leads to severe traffic congestion and service disruptions,
threatening public safety and mobility. However, effective decision making
remains hindered by three key challenges: (1) managing trade-offs among
competing goals (e.g., traffic flow, task completion, and risk mitigation)
requires dynamic, context-aware strategies; (2) rapidly evolving environmental
conditions render static rules inadequate; and (3) LLM-generated strategies
frequently suffer from semantic instability and execution inconsistency.
Existing methods fail to align perception, global optimization, and multi-agent
coordination within a unified framework. To tackle these challenges, we
introduce H-J, a hierarchical multi-agent framework that integrates
knowledge-guided prompting, entropy-constrained generation, and feedback-driven
optimization. The framework establishes a closed-loop pipeline spanning from
multi-source perception to strategic execution and continuous refinement. We
evaluate H-J on real-world urban topology and rainfall data under three
representative conditions: extreme rainfall, intermittent bursts, and daily
light rain. Experiments show that H-J outperforms rule-based and
reinforcement-learning baselines in traffic smoothness, task success rate, and
system robustness. These findings highlight the promise of uncertainty-aware,
knowledge-constrained LLM-based approaches for enhancing resilience in urban
flood response.

TL;DR: MCP-Universe是首个专门针对MCP协议的综合基准测试，通过6个核心领域11个真实MCP服务器来评估LLM在复杂现实任务中的表现，发现即使是SOTA模型也存在显著性能限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试过于简单，无法捕捉真实应用中的挑战，如长时程推理和大规模陌生工具空间的使用。

Method: 构建包含6个核心领域11个MCP服务器的综合基准，采用执行式评估器（格式评估器、静态评估器、动态评估器）进行严格评估。

Result: 顶级模型如GPT-5(43.72%)、Grok-4(33.33%)和Claude-4.0-Sonnet(29.44%)表现不佳，面临长上下文和未知工具使用挑战。

Conclusion: MCP-Universe填补了重要空白，为MCP生态系统提供了可扩展的评估框架，促进该领域的创新发展。

Abstract: The Model Context Protocol has emerged as a transformative standard for
connecting large language models to external data sources and tools, rapidly
gaining adoption across major AI providers and development platforms. However,
existing benchmarks are overly simplistic and fail to capture real application
challenges such as long-horizon reasoning and large, unfamiliar tool spaces. To
address this critical gap, we introduce MCP-Universe, the first comprehensive
benchmark specifically designed to evaluate LLMs in realistic and hard tasks
through interaction with real-world MCP servers. Our benchmark encompasses 6
core domains spanning 11 different MCP servers: Location Navigation, Repository
Management, Financial Analysis, 3D Design, Browser Automation, and Web
Searching. To ensure rigorous evaluation, we implement execution-based
evaluators, including format evaluators for agent format compliance, static
evaluators for time-invariant content matching, and dynamic evaluators that
automatically retrieve real-time ground truth for temporally sensitive tasks.
Through extensive evaluation of leading LLMs, we find that even SOTA models
such as GPT-5 (43.72%), Grok-4 (33.33%) and Claude-4.0-Sonnet (29.44%) exhibit
significant performance limitations. In addition, our benchmark poses a
significant long-context challenge for LLM agents, as the number of input
tokens increases rapidly with the number of interaction steps. Moreover, it
introduces an unknown-tools challenge, as LLM agents often lack familiarity
with the precise usage of the MCP servers. Notably, enterprise-level agents
like Cursor cannot achieve better performance than standard ReAct frameworks.
Beyond evaluation, we open-source our extensible evaluation framework with UI
support, enabling researchers and practitioners to seamlessly integrate new
agents and MCP servers while fostering innovation in the rapidly evolving MCP
ecosystem.

Motivation: CPS系统需要强大模型进行验证和诊断，但合适模型往往难以手动提取，数据驱动方法为此提供解决方案

Method: 将CPS离散抽象为Mealy机，采用主动学习的PAC学习范式，通过引导采样收集数据来估计有限时间步长的安全概率

Result: 方法在自动车道保持系统案例中得到验证，能够提供具有置信度保证的安全概率估计

Conclusion: 该方法成功建立了离散逻辑与概率可达性分析之间的联系，为CPS系统安全验证提供了数据驱动的解决方案

Abstract: Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) are complex systems that require powerful models
for tasks like verification, diagnosis, or debugging. Often, suitable models
are not available and manual extraction is difficult. Data-driven approaches
then provide a solution to, e.g., diagnosis tasks and verification problems
based on data collected from the system. In this paper, we consider CPS with a
discrete abstraction in the form of a Mealy machine. We propose a data-driven
approach to determine the safety probability of the system on a finite horizon
of n time steps. The approach is based on the Probably Approximately Correct
(PAC) learning paradigm. Thus, we elaborate a connection between discrete logic
and probabilistic reachability analysis of systems, especially providing an
additional confidence on the determined probability. The learning process
follows an active learning paradigm, where new learning data is sampled in a
guided way after an initial learning set is collected. We validate the approach
with a case study on an automated lane-keeping system.

TL;DR: 论文探讨AI模型是否能内省，提出比现有"轻量级"定义更"厚重"的内省定义，并通过LLM温度参数推理实验证明模型可能表现出轻量级内省但缺乏真正意义的内省能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI模型是否能内省已成为重要实践问题，但缺乏对"内省"的统一定义。现有"轻量级"定义不足以准确描述AI的内省能力，需要更严格的定义标准。

Method: 提出新的内省定义：任何通过比第三方可用方法更可靠且计算成本相当或更低的过程来获取内部状态信息。通过LLM推理自身温度参数的实验来验证定义。

Result: 实验显示LLM能够表现出轻量级内省的表象，但按照作者提出的更严格定义，它们未能实现有意义的内省。

Conclusion: 需要采用更"厚重"的内省定义来准确评估AI模型的内省能力，当前LLM虽然能表现出某些内省特征，但缺乏真正的内省能力。

Abstract: Whether AI models can introspect is an increasingly important practical
question. But there is no consensus on how introspection is to be defined.
Beginning from a recently proposed ''lightweight'' definition, we argue instead
for a thicker one. According to our proposal, introspection in AI is any
process which yields information about internal states through a process more
reliable than one with equal or lower computational cost available to a third
party. Using experiments where LLMs reason about their internal temperature
parameters, we show they can appear to have lightweight introspection while
failing to meaningfully introspect per our proposed definition.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基准测试主要依赖静态检查或二进制通过/失败脚本，无法捕捉真实软件应用的交互行为和运行时动态特性，存在评估盲区。

Method: 开发了RealDevBench（194个多样化软件工程任务集）和AppEvalPilot（基于GUI的用户交互模拟评估系统），通过代理即法官的方式自动评估软件功能正确性、视觉保真度和运行时行为。

Result: 实现了0.92的准确率和0.85的人类专家评估相关性，显著减少了对人工审核的依赖。

Conclusion: 该框架能够实现可扩展的、与人类对齐的生产级软件评估，为LLMs生成的软件质量提供有效自动化评估方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) and code agents in software development are
rapidly evolving from generating isolated code snippets to producing
full-fledged software applications with graphical interfaces, interactive
logic, and dynamic behaviors. However, current benchmarks fall short in
evaluating such production-ready software, as they often rely on static checks
or binary pass/fail scripts, failing to capture the interactive behaviors and
runtime dynamics that define real-world usability - qualities that only emerge
when an application is actively used. This is the blind spot of current
evaluation: you don't know if an app works until you click through it, interact
with it, and observe how it responds. To bridge this gap, we introduce
RealDevWorld, a novel evaluation framework for automated end-to-end assessment
of LLMs' ability to generate production-ready repositories from scratch. It
features two key components: (1) RealDevBench, a diverse collection of 194
open-ended software engineering tasks across multiple domains, incorporating
multimodal elements to reflect real-world complexity; and (2) AppEvalPilot, a
new agent-as-a-judge evaluation system that simulates realistic, GUI-based user
interactions to automatically and holistically assess software functional
correctness, visual fidelity, and runtime behavior. The framework delivers
fine-grained, task-specific diagnostic feedback, supporting nuanced evaluation
beyond simple success/failure judgments. Empirical results show that
RealDevWorld delivers effective, automatic, and human-aligned evaluations,
achieving an accuracy of 0.92 and a correlation of 0.85 with expert human
assessments, while significantly reducing the reliance on manual review. This
enables scalable, human-aligned assessment of production-level software
generated by LLMs. Our code is available on GitHub.

Conclusion: 讨论了此类辅助系统对计算机科学教育的影响

Abstract: Specifications for code writing tasks are usually expressed in natural
language and may be ambiguous. Programmers must therefore develop the ability
to recognize ambiguities in task specifications and resolve them by asking
clarifying questions. We present and evaluate a prototype system, based on a
novel technique (ARHF: Ambiguity Resolution with Human Feedback), that (1)
suggests specific inputs on which a given task specification may be ambiguous,
(2) seeks limited human feedback about the code's desired behavior on those
inputs, and (3) uses this feedback to generate code that resolves these
ambiguities. We evaluate the efficacy of our prototype, and we discuss the
implications of such assistive systems on Computer Science education.

Motivation: 现有代码生成评估指标如pass@k、BLEU等需要参考代码或执行测试，无法有效衡量模型生成代码的结构稳定性

Method: 将结构熵概念扩展到程序领域，通过分析AST的深度限制子树分布，使用Jensen-Shannon散度和结构交叉熵比率两种互补指标

Result: 在标准代码生成任务上对多个主流LLM进行基准测试，证明AST驱动的结构熵能揭示模型一致性和鲁棒性的细微差别

Conclusion: 该方法时间复杂度为O(n,d)，无需外部测试，为代码生成评估工具包提供了一个轻量级补充

Abstract: Assessing the stability of code generation from large language models (LLMs)
is essential for judging their reliability in real-world development. We extend
prior "structural-entropy concepts" to the program domain by pairing entropy
with abstract syntax tree (AST) analysis. For any fixed prompt, we collect the
multiset of depth-bounded subtrees of AST in each generated program and treat
their relative frequencies as a probability distribution. We then measure
stability in two complementary ways: (i) Jensen-Shannon divergence, a
symmetric, bounded indicator of structural overlap, and (ii) a Structural
Cross-Entropy ratio that highlights missing high-probability patterns. Both
metrics admit structural-only and token-aware variants, enabling separate views
on control-flow shape and identifier-level variability. Unlike pass@k, BLEU, or
CodeBLEU, our metrics are reference-free, language-agnostic, and
execution-independent. We benchmark several leading LLMs on standard code
generation tasks, demonstrating that AST-driven structural entropy reveals
nuances in model consistency and robustness. The method runs in O(n,d) time
with no external tests, providing a lightweight addition to the code-generation
evaluation toolkit.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前代码生成基准测试主要关注功能正确性，忽视了代码质量的其他重要维度。需要系统评估LLM在多维度代码质量方面的能力，并提出改进方法。

Method: 使用PythonSecurityEval基准测试，引入基于Bandit和Pylint的迭代静态分析驱动提示算法，通过反馈循环识别和解决代码质量问题。

Result: GPT-4o在10次迭代后显著改善：安全问题从>40%降至13%，可读性违规从>80%降至11%，可靠性警告从>50%降至11%。

Conclusion: 静态分析反馈可以有效指导LLM生成更高质量的代码，超越单纯的功能正确性，在多维度代码质量方面实现显著提升。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in
code generation, achieving high scores on benchmarks such as HumanEval and
MBPP. However, these benchmarks primarily assess functional correctness and
neglect broader dimensions of code quality, including security, reliability,
readability, and maintainability. In this work, we systematically evaluate the
ability of LLMs to generate high-quality code across multiple dimensions using
the PythonSecurityEval benchmark. We introduce an iterative static
analysis-driven prompting algorithm that leverages Bandit and Pylint to
identify and resolve code quality issues. Our experiments with GPT-4o show
substantial improvements: security issues reduced from >40% to 13%, readability
violations from >80% to 11%, and reliability warnings from >50% to 11% within
ten iterations. These results demonstrate that LLMs, when guided by static
analysis feedback, can significantly enhance code quality beyond functional
correctness.

This paper presents the design, implementation, and evaluation of the AirQo

pipeline integrates diverse data streams from low-cost sensors, third-party
weather APIs, and reference-grade monitors to enable automated calibration,
forecasting, and accessible analytics. We demonstrate the pipeline's ability to
ingest, transform, and distribute millions of air quality measurements monthly

operational metrics such as resource utilization, ingestion throughput,
calibration accuracy, and data availability, offering practical insights into
building sustainable environmental data platforms. By open-sourcing the
platform and documenting deployment experiences, this work contributes a
reusable blueprint for similar initiatives seeking to advance environmental

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的软件结构模式，通过概念和同步机制来提高代码可读性和模块化，以解决LLM编程时代软件难以理解和维护的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM编程工具的发展，当前软件结构存在"不可读性"（代码与行为缺乏直接对应关系）和模块化不足的问题，无法满足增量开发、完整性和透明性这三个健壮编程的关键需求。

Method: 提出基于概念和同步的结构模式：概念是完全独立的服务，同步是基于事件的规则来协调概念间交互。使用领域特定语言来声明式表达同步行为，便于LLM生成。

Result: 通过RealWorld基准测试案例研究验证了该方法的有效性，展示了新结构模式在提高软件可读性和模块化方面的优势。

Conclusion: 新的结构模式能够更好地适应LLM编程时代的需求，通过概念和同步机制实现更清晰、更模块化的软件架构，为LLM生成代码提供了更好的基础。

Abstract: The opportunities offered by LLM coders (and their current limitations)
demand a reevaluation of how software is structured. Software today is often
"illegible" - lacking a direct correspondence between code and observed
behavior - and insufficiently modular, leading to a failure of three key
requirements of robust coding: incrementality (the ability to deliver small
increments by making localized changes), integrity (avoiding breaking prior
increments) and transparency (making clear what has changed at build time, and
what actions have happened at runtime).
  A new structural pattern offers improved legibility and modularity. Its
elements are concepts and synchronizations: fully independent services and
event-based rules that mediate between them. A domain-specific language for
synchronizations allows behavioral features to be expressed in a granular and
declarative way (and thus readily generated by an LLM). A case study of the
RealWorld benchmark is used to illustrate and evaluate the approach.

TL;DR: Preguss是一个结合静态分析和演绎验证的模块化框架，通过RTE引导的验证单元构建和LLM辅助的规范合成，实现大规模程序自动化验证


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 完全自动化验证大规模软硬件系统是形式化方法的终极目标，但现有LLM方法存在上下文长度限制和难以推断复杂过程间规范的局限性

Method: 采用模块化细粒度框架，结合：(1)RTE引导的验证单元构建和优先级排序；(2)LLM辅助的单元级过程间规范合成

Result: 提出了Preguss框架，为大规模程序自动化验证开辟了新路径

Conclusion: Preguss通过静态分析与演绎验证的协同，为解决大规模程序验证的自动化问题提供了有前景的方案

Abstract: Fully automated verification of large-scale software and hardware systems is
arguably the holy grail of formal methods. Large language models (LLMs) have
recently demonstrated their potential for enhancing the degree of automation in
formal verification by, e.g., generating formal specifications as essential to
deductive verification, yet exhibit poor scalability due to context-length
limitations and, more importantly, the difficulty of inferring complex,
interprocedural specifications. This paper outlines Preguss - a modular,
fine-grained framework for automating the generation and refinement of formal
specifications. Preguss synergizes between static analysis and deductive
verification by orchestrating two components: (i) potential runtime error
(RTE)-guided construction and prioritization of verification units, and (ii)
LLM-aided synthesis of interprocedural specifications at the unit level. We
envisage that Preguss paves a compelling path towards the automated
verification of large-scale programs.

TL;DR: 使用生成式AI和系统过程数据自动生成自然语言调试解释，减少手动调试的资源消耗


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决越来越复杂和分布式软件系统中手动调试资源涉及效率低下的问题

Method: 利用系统过程数据、接口信息和文档，结合生成式AI生成自然语言解释，并在组件化Java系统中实现了示例应用

Result: 开发了一个语言无关的开源web应用，能够生成对过程和子过程行为及错误的解释

Conclusion: 该方法可在宏观和微观层面应用于任意系统，帮助开发者更高效地理解系统行为和调试错误

Abstract: In this paper, we address the problem of manual debugging, which nowadays
remains resource-intensive and in some parts archaic. This problem is
especially evident in increasingly complex and distributed software systems.
Therefore, our objective of this work is to introduce an approach that can
possibly be applied to any system, at both the macro- and micro-level, to ease
this debugging process. This approach utilizes a system's process data, in
conjunction with generative AI, to generate natural-language explanations.
These explanations are generated from the actual process data, interface
information, and documentation to guide the developers more efficiently to
understand the behavior and possible errors of a process and its sub-processes.
Here, we present a demonstrator that employs this approach on a component-based
Java system. However, our approach is language-agnostic. Ideally, the generated
explanations will provide a good understanding of the process, even if
developers are not familiar with all the details of the considered system. Our
demonstrator is provided as an open-source web application that is freely
accessible to all users.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种使用大语言模型自动生成基于组件问答系统的可解释性方法，通过分析组件的SPARQL查询输入和RDF三元组输出数据流来提供解释，实验表明LLM生成解释的质量优于模板方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着软件系统复杂度的增加，基于AI方法的问答系统组件行为和决策难以解释，即使是专家也难以理解执行过程和结果，需要提供可解释性机制。

Method: 利用组件输入(SPARQL查询)和输出(RDF三元组)数据流作为解释源，采用基于模板的方法(基线)和大语言模型(LLM)自动生成解释，并对不同配置进行比较。

Result: 评估显示LLM生成的解释质量较高，在用户评分中大多优于基于模板的方法，能够有效解释QA组件的行为和决策。

Conclusion: 该方法成功实现了使用RDF和SPARQL作为解释上下文，自动向人类解释问答系统组件行为和决策的目标，LLM在生成高质量解释方面表现出色。

Abstract: Over time, software systems have reached a level of complexity that makes it
difficult for their developers and users to explain particular decisions made
by them. In this paper, we focus on the explainability of component-based
systems for Question Answering (QA). These components often conduct processes
driven by AI methods, in which behavior and decisions cannot be clearly
explained or justified, s.t., even for QA experts interpreting the executed
process and its results is hard. To address this challenge, we present an
approach that considers the components' input and output data flows as a source
for representing the behavior and provide explanations for the components,
enabling users to comprehend what happened. In the QA framework used here, the
data flows of the components are represented as SPARQL queries (inputs) and RDF
triples (outputs). Hence, we are also providing valuable insights on
verbalization regarding these data types. In our experiments, the approach
generates explanations while following template-based settings (baseline) or
via the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) with different configurations
(automatic generation). Our evaluation shows that the explanations generated
via LLMs achieve high quality and mostly outperform template-based approaches
according to the users' ratings. Therefore, it enables us to automatically
explain the behavior and decisions of QA components to humans while using RDF
and SPARQL as a context for explanations.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着多模态系统在软件系统中的普及，需要一种能够描述涉及多种输入类型（文本、音频、图像等）同时交互的需求规范语言，但目前缺乏适合多模态交互特性的语言和方法。

Method: 提出了MERLAN DSL，包括其元模型和基于ANTLR的文法实现的文本语法，并开发了原型工具，允许需求工程师编写需求并自动生成基于智能体框架的合规系统实现。

Result: 开发了一个完整的DSL语言规范及其工具链，能够支持多模态界面需求的精确描述和自动化实现。

Conclusion: MERLAN DSL为解决多模态系统需求规范问题提供了有效的解决方案，有助于确保AI增强系统更好地满足用户需求。

Abstract: Multimodal systems, which process multiple input types such as text, audio,
and images, are becoming increasingly prevalent in software systems, enabled by
the huge advancements in Machine Learning. This triggers the need to easily
define the requirements linked to these new types of user interactions,
potentially involving more than one modality at the same time. This remains an
open challenge due to the lack of languages and methods adapted to the diverse
nature of multimodal interactions, with the risk of implementing AI-enhanced
systems that do not properly satisfy the user needs.
  In this sense, this paper presents MERLAN, a Domain-Specific Language (DSL)
to specify the requirements for these new types of multimodal interfaces. We
present the metamodel for such language together with a textual syntax
implemented as an ANTLR grammar. A prototype tool enabling requirements
engineers to write such requirements and automatically generate a possible
implementation of a system compliant with them on top of an agentic framework
is also provided.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 这项研究通过SonarQube静态分析对5款主流大语言模型生成的4,442个Java代码进行评估，发现LLM虽能生成功能性代码，但常带来软件缺陷、安全漏洞和代码异味，需要静态分析验证才能用于生产环境。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然之前研究已评估LLM生成代码的功能性能力，但缺乏对代码质量和安全性的系统性量化分析，需要全面了解LLM生成代码的漏洞模式和系统性问题。

Method: 使用SonarQube静态分析工具对5款主流LLM（Claude Sonnet 4、Claude 3.7 Sonnet、GPT-4o、Llama 3.2 90B、OpenCoder 8B）生成的4,442个Java编程作业进行综合评估，分析代码缺陷、安全漏洞和代码异味。

Result: 发现所有模型都存在共同的系统性弱点，包括硬编码密码、路径遍历漏洞等严重问题。功能性能力（Pass@1率）与代码质量安全性无直接相关性，功能测试成绩不能代表整体代码质量。

Conclusion: LLM生成代码需要静态分析验证才能用于生产环境，静态分析是检测潜在缺陷的重要工具，对于部署AI软件开发的组织具有重要保护作用。

Abstract: This study presents a quantitative evaluation of the code quality and
security of five prominent Large Language Models (LLMs): Claude Sonnet 4,
Claude 3.7 Sonnet, GPT-4o, Llama 3.2 90B, and OpenCoder 8B. While prior
research has assessed the functional performance of LLM-generated code, this
research tested LLM output from 4,442 Java coding assignments through
comprehensive static analysis using SonarQube. The findings suggest that
although LLMs can generate functional code, they also introduce a range of
software defects, including bugs, security vulnerabilities, and code smells.
These defects do not appear to be isolated; rather, they may represent shared
weaknesses stemming from systemic limitations within current LLM code
generation methods. In particular, critically severe issues, such as hard-coded
passwords and path traversal vulnerabilities, were observed across multiple
models. These results indicate that LLM-generated code requires verification in
order to be considered production-ready. This study found no direct correlation
between a model's functional performance (measured by Pass@1 rate of unit
tests) and the overall quality and security of its generated code, measured by
the number of SonarQube issues in benchmark solutions that passed the
functional tests. This suggests that functional benchmark performance score is
not a good indicator of overall code quality and security. The goal of this
study is not to rank LLM performance but to highlight that all evaluated models
appear to share certain weaknesses. Consequently, these findings support the
view that static analysis can be a valuable instrument for detecting latent
defects and an important safeguard for organizations that deploy AI in software
development.

Motivation: 车辆验证验证是确保安全的关键过程，但实现真实有用的模拟面临重大挑战，需要系统性地识别主要障碍和解决方案

Method: 举办专家研讨会进行头脑风暴识别关键挑战，随后分发调查问卷以整合发现并深入了解潜在解决方案

Conclusion: 许多已识别的问题已有已知解决方案，可以将重点转向未解决的挑战，并与更广泛社区分享下一步骤，资源不足是主要实施障碍

Abstract: Verification and validation of vehicles is a complex yet critical process,
particularly for ensuring safety and coverage through simulations. However,
achieving realistic and useful simulations comes with significant challenges.
To explore these challenges, we conducted a workshop with experts in the field,
allowing them to brainstorm key obstacles. Following this, we distributed a
survey to consolidate findings and gain further insights into potential
solutions. The experts identified 17 key challenges, along with proposed
solutions, an assessment of whether they represent next steps for research, and
the roadblocks to their implementation. While a lack of resources was not
initially highlighted as a major challenge, utilizing more resources emerged as
a critical necessity when experts discussed solutions. Interestingly, we
expected some of these challenges to have already been addressed or to have
systematic solutions readily available, given the collective expertise in the
field. Many of the identified problems already have known solutions, allowing
us to shift focus towards unresolved challenges and share the next steps with
the broader community.

*Pablo G. Almeida,Guilherme A. L. Silva,Valéria Santos,Gladston Moreira,Pedro Silva,Eduardo Luz*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本研究探讨了将表格学生数据转换为图结构是否能提升辍学预测准确率，发现特定的GNN配置（GraphSAGE+PCA-KMeans）比传统表格模型表现更好，但图生成策略和架构选择至关重要。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 学生辍学是全球教育系统的重大挑战，传统机器学习模型在表格数据上已有不错表现，但图神经网络(GNNs)可能通过捕捉学生数据中的复杂关系来提供优势。

Method: 将表格学生数据转换为图结构（主要使用聚类技术），比较GNNs（自定义GCN和GraphSAGE）与表格模型（随机森林、XGBoost、TabNet）的性能，探索基于不同聚类算法（K-Means、HDBSCAN）和降维技术（PCA、UMAP）的图构建策略。

Result: 特定的GNN配置（GraphSAGE在PCA-KMeans聚类生成的图上）表现最优，比最强的表格基线（XGBoost）在宏观F1分数上提升约7个百分点，准确率提升近2个百分点。但其他GNN配置和图构建方法并未一致超越表格模型。

Conclusion: GNNs在辍学预测中具有潜力，但表格数据到图结构的优化转换以及GNN架构选择是成功的关键因素，这既展示了GNNs的前景也凸显了该领域的挑战。

Abstract: Student dropout is a significant challenge in educational systems worldwide,
leading to substantial social and economic costs. Predicting students at risk
of dropout allows for timely interventions. While traditional Machine Learning
(ML) models operating on tabular data have shown promise, Graph Neural Networks
(GNNs) offer a potential advantage by capturing complex relationships inherent
in student data if structured as graphs. This paper investigates whether
transforming tabular student data into graph structures, primarily using
clustering techniques, enhances dropout prediction accuracy. We compare the
performance of GNNs (a custom Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) and GraphSAGE)
on these generated graphs against established tabular models (Random Forest
(RF), XGBoost, and TabNet) using a real-world student dataset. Our experiments
explore various graph construction strategies based on different clustering
algorithms (K-Means, HDBSCAN) and dimensionality reduction techniques
(Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Uniform Manifold Approximation and
Projection (UMAP)). Our findings demonstrate that a specific GNN configuration,
GraphSAGE on a graph derived from PCA-KMeans clustering, achieved superior
performance, notably improving the macro F1-score by approximately 7 percentage
points and accuracy by nearly 2 percentage points over the strongest tabular
baseline (XGBoost). However, other GNN configurations and graph construction
methods did not consistently surpass tabular models, emphasizing the critical
role of the graph generation strategy and GNN architecture selection. This
highlights both the potential of GNNs and the challenges in optimally
transforming tabular data for graph-based learning in this domain.

TL;DR: STAS框架通过时空自适应计算时间方法，解决了脉冲神经网络在视觉Transformer中的高延迟和计算开销问题，显著降低能耗同时提升准确率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 脉冲神经网络(SNNs)虽然比人工神经网络(ANNs)更节能，但由于多时间步操作特性导致高延迟和计算开销。现有动态计算方法分散且不统一，自适应计算时间(ACT)原则虽提供了统一基础，但在SNN-based ViTs中存在时间相似性前提违反和静态架构不适配两大核心问题

Method: 提出STAS框架，通过集成脉冲块分割(I-SPS)模块建立时间稳定性，创建统一输入表示解决时间不相似性问题；采用自适应脉冲自注意力(A-SSA)模块在空间和时间维度进行二维token剪枝

Result: 在CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100和ImageNet数据集上验证，能耗分别降低45.9%、43.8%和30.1%，同时准确率超过最先进模型

Conclusion: STAS通过协同设计静态架构和动态计算策略，成功解决了SNN-based ViTs中的核心挑战，实现了显著的能耗降低和性能提升

Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) offer energy efficiency over artificial neural
networks (ANNs) but suffer from high latency and computational overhead due to
their multi-timestep operational nature. While various dynamic computation
methods have been developed to mitigate this by targeting spatial, temporal, or
architecture-specific redundancies, they remain fragmented. While the
principles of adaptive computation time (ACT) offer a robust foundation for a
unified approach, its application to SNN-based vision Transformers (ViTs) is
hindered by two core issues: the violation of its temporal similarity
prerequisite and a static architecture fundamentally unsuited for its
principles. To address these challenges, we propose STAS (Spatio-Temporal
Adaptive computation time for Spiking transformers), a framework that
co-designs the static architecture and dynamic computation policy. STAS
introduces an integrated spike patch splitting (I-SPS) module to establish
temporal stability by creating a unified input representation, thereby solving
the architectural problem of temporal dissimilarity. This stability, in turn,
allows our adaptive spiking self-attention (A-SSA) module to perform
two-dimensional token pruning across both spatial and temporal axes.
Implemented on spiking Transformer architectures and validated on CIFAR-10,
CIFAR-100, and ImageNet, STAS reduces energy consumption by up to 45.9%, 43.8%,
and 30.1%, respectively, while simultaneously improving accuracy over SOTA
models.

Motivation: 现实数据集中的稀疏性（缺失值或零值）给数据分析带来挑战，特别是在电力负荷预测中，需要找到适合处理稀疏数据的插值方法

Method: 对小时级电力负荷数据进行统计分析，使用高斯插值处理稀疏数据，训练多种机器学习和深度学习模型（包括LSTM）进行负荷预测

Conclusion: 高斯插值是处理稀疏电力负荷数据的有效方法，LSTM模型为负荷预测提供了最佳性能解决方案

Abstract: Sparsity, defined as the presence of missing or zero values in a dataset,
often poses a major challenge while operating on real-life datasets. Sparsity
in features or target data of the training dataset can be handled using various
interpolation methods, such as linear or polynomial interpolation, spline,
moving average, or can be simply imputed. Interpolation methods usually perform
well with Strict Sense Stationary (SSS) data. In this study, we show that an
approximately 62\% sparse dataset with hourly load data of a power plant can be
utilized for load forecasting assuming the data is Wide Sense Stationary (WSS),
if augmented with Gaussian interpolation. More specifically, we perform
statistical analysis on the data, and train multiple machine learning and deep
learning models on the dataset. By comparing the performance of these models,
we empirically demonstrate that Gaussian interpolation is a suitable option for
dealing with load forecasting problems. Additionally, we demonstrate that Long
Short-term Memory (LSTM)-based neural network model offers the best performance
among a diverse set of classical and neural network-based models.

Conclusion: 该混合机制具有良好的可扩展性和通用性，通过学习指导元渗道搜索，在车辆路由问题中显著提高了解决方案的质量。

Abstract: This research proposes a hybrid Machine Learning and metaheuristic mechanism
that is designed to solve Vehicle Routing Problems (VRPs). The main of our
method is an edge solution selector model, which classifies solution edges to
identify prohibited moves during the local search, hence guiding the search
process within metaheuristic baselines. Two learning-based mechanisms are used
to develop the edge selector: a simple tabular binary classifier and a Graph
Neural Network (GNN). The tabular classifier employs Gradient Boosting Trees
and Feedforward Neural Network as the baseline algorithms. Adjustments to the
decision threshold are also applied to handle the class imbalance in the
problem instance. An alternative mechanism employs the GNN to utilize graph
structure for direct solution edge prediction, with the objective of guiding
local search by predicting prohibited moves. These hybrid mechanisms are then
applied in state-fo-the-art metaheuristic baselines. Our method demonstrates
both scalability and generalizability, achieving performance improvements
across different baseline metaheuristics, various problem sizes and variants,
including the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) and CVRP with Time
Windows (CVRPTW). Experimental evaluations on benchmark datasets up to 30,000
customer nodes, supported by pair-wise statistical analysis, verify the
observed improvements.

Result: 仅使用1%标注数据时，在UI和UC数据集上分别获得0.91和0.81的F1分数；使用5%标注数据时分别提升至0.97和0.87

Conclusion: MCLPD显著提高了跨数据集泛化能力，同时减少了对标注数据的依赖，证明了所提框架的有效性

Abstract: Electroencephalography has been validated as an effective technique for
detecting Parkinson's disease,particularly in its early stages.However,the high
cost of EEG data annotation often results in limited dataset size and
considerable discrepancies across datasets,including differences in acquisition
protocols and subject demographics,significantly hinder the robustness and
generalizability of models in cross-dataset detection scenarios.To address such
challenges,this paper proposes a semi-supervised learning framework named
MCLPD,which integrates multi-view contrastive pre-training with lightweight
supervised fine-tuning to enhance cross-dataset PD detection performance.During
pre-training,MCLPD uses self-supervised learning on the unlabeled UNM
dataset.To build contrastive pairs,it applies dual augmentations in both time
and frequency domains,which enrich the data and naturally fuse time-frequency
information.In the fine-tuning phase,only a small proportion of labeled data
from another two datasets (UI and UC)is used for supervised
optimization.Experimental results show that MCLPD achieves F1 scores of 0.91 on
UI and 0.81 on UC using only 1%of labeled data,which further improve to 0.97
and 0.87,respectively,when 5%of labeled data is used.Compared to existing
methods,MCLPD substantially improves cross-dataset generalization while
reducing the dependency on labeled data,demonstrating the effectiveness of the
proposed framework.

Abstract: Electroencephalography has been established as an effective method for
detecting Parkinson's disease, typically diagnosed early.Current Parkinson's
disease detection methods have shown significant success within individual
datasets, however, the variability in detection methods across different EEG
datasets and the small size of each dataset pose challenges for training a
generalizable model for cross-dataset scenarios. To address these issues, this
paper proposes a GAN-enhanced generalizable model, named GEPD, specifically for
EEG-based cross-dataset classification of Parkinson's disease.First, we design
a generative network that creates fusion EEG data by controlling the
distribution similarity between generated data and real data.In addition, an
EEG signal quality assessment model is designed to ensure the quality of
generated data great.Second, we design a classification network that utilizes a
combination of multiple convolutional neural networks to effectively capture
the time-frequency characteristics of EEG signals, while maintaining a
generalizable structure and ensuring easy convergence.This work is dedicated to
utilizing intelligent methods to study pathological manifestations, aiming to
facilitate the diagnosis and monitoring of neurological diseases.The evaluation
results demonstrate that our model performs comparably to state-of-the-art
models in cross-dataset settings, achieving an accuracy of 84.3% and an

TL;DR: PersRM-R1是一个基于推理的奖励建模框架，通过合成数据生成和两阶段训练，从少量个人示例中识别个性化偏好，在准确性和泛化性方面优于同类模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的奖励模型难以捕捉用户特定的细微偏好，特别是在数据有限和跨领域的情况下，需要开发能够从少量个人示例中有效识别个性化因素的解决方案。

Method: 结合合成数据生成和两阶段训练流程（监督微调后接强化微调），专门设计用于从一两个个人示例中识别和表示个人因素。

Result: 实验结果表明PersRM-R1在相似规模模型中表现最优，并能与更大模型的性能相匹配，在准确性和泛化性方面都有显著提升。

Abstract: Reward models (RMs), which are central to existing post-training methods, aim
to align LLM outputs with human values by providing feedback signals during
fine-tuning. However, existing RMs struggle to capture nuanced, user-specific
preferences, especially under limited data and across diverse domains. Thus, we
introduce PersRM-R1, the first reasoning-based reward modeling framework
specifically designed to identify and represent personal factors from only one
or a few personal exemplars. To address challenges including limited data
availability and the requirement for robust generalization, our approach
combines synthetic data generation with a two-stage training pipeline
consisting of supervised fine-tuning followed by reinforcement fine-tuning.
Experimental results demonstrate that PersRM-R1 outperforms existing models of
similar size and matches the performance of much larger models in both accuracy
and generalizability, paving the way for more effective personalized LLMs.

Conclusion: 标签平滑可解释为信息瓶颈的一种实用实现方式，具有信息瓶颈方法的特性，为理解其作用机制提供了新的理论视角。

Abstract: This study revisits label smoothing via a form of information bottleneck.
Under the assumption of sufficient model flexibility and no conflicting labels
for the same input, we theoretically and experimentally demonstrate that the
model output obtained through label smoothing explores the optimal solution of
the information bottleneck. Based on this, label smoothing can be interpreted
as a practical approach to the information bottleneck, enabling simple
implementation. As an information bottleneck method, we experimentally show
that label smoothing also exhibits the property of being insensitive to factors
that do not contain information about the target, or to factors that provide no
additional information about it when conditioned on another variable.

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一个结合生产力指数特征选择和归纳共形预测的机器学习框架，用于提高油气产量预测的鲁棒性和不确定性量化，在多个油田数据上验证了LSTM模型的优越性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统油气产量预测方法在处理复杂多变量时间序列时存在鲁棒性不足和不确定性量化困难的问题，需要结合领域知识和先进机器学习技术来提高预测可靠性。

Method: 采用生产力指数驱动的特征选择方法降低输入维度，结合归纳共形预测进行不确定性量化，并使用LSTM、BiLSTM、GRU和XGBoost等多种算法进行多变量时间序列预测。

Result: LSTM模型表现最佳，在PF14井测试集和真实样本外预测数据上分别获得最低MAE（19.468和29.638），并在Norne油田E1H井得到验证。PI特征选择有效降低了输入维度。

Conclusion: 将领域专业知识与先进机器学习技术相结合，能够显著提高油气产量预测的可靠性，为复杂非正态数据的预测提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: This research introduces a new ML framework designed to enhance the
robustness of out-of-sample hydrocarbon production forecasting, specifically
addressing multivariate time series analysis. The proposed methodology
integrates Productivity Index (PI)-driven feature selection, a concept derived
from reservoir engineering, with Inductive Conformal Prediction (ICP) for
rigorous uncertainty quantification. Utilizing historical data from the Volve
(wells PF14, PF12) and Norne (well E1H) oil fields, this study investigates the
efficacy of various predictive algorithms-namely Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM),
Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), and eXtreme Gradient
Boosting (XGBoost) - in forecasting historical oil production rates (OPR_H).
All the models achieved "out-of-sample" production forecasts for an upcoming
future timeframe. Model performance was comprehensively evaluated using
traditional error metrics (e.g., MAE) supplemented by Forecast Bias and
Prediction Direction Accuracy (PDA) to assess bias and trend-capturing
capabilities. The PI-based feature selection effectively reduced input
dimensionality compared to conventional numerical simulation workflows. The
uncertainty quantification was addressed using the ICP framework, a
distribution-free approach that guarantees valid prediction intervals (e.g.,
95% coverage) without reliance on distributional assumptions, offering a
distinct advantage over traditional confidence intervals, particularly for
complex, non-normal data. Results demonstrated the superior performance of the
LSTM model, achieving the lowest MAE on test (19.468) and genuine out-of-sample
forecast data (29.638) for well PF14, with subsequent validation on Norne well
E1H. These findings highlight the significant potential of combining
domain-specific knowledge with advanced ML techniques to improve the
reliability of hydrocarbon production forecasts.

Abstract: Deep learning models operating in the image domain are vulnerable to small
input perturbations. For years, robustness to such perturbations was pursued by
training models from scratch (i.e., with random initializations) using
specialized loss objectives. Recently, robust fine-tuning has emerged as a more
efficient alternative: instead of training from scratch, pretrained models are
adapted to maximize predictive performance and robustness. To conduct robust
fine-tuning, practitioners design an optimization strategy that includes the
model update protocol (e.g., full or partial) and the specialized loss
objective. Additional design choices include the architecture type and size,
and the pretrained representation. These design choices affect robust
generalization, which is the model's ability to maintain performance when
exposed to new and unseen perturbations at test time. Understanding how these
design choices influence generalization remains an open question with
significant practical implications. In response, we present an empirical study
spanning 6 datasets, 40 pretrained architectures, 2 specialized losses, and 3
adaptation protocols, yielding 1,440 training configurations and 7,200
robustness measurements across five perturbation types. To our knowledge, this
is the most diverse and comprehensive benchmark of robust fine-tuning to date.
While attention-based architectures and robust pretrained representations are
increasingly popular, we find that convolutional neural networks pretrained in
a supervised manner on large datasets often perform best. Our analysis both
confirms and challenges prior design assumptions, highlighting promising
research directions and offering practical guidance.

Abstract: Referring Expression Comprehension (REC) is a popular multimodal task that
aims to accurately detect target objects within a single image based on a given
textual expression. However, due to the limitations of earlier models,
traditional REC benchmarks either rely solely on intra-image cues or lack
sufficiently fine-grained instance annotations, making them inadequate for
evaluating the reasoning capabilities of Multi-modal Large Language Models
(MLLMs). To address this gap, we propose a new benchmark, KnowDR-REC,
characterized by three key features: Firstly, it is built upon real-world
knowledge, requiring fine-grained multimodal reasoning across text and image.
Secondly, the dataset includes elaborately constructed negative samples via
fine-grained expression editing, designed to evaluate a model's robustness and
anti-hallucination ability. Lastly, we introduce three novel evaluation metrics
to systematically explore the model's internal reasoning process. We evaluate
16 state-of-the-art multimodal models on KnowDR-REC, with experimental results
showing that existing MLLMs still struggle with knowledge-driven visual
grounding tasks. Furthermore, we observe a decoupling between textual
understanding and visual grounding in MLLMs, where many models are
significantly influenced by memorized shortcut correlations, which severely
affect their behavior on our benchmark and hinder genuine multimodal reasoning.
We anticipate that the proposed benchmark will inspire future research towards
developing more robust, interpretable, and knowledge-intensive visual grounding
frameworks, driving the development of more reliable and robust multimodal
systems for complex real-world scenarios.

Motivation: 基于平衡传播训练的循环神经网络在持续学习中面临灾难性遗忘问题，而人类大脑通过睡眠中的记忆回放巩固机制能够有效保留新旧知识，这启发了研究者开发类似的算法。

Method: 提出了睡眠式回放巩固(SRC)算法，在每次新任务训练后实施，通过回放已学习信息来巩固记忆。还将SRC与排练(清醒回放)相结合来进一步提升性能。

Result: SRC显著提高了RNN对灾难性遗忘的抵抗力。在多个数据集上，配备SRC的MRNN-EP模型表现优于包含正则化技术的前馈网络，在Fashion MNIST等数据集上甚至超过了基于BPTT的模型。

Conclusion: 研究表明睡眠式回放技术适用于循环神经网络，为将人类学习行为整合到人工神经网络中展现了潜力，SRC与排练结合能进一步提升网络在持续学习中长期知识保留的能力。

Abstract: Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) trained using Equilibrium Propagation (EP),
a biologically plausible training algorithm, have demonstrated strong
performance in various tasks such as image classification and reinforcement
learning. However, these networks face a critical challenge in continuous
learning: catastrophic forgetting, where previously acquired knowledge is
overwritten when new tasks are learned. This limitation contrasts with the
human brain's ability to retain and integrate both old and new knowledge, aided
by processes like memory consolidation during sleep through the replay of
learned information. To address this challenge in RNNs, here we propose a
sleep-like replay consolidation (SRC) algorithm for EP-trained RNNs. We found
that SRC significantly improves RNN's resilience to catastrophic forgetting in
continuous learning scenarios. In class-incremental learning with SRC
implemented after each new task training, the EP-trained multilayer RNN model
(MRNN-EP) performed significantly better compared to feedforward networks
incorporating several well-established regularization techniques. The MRNN-EP
performed on par with MRNN trained using Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT)
when both were equipped with SRC on MNIST data and surpassed BPTT-based models
on the Fashion MNIST, Kuzushiji-MNIST, CIFAR10, and ImageNet datasets.
Combining SRC with rehearsal, also known as "awake replay", further boosted the
network's ability to retain long-term knowledge while continuing to learn new
tasks. Our study reveals the applicability of sleep-like replay techniques to
RNNs and highlights the potential for integrating human-like learning behaviors
into artificial neural networks (ANNs).

Conclusion: DRILL框架通过离散分布估计和解耦分布对齐，有效解决了半监督回归中的过拟合问题，提高了模型性能。

Abstract: Semi-supervised regression (SSR), which aims to predict continuous scores of
samples while reducing reliance on a large amount of labeled data, has recently
received considerable attention across various applications, including computer
vision, natural language processing, and audio and medical analysis. Existing
semi-supervised methods typically apply consistency regularization on the
general regression task by generating pseudo-labels. However, these methods
heavily rely on the quality of pseudo-labels, and direct regression fails to
learn the label distribution and can easily lead to overfitting. To address
these challenges, we introduce an end-to-end Decoupled Representation
distillation framework (DRILL) which is specially designed for the
semi-supervised regression task where we transform the general regression task
into a Discrete Distribution Estimation (DDE) task over multiple buckets to
better capture the underlying label distribution and mitigate the risk of
overfitting associated with direct regression. Then we employ the Decoupled
Distribution Alignment (DDA) to align the target bucket and non-target bucket
between teacher and student on the distribution of buckets, encouraging the
student to learn more robust and generalized knowledge from the teacher.
Extensive experiments conducted on datasets from diverse domains demonstrate
that the proposed DRILL has strong generalization and outperforms the competing
methods.

Conclusion: 提出的CST框架通过自监督对比学习有效解决了POI人群流量推断中的数据质量挑战，为城市交通管理和规划提供了可靠的技术方案。

Abstract: Accurate acquisition of crowd flow at Points of Interest (POIs) is pivotal
for effective traffic management, public service, and urban planning. Despite
this importance, due to the limitations of urban sensing techniques, the data
quality from most sources is inadequate for monitoring crowd flow at each POI.
This renders the inference of accurate crowd flow from low-quality data a
critical and challenging task. The complexity is heightened by three key
factors: 1) \emph{The scarcity and rarity of labeled data}, 2) \emph{The
intricate spatio-temporal dependencies among POIs}, and 3) \emph{The myriad
correlations between precise crowd flow and GPS reports}.
  To address these challenges, we recast the crowd flow inference problem as a
self-supervised attributed graph representation learning task and introduce a
novel \underline{C}ontrastive \underline{S}elf-learning framework for
\underline{S}patio-\underline{T}emporal data (\model). Our approach initiates
with the construction of a spatial adjacency graph founded on the POIs and
their respective distances. We then employ a contrastive learning technique to
exploit large volumes of unlabeled spatio-temporal data. We adopt a swapped
prediction approach to anticipate the representation of the target subgraph
from similar instances. Following the pre-training phase, the model is
fine-tuned with accurate crowd flow data. Our experiments, conducted on two
real-world datasets, demonstrate that the \model pre-trained on extensive noisy
data consistently outperforms models trained from scratch.

Motivation: 解决SINDy方法在处理多参数模拟数据时的限制，开发能够发现物理意义明确的子网格闭包模型的自动化方法，以补充现有汽流模拟方法的不足。

Method: 继承SINDy框架，提出四项核心技术：符号参数化允许物理参数在统一回归中变化；量纲相似性筛选器确保单位一致性并缩减候选库；内存高效的Gram矩阵累积支持批处理；集成共识和系数稳定性分析确保模型识别的稳健性。

Result: 在标准一维测试中可靠恢复控制方程，在过滤Burgers流数据中自主发现了Smagorinsky型闭包模型：τ_SGS = 0.1603·Δ²(∂̅u/∂x)²，对应Smagorinsky常数约0.4004。该模型在不同过滤尺度下达到R²=0.886，预测准确性超过传统闭包方法。

Conclusion: 该框架能够从数据中自主发现物理意义明确的子网格闭包形式并检验系数，为汽流模拟领域提供了一种补充性的数据驱动方法，促进了数据驱动闭包发现领域的发展。

Abstract: We present a scalable, parameter-aware sparse regression framework for
discovering interpretable partial differential equations and subgrid-scale
closures from multi-parameter simulation data. Building on SINDy (Sparse
Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics), our approach addresses key limitations
through four innovations: symbolic parameterisation enabling physical
parameters to vary within unified regression; Dimensional Similarity Filter
enforcing unit-consistency whilst reducing candidate libraries;
memory-efficient Gram-matrix accumulation enabling batch processing; and
ensemble consensus with coefficient stability analysis for robust model
identification.
  Validation on canonical one-dimensional benchmarks demonstrates reliable
recovery of governing equations across parameter ranges. Applied to filtered
Burgers datasets, the framework discovers an SGS closure $\tau_{\mathrm{SGS}} =
0.1603\cdot\Delta^2\left(\frac{\partial \bar{u}}{\partial x}\right)^2$,
corresponding to a Smagorinsky constant of approximately 0.4004. This
represents autonomous discovery of Smagorinsky-type closure structure from data
without prior theoretical assumptions.
  The discovered model achieves $R^2 = 0.886$ across filter scales and
demonstrates improved prediction accuracy compared to classical closures. The
framework's ability to identify physically meaningful SGS forms and calibrate
coefficients offers a complementary approach to existing turbulence modelling
methods, contributing to the growing field of data-driven closure discovery.

Abstract: While electroencephalogram (EEG) has been a crucial tool for monitoring the
brain and diagnosing neurological disorders (e.g., epilepsy), learning
meaningful representations from raw EEG signals remains challenging due to
limited annotations and high signal variability. Recently, EEG foundation
models (FMs) have shown promising potential by adopting transformer
architectures and self-supervised pre-training methods from large language
models (e.g., masked prediction) to learn representations from diverse EEG
data, followed by fine-tuning on specific EEG tasks. Nonetheless, these large
models often incurred high computational costs during both training and
inference, with only marginal performance improvements as model size increases.
In this work, we proposed EEG representation learning framework building upon
Generative Diffusion Model (EEGDM). Specifically, we developed structured
state-space model for diffusion pretraining (SSMDP) to better capture the
temporal dynamics of EEG signals and trained the architecture using a Denoising
Diffusion Probabilistic Model. The resulting latent EEG representations were
then used for downstream classification tasks via our proposed latent fusion
transformer (LFT). To evaluate our method, we used the multi-event Temple
University EEG Event Corpus and compared EEGDM with current state-of-the-art
approaches, including EEG FMs. Empirical results showed that our method
outperformed existing methods while being approximately 19x more lightweight.
These findings suggested that EEGDM offered a promising alternative to current
FMs. Our code is available at: https://github.com/jhpuah/EEGDM.

Abstract: Large language models have revolutionized artificial intelligence by enabling
large, generalizable models trained through self-supervision. This paradigm has
inspired the development of scientific foundation models (FMs). However,
applying this capability to experimental particle physics is challenging due to
the sparse, spatially distributed nature of detector data, which differs
dramatically from natural language. This work addresses if an FM for particle
physics can scale and generalize across diverse tasks. We introduce a new
dataset with more than 11 million particle collision events and a suite of
downstream tasks and labeled data for evaluation. We propose a novel
self-supervised training method for detector data and demonstrate its neural
scalability with models that feature up to 188 million parameters. With frozen
weights and task-specific adapters, this FM consistently outperforms baseline
models across all downstream tasks. The performance also exhibits robust
data-efficient adaptation. Further analysis reveals that the representations
extracted by the FM are task-agnostic but can be specialized via a single
linear mapping for different downstream tasks.

Motivation: 传统异常检测主要关注个体移动模式，而集体异常检测需要建模个体间的时空依赖关系，这是一个未被充分探索的挑战领域。

Method: 提出CoBAD模型，使用集体事件序列和共现事件图表示问题，采用两阶段注意力机制分别建模个体移动模式和个体间交互，通过掩码事件和链接重建任务进行预训练。

Result: 在大规模移动数据集上的实验表明，CoBAD在AUCROC指标上提升13%-18%，在AUCPR指标上提升19%-70%，显著优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: CoBAD成功解决了集体移动行为异常检测问题，特别是能够检测被先前工作忽视的缺失异常，为公共安全和城市规划应用提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Detecting anomalies in human mobility is essential for applications such as
public safety and urban planning. While traditional anomaly detection methods
primarily focus on individual movement patterns (e.g., a child should stay at
home at night), collective anomaly detection aims to identify irregularities in
collective mobility behaviors across individuals (e.g., a child is at home
alone while the parents are elsewhere) and remains an underexplored challenge.
Unlike individual anomalies, collective anomalies require modeling
spatiotemporal dependencies between individuals, introducing additional
complexity. To address this gap, we propose CoBAD, a novel model designed to
capture Collective Behaviors for human mobility Anomaly Detection. We first
formulate the problem as unsupervised learning over Collective Event Sequences
(CES) with a co-occurrence event graph, where CES represents the event
sequences of related individuals. CoBAD then employs a two-stage attention
mechanism to model both the individual mobility patterns and the interactions
across multiple individuals. Pre-trained on large-scale collective behavior
data through masked event and link reconstruction tasks, CoBAD is able to
detect two types of collective anomalies: unexpected co-occurrence anomalies
and absence anomalies, the latter of which has been largely overlooked in prior
work. Extensive experiments on large-scale mobility datasets demonstrate that
CoBAD significantly outperforms existing anomaly detection baselines, achieving
an improvement of 13%-18% in AUCROC and 19%-70% in AUCPR. All source code is

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) are often used for the task of link prediction:
predicting missing binary facts in knowledge graphs (KGs). To address the lack
of explainability of GNNs on KGs, recent works extract Datalog rules from GNNs
with provable correspondence guarantees. The extracted rules can be used to
explain the GNN's predictions; furthermore, they can help characterise the
expressive power of various GNN models. However, these works address only a
form of link prediction based on a restricted, low-expressivity graph
encoding/decoding method. In this paper, we consider a more general and popular
approach for link prediction where a scoring function is used to decode the GNN
output into fact predictions. We show how GNNs and scoring functions can be
adapted to be monotonic, use the monotonicity to extract sound rules for
explaining predictions, and leverage existing results about the kind of rules
that scoring functions can capture. We also define procedures for obtaining
equivalent Datalog programs for certain classes of monotonic GNNs with scoring
functions. Our experiments show that, on link prediction benchmarks, monotonic
GNNs and scoring functions perform well in practice and yield many sound rules.

TL;DR: 本文介绍了物理信息奖励机(pRMs)，这是一种符号机器，用于表达强化学习中的复杂学习目标和奖励结构，通过反事实经验生成和奖励塑形技术显著提高学习效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 奖励机(RMs)为强化学习提供了结构化方法来指定非马尔可夫奖励，但需要进一步改进以处理物理环境中的复杂学习目标，提高程序化表达能力和学习效率。

Method: 提出物理信息奖励机(pRMs)概念，开发能够利用pRMs的强化学习算法，通过反事实经验生成和奖励塑形技术来加速学习过程。

Result: 实验结果表明，在有限和连续物理环境中，pRMs技术显著加速了训练阶段的奖励获取，提高了多个控制任务的学习效率。

Conclusion: 物理信息奖励机(pRMs)为强化学习提供了更可编程、更具表达力和更高效的学习框架，通过结合符号机器和物理环境知识来改善学习性能。

Abstract: Reward machines (RMs) provide a structured way to specify non-Markovian
rewards in reinforcement learning (RL), thereby improving both expressiveness
and programmability. Viewed more broadly, they separate what is known about the
environment, captured by the reward mechanism, from what remains unknown and
must be discovered through sampling. This separation supports techniques such
as counterfactual experience generation and reward shaping, which reduce sample
complexity and speed up learning. We introduce physics-informed reward machines
(pRMs), a symbolic machine designed to express complex learning objectives and
reward structures for RL agents, thereby enabling more programmable,
expressive, and efficient learning. We present RL algorithms capable of
exploiting pRMs via counterfactual experiences and reward shaping. Our
experimental results show that these techniques accelerate reward acquisition
during the training phases of RL. We demonstrate the expressiveness and
effectiveness of pRMs through experiments in both finite and continuous
physical environments, illustrating that incorporating pRMs significantly
improves learning efficiency across several control tasks.

TL;DR: 在固定预算下，选择最难样本进行GRPO微调可获得最大性能提升（47%），而简单样本效果最差，因为困难样本提供更多学习机会


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 收集高质量训练样本成本高昂，预算有限时需要确定最佳样本选择策略：应该优先选择简单、中等、困难还是随机难度的样本

Method: 使用Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)微调，基于基础模型通过多样本评估获得难度估计，比较四种不同难度子集的训练效果

Result: 训练最难样本获得最大性能提升（高达47%），训练简单样本效果最差，困难样本在GRPO训练中提供更多可学习机会

Conclusion: 预算受限的后训练中应优先选择困难样本，使用GRPO方法在推理任务上可获得显著性能提升

Abstract: Collecting high-quality training examples for language model fine-tuning is
expensive, with practical budgets limiting the amount of data that can be
procured. We investigate a critical question for resource-constrained
alignment: under a fixed acquisition budget, should practitioners prioritize
examples that are easy, medium, hard, or of random difficulty? We study Group
Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) fine-tuning across different model sizes
and families, comparing four subset selection policies chosen from the same
unlabeled pool using base-model difficulty estimates obtained via multi-sample
evaluation. Our experiments reveal that training on the hardest examples yields
the largest performance gains, up to 47%, while training on easy examples yield
the smallest gains. Analysis reveals that this effect arises from harder
examples providing more learnable opportunities during GRPO training. These
findings provide practical guidance for budget-constrained post-training:
prioritizing hard examples yields substantial performance gains on reasoning
tasks when using GRPO.

Abstract: Hypergraphs offer a generalized framework for capturing high-order
relationships between entities and have been widely applied in various domains,
including healthcare, social networks, and bioinformatics. Hypergraph neural
networks, which rely on message-passing between nodes over hyperedges to learn
latent representations, have emerged as the method of choice for predictive
tasks in many of these domains. These approaches typically perform only a small
number of message-passing rounds to learn the representations, which they then
utilize for predictions. The small number of message-passing rounds comes at a
cost, as the representations only capture local information and forego
long-range high-order dependencies. However, as we demonstrate, blindly
increasing the message-passing rounds to capture long-range dependency also
degrades the performance of hyper-graph neural networks.
  Recent works have demonstrated that implicit graph neural networks capture
long-range dependencies in standard graphs while maintaining performance.
Despite their popularity, prior work has not studied long-range dependency
issues on hypergraph neural networks. Here, we first demonstrate that existing
hypergraph neural networks lose predictive power when aggregating more
information to capture long-range dependency. We then propose Implicit
Hypergraph Neural Network (IHNN), a novel framework that jointly learns
fixed-point representations for both nodes and hyperedges in an end-to-end
manner to alleviate this issue. Leveraging implicit differentiation, we
introduce a tractable projected gradient descent approach to train the model
efficiently. Extensive experiments on real-world hypergraphs for node
classification demonstrate that IHNN outperforms the closest prior works in
most settings, establishing a new state-of-the-art in hypergraph learning.

Abstract: Trust region-based optimization methods have become foundational
reinforcement learning algorithms that offer stability and strong empirical
performance in continuous control tasks. Growing interest in scalable and
reusable control policies translate also in a demand for morphological
generalization, the ability of control policies to cope with different
kinematic structures. Graph-based policy architectures provide a natural and
effective mechanism to encode such structural differences. However, while these
architectures accommodate variable morphologies, the behavior of trust region
methods under varying action space dimensionality remains poorly understood. To
this end, we conduct a theoretical analysis of trust region-based policy
optimization methods, focusing on both Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO)
and its widely used first-order approximation, Proximal Policy Optimization
(PPO). The goal is to demonstrate how varying action space dimensionality
influence the optimization landscape, particularly under the constraints
imposed by KL-divergence or policy clipping penalties. Complementing the
theoretical insights, an empirical evaluation under morphological variation is
carried out using the Gymnasium Swimmer environment. This benchmark offers a
systematically controlled setting for varying the kinematic structure without
altering the underlying task, making it particularly well-suited to study
morphological generalization.

trace the evolution of AI for Science, (ii) identify five core capabilities

Motivation: 城市化进程中停车难问严重，特别是大学校园内学生需要快速找到空余停车位，而传统感知系统成本高且部署复杂

Method: 整合街道地图、移动性和气象数据，通过空间关联操作分析3天的停车行为模式，使用位置服务收集数据而无需感知器，评估线性回归、SVR、随机森林回归和LSTM四种预测模型

Result: 随机森林回归模型达到最低RMSE(0.142)和最高R2(0.582)，表现最佳，但LSTM模型在更长时间步长和更多数据情况下可能更优

Conclusion: 无需物理感知器的智能停车预测系统可行，随机森林回归在当前数据条件下表现最好，LSTM模型在长期时间序列预测中具有潜力

Abstract: As urban populations continue to grow, cities face numerous challenges in
managing parking and determining occupancy. This issue is particularly
pronounced in university campuses, where students need to find vacant parking
spots quickly and conveniently during class timings. The limited availability
of parking spaces on campuses underscores the necessity of implementing
efficient systems to allocate vacant parking spots effectively. We propose a
smart framework that integrates multiple data sources, including street maps,
mobility, and meteorological data, through a spatial join operation to capture
parking behavior and vehicle movement patterns over the span of 3 consecutive
days with an hourly duration between 7AM till 3PM. The system will not require
any sensing tools to be installed in the street or in the parking area to
provide its services since all the data needed will be collected using location
services. The framework will use the expected parking entrance and time to
specify a suitable parking area. Several forecasting models, namely, Linear
Regression, Support Vector Regression (SVR), Random Forest Regression (RFR),
and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), are evaluated. Hyperparameter tuning was
employed using grid search, and model performance is assessed using Root Mean
Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Coefficient of
Determination (R2). Random Forest Regression achieved the lowest RMSE of 0.142
and highest R2 of 0.582. However, given the time-series nature of the task, an
LSTM model may perform better with additional data and longer timesteps.

Conclusion: 研究展示了通过结合物理信息数据、机器学习模型和优化算法来探索新型形状记忆合金成分的实用方法，该方法可扩展到其他需要在有限数据下进行设计权衡的材料领域。

Abstract: Designing shape memory alloys (SMAs) that meet performance targets while
remaining affordable and sustainable is a complex challenge. In this work, we
focus on optimizing SMA compositions to achieve a desired martensitic start
temperature (Ms) while minimizing cost. To do this, we use machine learning
models as surrogate predictors and apply numerical optimization methods to
search for suitable alloy combinations. We trained two types of machine
learning models, a tree-based ensemble and a neural network, using a dataset of
experimentally characterized alloys and physics-informed features. The
tree-based model was used with a derivative-free optimizer (COBYLA), while the
neural network, which provides gradient information, was paired with a
gradient-based optimizer (TRUST-CONSTR). Our results show that while both
models predict Ms with similar accuracy, the optimizer paired with the neural
network finds better solutions more consistently. COBYLA often converged to
suboptimal results, especially when the starting guess was far from the target.
The TRUST-CONSTR method showed more stable behavior and was better at reaching
alloy compositions that met both objectives. This study demonstrates a
practical approach to exploring new SMA compositions by combining
physics-informed data, machine learning models, and optimization algorithms.
Although the scale of our dataset is smaller than simulation-based efforts, the
use of experimental data improves the reliability of the predictions. The
approach can be extended to other materials where design trade-offs must be
made with limited data.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前时间序列分类方法在分布外数据上表现不佳，主要原因是模型将领域特定特征和标签相关特征纠缠在一起，形成伪相关，而现有特征解耦方法缺乏语义指导

Method: 提出ERIS端到端框架：1）能量引导校准机制提供语义指导；2）权重级正交性策略强制结构独立性；3）辅助对抗训练机制注入结构化扰动增强鲁棒性

Result: 在四个基准测试上，ERIS相比最先进基线平均提升4.04%的准确率

Conclusion: 有效的特征解耦不仅需要数学约束，还需要语义指导来锚定分离过程，ERIS框架通过三种机制实现了有指导的可靠特征解耦

Abstract: An ideal time series classification (TSC) should be able to capture invariant
representations, but achieving reliable performance on out-of-distribution
(OOD) data remains a core obstacle. This obstacle arises from the way models
inherently entangle domain-specific and label-relevant features, resulting in
spurious correlations. While feature disentanglement aims to solve this,
current methods are largely unguided, lacking the semantic direction required
to isolate truly universal features. To address this, we propose an end-to-end
Energy-Regularized Information for Shift-Robustness (\textbf{ERIS}) framework
to enable guided and reliable feature disentanglement. The core idea is that
effective disentanglement requires not only mathematical constraints but also
semantic guidance to anchor the separation process. ERIS incorporates three key
mechanisms to achieve this goal. Specifically, we first introduce an
energy-guided calibration mechanism, which provides crucial semantic guidance
for the separation, enabling the model to self-calibrate. Additionally, a
weight-level orthogonality strategy enforces structural independence between
domain-specific and label-relevant features, thereby mitigating their
interference. Moreover, an auxiliary adversarial training mechanism enhances
robustness by injecting structured perturbations. Experiments demonstrate that
ERIS improves upon state-of-the-art baselines by an average of 4.04% accuracy
across four benchmarks.

Abstract: Modal testing plays a critical role in structural analysis by providing
essential insights into dynamic behaviour across a wide range of engineering
industries. In practice, designing an effective modal test campaign involves
complex experimental planning, comprising a series of interdependent decisions
that significantly influence the final test outcome. Traditional approaches to
test design are typically static-focusing only on global tests without
accounting for evolving test campaign parameters or the impact of such changes
on previously established decisions, such as sensor configurations, which have
been found to significantly influence test outcomes. These rigid methodologies
often compromise test accuracy and adaptability. To address these limitations,
this study introduces an agent-based decision support framework for adaptive
sensor placement across dynamically changing modal test environments. The
framework formulates the problem using an underspecified partially observable
Markov decision process, enabling the training of a generalist reinforcement
learning agent through a dual-curriculum learning strategy. A detailed case
study on a steel cantilever structure demonstrates the efficacy of the proposed
method in optimising sensor locations across frequency segments, validating its
robustness and real-world applicability in experimental settings.

Motivation: 宏观基本图(MFD)是描述交通动态的重要工具，但传统估计方法需要大量检测器数据，而实际应用中往往数据稀缺。需要一种能够跨城市泛化、适应不同检测器配置和拓扑结构的方法。

Method: 开发了基于元学习的多任务物理信息神经网络框架，利用多个城市的数据进行训练，使模型能够理解和适应新任务，适用于不同检测器比例和拓扑结构的城市。

Conclusion: 元学习框架在检测器数量有限的情况下具有巨大潜力，相比传统迁移学习方法表现更好，验证了其可迁移性，为非参数模型提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The Macroscopic Fundamental Diagram is a popular tool used to describe
traffic dynamics in an aggregated way, with applications ranging from traffic
control to incident analysis. However, estimating the MFD for a given network
requires large numbers of loop detectors, which is not always available in
practice. This article proposes a framework harnessing meta-learning, a
subcategory of machine learning that trains models to understand and adapt to
new tasks on their own, to alleviate the data scarcity challenge. The developed
model is trained and tested by leveraging data from multiple cities and
exploiting it to model the MFD of other cities with different shares of
detectors and topological structures. The proposed meta-learning framework is
applied to an ad-hoc Multi-Task Physics-Informed Neural Network, specifically
designed to estimate the MFD. Results show an average MSE improvement in flow
prediction ranging between ~ 17500 and 36000 (depending on the subset of loop
detectors tested). The meta-learning framework thus successfully generalizes
across diverse urban settings and improves performance on cities with limited
data, demonstrating the potential of using meta-learning when a limited number
of detectors is available. Finally, the proposed framework is validated against
traditional transfer learning approaches and tested with FitFun, a
non-parametric model from the literature, to prove its transferability.

Abstract: The structure of biological neural circuits-modular, hierarchical, and
sparsely interconnected-reflects an efficient trade-off between wiring cost,
functional specialization, and robustness. These principles offer valuable
insights for artificial neural network (ANN) design, especially as networks
grow in depth and scale. Sparsity, in particular, has been widely explored for
reducing memory and computation, improving speed, and enhancing generalization.
Motivated by systems neuroscience findings, we explore how patterns of
functional connectivity in the mouse visual cortex-specifically,
ensemble-to-ensemble communication, can inform ANN design. We introduce G2GNet,
a novel architecture that imposes sparse, modular connectivity across
feedforward layers. Despite having significantly fewer parameters than fully
connected models, G2GNet achieves superior accuracy on standard vision
benchmarks. To our knowledge, this is the first architecture to incorporate
biologically observed functional connectivity patterns as a structural bias in
ANN design. We complement this static bias with a dynamic sparse training (DST)
mechanism that prunes and regrows edges during training. We also propose a
Hebbian-inspired rewiring rule based on activation correlations, drawing on
principles of biological plasticity. G2GNet achieves up to 75% sparsity while
improving accuracy by up to 4.3% on benchmarks, including Fashion-MNIST,
CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100, outperforming dense baselines with far fewer
computations.

Motivation: 智能本质是非遍历的，需要结构化重用先前的推理轨迹而非从零优化，以解决现代AI的计算瓶颈问题

Method: 提出记忆摊销推理(MAI)框架，通过delta同调理论建模认知为记忆循环上的推理，每个皮层柱作为局部推理算子

Result: 建立了MAI与强化学习的时间反转对偶关系：RL从奖励向前传播价值，MAI从记忆向后重建潜在原因

Conclusion: MAI为基于结构、重用和记忆的智能提供了统一的生物学基础理论，对实现AGI具有深远意义

Abstract: Intelligence is fundamentally non-ergodic: it emerges not from uniform
sampling or optimization from scratch, but from the structured reuse of prior
inference trajectories. We introduce Memory-Amortized Inference (MAI) as a
formal framework in which cognition is modeled as inference over latent cycles
in memory, rather than recomputation through gradient descent. MAI systems
encode inductive biases via structural reuse, minimizing entropy and enabling
context-aware, structure-preserving inference. This approach reframes cognitive
systems not as ergodic samplers, but as navigators over constrained latent
manifolds, guided by persistent topological memory. Through the lens of
delta-homology, we show that MAI provides a principled foundation for
Mountcastle's Universal Cortical Algorithm, modeling each cortical column as a
local inference operator over cycle-consistent memory states. Furthermore, we
establish a time-reversal duality between MAI and reinforcement learning:
whereas RL propagates value forward from reward, MAI reconstructs latent causes
backward from memory. This inversion paves a path toward energy-efficient
inference and addresses the computational bottlenecks facing modern AI. MAI
thus offers a unified, biologically grounded theory of intelligence based on

probabilistic version of the Temporal Graph Network Support Vector Data
Description (TGN-SVDD) model, designed to enhance detection accuracy in the

Abstract: This contribution addresses vessel trajectory prediction (VTP), focusing on
the evaluation of different deep learning-based approaches. The objective is to
assess model performance in diverse traffic complexities and compare the
reliability of the approaches. While previous VTP models overlook the specific
traffic situation complexity and lack reliability assessments, this research
uses a probability of detection analysis to quantify model reliability in
varying traffic scenarios, thus going beyond common error distribution
analyses. All models are evaluated on test samples categorized according to
their traffic situation during the prediction horizon, with performance metrics
and reliability estimates obtained for each category. The results of this
comprehensive evaluation provide a deeper understanding of the strengths and
weaknesses of the different prediction approaches, along with their reliability
in terms of the prediction horizon lengths for which safe forecasts can be
guaranteed. These findings can inform the development of more reliable vessel
trajectory prediction approaches, enhancing safety and efficiency in future
inland waterways navigation.

TL;DR: GraphCBMs通过构建潜在概念图来增强概念瓶颈模型，解决现有方法忽略概念间相关性的问题，在保持可解释性的同时提升分类性能和干预效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有概念瓶颈模型(CBMs)假设概念在给定标签下条件独立，忽略了概念间的隐藏关系。实际上概念往往相互关联，改变一个概念会影响相关概念。

Method: 提出GraphCBMs，通过构建潜在概念图来建模概念间关系，将概念图与CBMs结合，在保持可解释性的同时增强模型性能。

Result: 在真实图像分类任务中，GraphCBMs在分类性能、概念结构信息提供、干预效果和鲁棒性方面均优于传统CBMs。

Conclusion: GraphCBMs通过显式建模概念间关系，有效解决了传统CBMs的局限性，在保持可解释性的同时显著提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) provide explicit interpretations for deep
neural networks through concepts and allow intervention with concepts to adjust
final predictions. Existing CBMs assume concepts are conditionally independent
given labels and isolated from each other, ignoring the hidden relationships
among concepts. However, the set of concepts in CBMs often has an intrinsic
structure where concepts are generally correlated: changing one concept will
inherently impact its related concepts. To mitigate this limitation, we propose
GraphCBMs: a new variant of CBM that facilitates concept relationships by
constructing latent concept graphs, which can be combined with CBMs to enhance
model performance while retaining their interpretability. Our experiment
results on real-world image classification tasks demonstrate Graph CBMs offer
the following benefits: (1) superior in image classification tasks while
providing more concept structure information for interpretability; (2) able to
utilize latent concept graphs for more effective interventions; and (3) robust
in performance across different training and architecture settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法如上下文提示优化和元学习虽然能改善泛化，但内存和计算成本高昂，需要长上下文提示或二阶梯度更新

Method: 基于摊销贝叶斯元学习框架，重新定义LoRA中的任务特定参数和全局参数，使用新超参数平衡重构精度和参数保真度

Result: 在Unified-QA和CrossFit数据集上测试，ABMLL在准确率和预期校准误差方面均优于现有方法，可扩展到Llama3-8B等大模型

Conclusion: ABMLL为LoRA微调提供了一种计算高效的方法，既能有效提升泛化性能，又能提供更好的不确定性量化

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) with low-rank adaptaion (LoRA) is a
cost-effective way to incorporate information from a specific dataset. However,
it is often unclear how well the fine-tuned LLM will generalize, i.e., how well
it will perform on unseen datasets. Methods have been proposed to improve
generalization by optimizing with in-context prompts, or by using meta-learning
to fine-tune LLMs. However, these methods are expensive in memory and
computation, requiring either long-context prompts or saving copies of
parameters and using second-order gradient updates. To address these
challenges, we propose Amortized Bayesian Meta-Learning for LoRA (ABMLL). This
method builds on amortized Bayesian meta-learning for smaller models, adapting
this approach to LLMs while maintaining its computational efficiency. We
reframe task-specific and global parameters in the context of LoRA and use a
set of new hyperparameters to balance reconstruction accuracy and the fidelity
of task-specific parameters to the global ones. ABMLL provides effective
generalization and scales to large models such as Llama3-8B. Furthermore, as a
result of using a Bayesian framework, ABMLL provides improved uncertainty
quantification. We test ABMLL on Unified-QA and CrossFit datasets and find that
it outperforms existing methods on these benchmarks in terms of both accuracy
and expected calibration error.

Motivation: 在边缘硬件上部署大语言模型需要动态剪枝来减少计算量，但现有静态方法或基于预测器的方法存在固定稀疏模式或额外运行时开销的问题，零剪枝方法在短提示/长生成场景中表现不佳。

Method: 提出A/I-GLASS方法：基于激活和影响的全局-局部神经重要性聚合，使用排名聚合结合提示局部统计和模型固有全局统计来动态选择FFN单元，无需训练、辅助预测器或推理开销。

Conclusion: GLASS提供了一种有效的训练无关动态剪枝解决方案，能够在保持质量的同时减少计算需求，特别适合边缘设备部署场景。

Abstract: Deploying Large Language Models (LLMs) on edge hardware demands aggressive,
prompt-aware dynamic pruning to reduce computation without degrading quality.
Static or predictor-based schemes either lock in a single sparsity pattern or
incur extra runtime overhead, and recent zero-shot methods that rely on
statistics from a single prompt fail on short prompt and/or long generation
scenarios. We introduce A/I-GLASS: Activation- and Impact-based Global-Local
neural importance Aggregation for feed-forward network SparSification, two
training-free methods that dynamically select FFN units using a
rank-aggregation of prompt local and model-intrinsic global neuron statistics.
Empirical results across multiple LLMs and benchmarks demonstrate that GLASS
significantly outperforms prior training-free methods, particularly in
challenging long-form generation scenarios, without relying on auxiliary
predictors or adding any inference overhead.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的测试时缩放方法存在两个分离范式：强化学习方法不稳定且样本效率低；搜索方法需要昂贵的人工标注且容易受分布偏移影响。需要一种统一的、无需标注的鲁棒解决方案

Method: 结合对抗性逆强化学习（AIRL）和群体相对策略优化（GRPO），直接从正确推理轨迹学习密集动态过程奖励模型，该模型同时作为RL的评论家和搜索的启发式引导

Result: 在8个基准测试（数学、科学推理、代码生成）中平均性能提升9%，达到GPT-4o水平。集成到多种搜索算法中均优于所有基于标注数据的基线PRM

Conclusion: RL的奖励函数就是搜索的最佳过程奖励模型，为LLM复杂推理任务提供了鲁棒且成本效益高的解决方案

Abstract: Test-time scaling (TTS) for large language models (LLMs) has thus far fallen
into two largely separate paradigms: (1) reinforcement learning (RL) methods
that optimize sparse outcome-based rewards, yet suffer from instability and low
sample efficiency; and (2) search-based techniques guided by independently
trained, static process reward models (PRMs), which require expensive human- or
LLM-generated labels and often degrade under distribution shifts. In this
paper, we introduce AIRL-S, the first natural unification of RL-based and
search-based TTS. Central to AIRL-S is the insight that the reward function
learned during RL training inherently represents the ideal PRM for guiding
downstream search. Specifically, we leverage adversarial inverse reinforcement
learning (AIRL) combined with group relative policy optimization (GRPO) to
learn a dense, dynamic PRM directly from correct reasoning traces, entirely
eliminating the need for labeled intermediate process data. At inference, the
resulting PRM simultaneously serves as the critic for RL rollouts and as a
heuristic to effectively guide search procedures, facilitating robust reasoning
chain extension, mitigating reward hacking, and enhancing cross-task
generalization. Experimental results across eight benchmarks, including
mathematics, scientific reasoning, and code generation, demonstrate that our
unified approach improves performance by 9 % on average over the base model,
matching GPT-4o. Furthermore, when integrated into multiple search algorithms,
our PRM consistently outperforms all baseline PRMs trained with labeled data.
These results underscore that, indeed, your reward function for RL is your best
PRM for search, providing a robust and cost-effective solution to complex
reasoning tasks in LLMs.

Abstract: Sub-grid parameterisations in climate models are traditionally static and
tuned offline, limiting adaptability to evolving states. This work introduces
FedRAIN-Lite, a federated reinforcement learning (FedRL) framework that mirrors
the spatial decomposition used in general circulation models (GCMs) by
assigning agents to latitude bands, enabling local parameter learning with
periodic global aggregation. Using a hierarchy of simplified energy-balance
climate models, from a single-agent baseline (ebm-v1) to multi-agent ensemble
(ebm-v2) and GCM-like (ebm-v3) setups, we benchmark three RL algorithms under
different FedRL configurations. Results show that Deep Deterministic Policy
Gradient (DDPG) consistently outperforms both static and single-agent
baselines, with faster convergence and lower area-weighted RMSE in tropical and
mid-latitude zones across both ebm-v2 and ebm-v3 setups. DDPG's ability to
transfer across hyperparameters and low computational cost make it well-suited
for geographically adaptive parameter learning. This capability offers a
scalable pathway towards high-complexity GCMs and provides a prototype for
physically aligned, online-learning climate models that can evolve with a
changing climate. Code accessible at

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于张量分解的多视图图压缩方法GCTD，通过张量分解技术替代计算密集的双层优化，在保持GNN性能的同时显著减少图规模，并在多个数据集上实现了性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前图压缩方法存在两个主要问题：1）依赖计算密集的双层优化过程；2）缺乏合成节点与原始节点之间的映射关系，限制了模型的可解释性。张量分解技术虽然在线性/多线性函数学习中表现出透明性和低资源消耗的优势，但在图压缩领域的应用尚未探索。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated remarkable results in various
real-world applications, including drug discovery, object detection, social
media analysis, recommender systems, and text classification. In contrast to
their vast potential, training them on large-scale graphs presents significant
computational challenges due to the resources required for their storage and
processing. Graph Condensation has emerged as a promising solution to reduce
these demands by learning a synthetic compact graph that preserves the
essential information of the original one while maintaining the GNN's
predictive performance. Despite their efficacy, current graph condensation
approaches frequently rely on a computationally intensive bi-level
optimization. Moreover, they fail to maintain a mapping between synthetic and
original nodes, limiting the interpretability of the model's decisions. In this
sense, a wide range of decomposition techniques have been applied to learn
linear or multi-linear functions from graph data, offering a more transparent
and less resource-intensive alternative. However, their applicability to graph
condensation remains unexplored. This paper addresses this gap and proposes a
novel method called Multi-view Graph Condensation via Tensor Decomposition
(GCTD) to investigate to what extent such techniques can synthesize an
informative smaller graph and achieve comparable downstream task performance.
Extensive experiments on six real-world datasets demonstrate that GCTD
effectively reduces graph size while preserving GNN performance, achieving up
to a 4.0\ improvement in accuracy on three out of six datasets and competitive
performance on large graphs compared to existing approaches. Our code is

Abstract: GNSS localization using everyday mobile devices is challenging in urban
environments, as ranging errors caused by the complex propagation of satellite
signals and low-quality onboard GNSS hardware are blamed for undermining
positioning accuracy. Researchers have pinned their hopes on data-driven
methods to regress such ranging errors from raw measurements. However, the
grueling annotation of ranging errors impedes their pace. This paper presents a
robust end-to-end Neural Ranging Correction (NeRC) framework, where
localization-related metrics serve as the task objective for training the
neural modules. Instead of seeking impractical ranging error labels, we train
the neural network using ground-truth locations that are relatively easy to
obtain. This functionality is supported by differentiable moving horizon
location estimation (MHE) that handles a horizon of measurements for
positioning and backpropagates the gradients for training. Even better, as a
blessing of end-to-end learning, we propose a new training paradigm using
Euclidean Distance Field (EDF) cost maps, which alleviates the demands on
labeled locations. We evaluate the proposed NeRC on public benchmarks and our
collected datasets, demonstrating its distinguished improvement in positioning
accuracy. We also deploy NeRC on the edge to verify its real-time performance
for mobile devices.

Abstract: This paper studies the interplay between learning algorithms and graph
structure for graph neural networks (GNNs). Existing theoretical studies on the
learning dynamics of GNNs primarily focus on the convergence rates of learning
algorithms under the interpolation regime (noise-free) and offer only a crude
connection between these dynamics and the actual graph structure (e.g., maximum
degree). This paper aims to bridge this gap by investigating the excessive risk
(generalization performance) of learning algorithms in GNNs within the
generalization regime (with noise). Specifically, we extend the conventional
settings from the learning theory literature to the context of GNNs and examine
how graph structure influences the performance of learning algorithms such as
stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and Ridge regression. Our study makes several
key contributions toward understanding the interplay between graph structure
and learning in GNNs. First, we derive the excess risk profiles of SGD and
Ridge regression in GNNs and connect these profiles to the graph structure
through spectral graph theory. With this established framework, we further
explore how different graph structures (regular vs. power-law) impact the
performance of these algorithms through comparative analysis. Additionally, we
extend our analysis to multi-layer linear GNNs, revealing an increasing
non-isotropic effect on the excess risk profile, thereby offering new insights
into the over-smoothing issue in GNNs from the perspective of learning
algorithms. Our empirical results align with our theoretical predictions,
\emph{collectively showcasing a coupling relation among graph structure, GNNs
and learning algorithms, and providing insights on GNN algorithm design and
selection in practice.}

Motivation: 解决RLVR方法需要昂贵标注数据且仅适用于可验证任务的限制，以及传统对偶学习仅限于严格对偶任务对的问题，旨在开发一个可扩展、通用且无需标注的LLM优化范式。

Method: 将原始任务输入分解为已知和未知组件，构建对偶任务来使用原始输出和已知信息重建未知部分（如通过数学解反推隐藏变量），重建质量作为自监督奖励来优化原始任务。

Result: 在多个任务上取得显著提升：翻译质量平均提升2.13 COMET（756个方向），数学推理准确率平均提升6.4个百分点，作为推理时重排序器性能提升9.3个百分点。

Conclusion: DuPO作为一个可扩展、通用且无需标注的LLM优化范式，在各种任务上展现出强大性能，为LLM优化提供了新的有效途径。

Abstract: We present DuPO, a dual learning-based preference optimization framework that
generates annotation-free feedback via a generalized duality. DuPO addresses
two key limitations: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR)'s
reliance on costly labels and applicability restricted to verifiable tasks, and
traditional dual learning's restriction to strictly dual task pairs (e.g.,
translation and back-translation). Specifically, DuPO decomposes a primal
task's input into known and unknown components, then constructs its dual task
to reconstruct the unknown part using the primal output and known information
(e.g., reversing math solutions to recover hidden variables), broadening
applicability to non-invertible tasks. The quality of this reconstruction
serves as a self-supervised reward to optimize the primal task, synergizing
with LLMs' ability to instantiate both tasks via a single model. Empirically,
DuPO achieves substantial gains across diverse tasks: it enhances the average
translation quality by 2.13 COMET over 756 directions, boosts the mathematical
reasoning accuracy by an average of 6.4 points on three challenge benchmarks,
and enhances performance by 9.3 points as an inference-time reranker (trading
computation for accuracy). These results position DuPO as a scalable, general,
and annotation-free paradigm for LLM optimization.

Abstract: Poaching poses significant threats to wildlife and biodiversity. A valuable
step in reducing poaching is to forecast poacher behavior, which can inform
patrol planning and other conservation interventions. Existing poaching
prediction methods based on linear models or decision trees lack the
expressivity to capture complex, nonlinear spatiotemporal patterns. Recent
advances in generative modeling, particularly flow matching, offer a more
flexible alternative. However, training such models on real-world poaching data
faces two central obstacles: imperfect detection of poaching events and limited
data. To address imperfect detection, we integrate flow matching with an
occupancy-based detection model and train the flow in latent space to infer the
underlying occupancy state. To mitigate data scarcity, we adopt a composite
flow initialized from a linear-model prediction rather than random noise which
is the standard in diffusion models, injecting prior knowledge and improving
generalization. Evaluations on datasets from two national parks in Uganda show
consistent gains in predictive accuracy.

Abstract: Score-based graph generative models (SGGMs) have proven effective in critical
applications such as drug discovery and protein synthesis. However, their
theoretical behavior, particularly regarding convergence, remains
underexplored. Unlike common score-based generative models (SGMs), which are
governed by a single stochastic differential equation (SDE), SGGMs involve a
system of coupled SDEs. In SGGMs, the graph structure and node features are
governed by separate but interdependent SDEs. This distinction makes existing
convergence analyses from SGMs inapplicable for SGGMs. In this work, we present
the first non-asymptotic convergence analysis for SGGMs, focusing on the
convergence bound (the risk of generative error) across three key graph
generation paradigms: (1) feature generation with a fixed graph structure, (2)
graph structure generation with fixed node features, and (3) joint generation
of both graph structure and node features. Our analysis reveals several unique
factors specific to SGGMs (e.g., the topological properties of the graph
structure) which affect the convergence bound. Additionally, we offer
theoretical insights into the selection of hyperparameters (e.g., sampling
steps and diffusion length) and advocate for techniques like normalization to
improve convergence. To validate our theoretical findings, we conduct a
controlled empirical study using synthetic graph models, and the results align
with our theoretical predictions. This work deepens the theoretical
understanding of SGGMs, demonstrates their applicability in critical domains,
and provides practical guidance for designing effective models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SBGD模型通过将图表示细化到块图空间，解决了图扩散生成模型在可扩展性和尺寸泛化方面的挑战，显著降低了内存复杂度并提升了泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图扩散生成模型(GDGMs)面临内存需求高、难以扩展到大型图，以及尺寸泛化能力差的问题，限制了其在实际大规模图数据中的应用。

Method: 提出随机块图扩散(SBGD)模型，将图表示细化到块图空间，融入基于真实图模式的结构先验，降低内存复杂度并改善尺寸泛化。

Result: SBGD实现了显著的内存改进(高达6倍)，同时保持或超越了最先进方法的图生成性能，并展现出更好的未见尺寸图泛化能力。

Conclusion: SBGD不仅是可扩展且有效的GDGM，还展示了生成建模中的模块化原则，为通过分解复杂任务探索生成模型提供了新途径。

Abstract: Graph diffusion generative models (GDGMs) have emerged as powerful tools for
generating high-quality graphs. However, their broader adoption faces
challenges in \emph{scalability and size generalization}. GDGMs struggle to
scale to large graphs due to their high memory requirements, as they typically
operate in the full graph space, requiring the entire graph to be stored in
memory during training and inference. This constraint limits their feasibility
for large-scale real-world graphs. GDGMs also exhibit poor size generalization,
with limited ability to generate graphs of sizes different from those in the
training data, restricting their adaptability across diverse applications. To
address these challenges, we propose the stochastic block graph diffusion
(SBGD) model, which refines graph representations into a block graph space.
This space incorporates structural priors based on real-world graph patterns,
significantly reducing memory complexity and enabling scalability to large
graphs. The block representation also improves size generalization by capturing
fundamental graph structures. Empirical results show that SBGD achieves
significant memory improvements (up to 6$\times$) while maintaining comparable
or even superior graph generation performance relative to state-of-the-art
methods. Furthermore, experiments demonstrate that SBGD better generalizes to
unseen graph sizes. The significance of SBGD extends beyond being a scalable
and effective GDGM; it also exemplifies the principle of modularization in
generative modeling, offering a new avenue for exploring generative models by
decomposing complex tasks into more manageable components.

TL;DR: Organ-Agents是一个基于大语言模型的多代理框架，通过LLM驱动的代理模拟人体生理系统，在脓毒症患者数据上表现出高精度模拟能力，并得到重症监护医生的验证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用大语言模型的新进展来模拟复杂生理系统，为精准医疗、治疗模拟和重症监护中的假设检验提供可信的数字孪生工具。

Method: 采用多代理框架，每个模拟器建模特定生理系统（如心血管、肾脏、免疫系统）。训练包括基于系统特异性时间序列数据的监督微调，以及使用动态参考选择和错误校正的强化引导协调。

Result: 在4,509名保留患者上实现高模拟精度（每系统MSE<0.16），外部验证显示在分布偏移下保持稳定模拟。15名重症监护医生确认了真实性和生理合理性（平均Likert评分3.9和3.7）。

Conclusion: Organ-Agents是一个可信、可解释且可推广的数字孪生系统，适用于精准诊断、治疗模拟和重症监护中的假设检验，在早期预警任务中表现出良好的模式保持能力。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled new
possibilities in simulating complex physiological systems. We introduce
Organ-Agents, a multi-agent framework that simulates human physiology via
LLM-driven agents. Each Simulator models a specific system (e.g.,
cardiovascular, renal, immune). Training consists of supervised fine-tuning on
system-specific time-series data, followed by reinforcement-guided coordination
using dynamic reference selection and error correction. We curated data from
7,134 sepsis patients and 7,895 controls, generating high-resolution
trajectories across 9 systems and 125 variables. Organ-Agents achieved high
simulation accuracy on 4,509 held-out patients, with per-system MSEs <0.16 and
robustness across SOFA-based severity strata. External validation on 22,689 ICU
patients from two hospitals showed moderate degradation under distribution
shifts with stable simulation. Organ-Agents faithfully reproduces critical
multi-system events (e.g., hypotension, hyperlactatemia, hypoxemia) with
coherent timing and phase progression. Evaluation by 15 critical care
physicians confirmed realism and physiological plausibility (mean Likert
ratings 3.9 and 3.7). Organ-Agents also enables counterfactual simulations
under alternative sepsis treatment strategies, generating trajectories and
APACHE II scores aligned with matched real-world patients. In downstream early
warning tasks, classifiers trained on synthetic data showed minimal AUROC drops
(<0.04), indicating preserved decision-relevant patterns. These results
position Organ-Agents as a credible, interpretable, and generalizable digital
twin for precision diagnosis, treatment simulation, and hypothesis testing in
critical care.

Motivation: 现有的事件响应决策支持框架需要详细的系统模型，但在实际网络攻击中信息往往不完整或不准确，限制了其实用性。

Method: 提出MOBAL方法：通过贝叶斯学习迭代修正模型猜想，将推测模型量化为有限马尔可夫模型，并利用动态规划进行在线响应规划。

Result: 理论证明贝叶斯学习相对于信息反馈具有渐近一致性，建立了模型误规范和量化误差的界限。在CAGE-2基准测试中表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MOBAL方法能够有效处理模型不准确的情况，提高了网络事件响应的适应性和鲁棒性，为实际应用提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Effective responses to cyberattacks require fast decisions, even when
information about the attack is incomplete or inaccurate. However, most
decision-support frameworks for incident response rely on a detailed system
model that describes the incident, which restricts their practical utility. In
this paper, we address this limitation and present an online method for
incident response planning under model misspecification, which we call MOBAL:
Misspecified Online Bayesian Learning. MOBAL iteratively refines a conjecture
about the model through Bayesian learning as new information becomes available,
which facilitates model adaptation as the incident unfolds. To determine
effective responses online, we quantize the conjectured model into a finite
Markov model, which enables efficient response planning through dynamic
programming. We prove that Bayesian learning is asymptotically consistent with
respect to the information feedback. Additionally, we establish bounds on
misspecification and quantization errors. Experiments on the CAGE-2 benchmark
show that MOBAL outperforms the state of the art in terms of adaptability and
robustness to model misspecification.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 挑战扩散模型需要大量时间步数的传统假设，探索用更少的潜在状态实现相同甚至更好的性能，以提升训练效率。

Method: 1. 精心选择噪声调度方案；2. 使用少量潜在状态（T~32）训练；3. 进一步推进到单个潜在状态的完全解耦；4. 结合多个独立训练的单潜在状态模型生成高质量样本。

Result: 1. 少量潜在状态模型性能与大量状态模型相当；2. 单潜在状态解耦模型能生成高质量样本；3. 在多个数据集上实现4-6倍的加速收敛。

Conclusion: 扩散模型不需要大量时间步数，通过优化噪声调度和状态解耦，可以显著提高训练效率而不损失生成质量。

Abstract: We challenge a fundamental assumption of diffusion models, namely, that a
large number of latent-states or time-steps is required for training so that
the reverse generative process is close to a Gaussian. We first show that with
careful selection of a noise schedule, diffusion models trained over a small
number of latent states (i.e. $T \sim 32$) match the performance of models
trained over a much large number of latent states ($T \sim 1,000$). Second, we
push this limit (on the minimum number of latent states required) to a single
latent-state, which we refer to as complete disentanglement in T-space. We show
that high quality samples can be easily generated by the disentangled model
obtained by combining several independently trained single latent-state models.
We provide extensive experiments to show that the proposed disentangled model
provides 4-6$\times$ faster convergence measured across a variety of metrics on
two different datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 可穿戴传感器产生的复杂纵向数据流虽提供个性化健康监测机会，但从中提取可执行洞察面临挑战。需要一种能够探索"假如"场景的方法，以理解生活方式选择对个体的潜在影响。

Method: 首先通过多模态相似性分析将个体数据集与相似患者数据进行增帆，然后使用时序PC算法发现预测关系，建模时间t-1处变量对时间t生理变化的影响。基于这些关系训练梯度提升机器来量化个体特异效应，最后通过反事实引擎投影假想干预下的生理轨迹。

Conclusion: 这项工作提供了一种探索个性化健康动态和生成关于个体对生活方式改变响应假设的工具，为个性化健康监测和干预效果预测提供了新的技术方法。

Abstract: Wearable sensor data offer opportunities for personalized health monitoring,
yet deriving actionable insights from their complex, longitudinal data streams
is challenging. This paper introduces a framework to learn personalized
counterfactual models from multivariate wearable data. This enables exploring
what-if scenarios to understand potential individual-specific outcomes of
lifestyle choices. Our approach first augments individual datasets with data
from similar patients via multi-modal similarity analysis. We then use a
temporal PC (Peter-Clark) algorithm adaptation to discover predictive
relationships, modeling how variables at time t-1 influence physiological
changes at time t. Gradient Boosting Machines are trained on these discovered
relationships to quantify individual-specific effects. These models drive a
counterfactual engine projecting physiological trajectories under hypothetical
interventions (e.g., activity or sleep changes). We evaluate the framework via
one-step-ahead predictive validation and by assessing the plausibility and
impact of interventions. Evaluation showed reasonable predictive accuracy
(e.g., mean heart rate MAE 4.71 bpm) and high counterfactual plausibility
(median 0.9643). Crucially, these interventions highlighted significant
inter-individual variability in response to hypothetical lifestyle changes,
showing the framework's potential for personalized insights. This work provides
a tool to explore personalized health dynamics and generate hypotheses on
individual responses to lifestyle changes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有符号回归基准测试过度强调恢复特定表达式形式，依赖计算机代数系统评估成功，且在发现表达式后仍继续搜索，存在效率问题。

Method: 使用SRSD基准问题，引入精心策划的可接受表达式列表和回调机制实现早期终止，对SymbolicRegression.jl和TiSR两个软件包进行基准测试。

Result: SymbolicRegression.jl的重新发现率从26.7%提升至44.7%，计算开销减少41.2%；TiSR的重新发现率为69.4%，时间节省63%。

Conclusion: 新的基准测试方法能有效提高符号回归算法的测试效率和重新发现率，为符号回归研究提供了更好的评估框架。

Abstract: Symbolic regression (SR) uncovers mathematical models from data. Several
benchmarks have been proposed to compare the performance of SR algorithms.
However, existing ground-truth rediscovery benchmarks overemphasize the
recovery of "the one" expression form or rely solely on computer algebra
systems (such as SymPy) to assess success. Furthermore, existing benchmarks
continue the expression search even after its discovery. We improve upon these
issues by introducing curated lists of acceptable expressions, and a callback
mechanism for early termination. As a starting point, we use the symbolic
regression for scientific discovery (SRSD) benchmark problems proposed by
Yoshitomo et al., and benchmark the two SR packages SymbolicRegression.jl and
TiSR. The new benchmarking method increases the rediscovery rate of
SymbolicRegression.jl from 26.7%, as reported by Yoshitomo et at., to 44.7%.
Performing the benchmark takes 41.2% less computational expense. TiSR's
rediscovery rate is 69.4%, while performing the benchmark saves 63% time.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于反事实生成的基准选择方法，用于医学深度学习模型的可解释性分析，解决了传统基准选择在医学场景中的语义无意义问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学深度学习模型的可解释性至关重要，但现有路径归因方法（如积分梯度）依赖于表示特征缺失的基准输入。传统基准（如全零输入）在医学上下文中往往语义无意义，因为缺失本身可能具有信息价值。

Method: 提出反事实引导的方法，使用临床正常但与输入接近的反事实作为基准，更准确地表示医学数据中有意义的特征缺失。采用变分自编码器生成反事实基准，但方法对生成模型具有通用性。

Result: 在三个不同的医学数据集上评估，实证表明反事实基准相比标准基准选择能产生更忠实和医学相关的归因结果。

Conclusion: 反事实基准选择为医学深度学习模型的可解释性提供了更准确和临床相关的特征归因方法，解决了传统基准在医学场景中的局限性。

Abstract: The explainability of deep learning models remains a significant challenge,
particularly in the medical domain where interpretable outputs are critical for
clinical trust and transparency. Path attribution methods such as Integrated
Gradients rely on a baseline input representing the absence of relevant
features ("missingness"). Commonly used baselines, such as all-zero inputs, are
often semantically meaningless, especially in medical contexts where
missingness can itself be informative. While alternative baseline choices have
been explored, existing methods lack a principled approach to dynamically
select baselines tailored to each input. In this work, we examine the notion of
missingness in the medical setting, analyze its implications for baseline
selection, and introduce a counterfactual-guided approach to address the
limitations of conventional baselines. We argue that a clinically normal but
input-close counterfactual represents a more accurate representation of a
meaningful absence of features in medical data. To implement this, we use a
Variational Autoencoder to generate counterfactual baselines, though our
concept is generative-model-agnostic and can be applied with any suitable
counterfactual method. We evaluate the approach on three distinct medical data
sets and empirically demonstrate that counterfactual baselines yield more
faithful and medically relevant attributions compared to standard baseline
choices.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型容易产生幻觉，现有基于语义熵的不确定性估计方法依赖后softmax概率，无法捕捉模型内在不确定性，在某些场景下效果不佳。

Method: 提出Semantic Energy框架，利用倒数第二层logits的固有置信度，结合语义聚类和玻尔兹曼能量分布来估计不确定性。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，Semantic Energy显著改善了幻觉检测和不确定性估计性能。

Conclusion: Semantic Energy为下游应用（如幻觉检测）提供了更可靠的不确定性信号，优于现有的语义熵方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are being increasingly deployed in real-world
applications, but they remain susceptible to hallucinations, which produce
fluent yet incorrect responses and lead to erroneous decision-making.
Uncertainty estimation is a feasible approach to detect such hallucinations.
For example, semantic entropy estimates uncertainty by considering the semantic
diversity across multiple sampled responses, thus identifying hallucinations.
However, semantic entropy relies on post-softmax probabilities and fails to
capture the model's inherent uncertainty, causing it to be ineffective in
certain scenarios. To address this issue, we introduce Semantic Energy, a novel
uncertainty estimation framework that leverages the inherent confidence of LLMs
by operating directly on logits of penultimate layer. By combining semantic
clustering with a Boltzmann-inspired energy distribution, our method better
captures uncertainty in cases where semantic entropy fails. Experiments across
multiple benchmarks show that Semantic Energy significantly improves
hallucination detection and uncertainty estimation, offering more reliable
signals for downstream applications such as hallucination detection.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文针对高斯过程模型提出了一种二次时间复杂度的精确Shapley值计算方法，解决了传统方法指数级计算复杂度的问题，为概率模型提供了可扩展且包含不确定性的解释方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Shapley值作为特征重要性归因的权威方法，在计算上面临指数级复杂度挑战，特别是在概率模型（如高斯过程）中，由于输出是随机变量而非点估计，需要额外计算高阶矩，使得实际应用受到严重限制。

Method: 针对FANOVA GP这类重要高斯过程模型，利用闭式随机Möbius表示和受牛顿恒等式启发的递归算法，分别定义了随机合作游戏和基于方差的确定性值函数，实现了局部和全局解释的精确Shapley值二次时间计算。

Result: 成功实现了在二次时间内计算精确的Shapley值，能够同时捕捉期望贡献和不确定性，量化每个特征对模型整体敏感性的贡献，并通过实证研究验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该研究显著提升了可解释AI的实用性，为结构化概率模型提供了更可扩展、公理上合理且包含不确定性感知的解释方法，解决了Shapley值计算的核心瓶颈问题。

Abstract: Shapley values are widely recognized as a principled method for attributing
importance to input features in machine learning. However, the exact
computation of Shapley values scales exponentially with the number of features,
severely limiting the practical application of this powerful approach. The
challenge is further compounded when the predictive model is probabilistic - as
in Gaussian processes (GPs) - where the outputs are random variables rather
than point estimates, necessitating additional computational effort in modeling
higher-order moments. In this work, we demonstrate that for an important class
of GPs known as FANOVA GP, which explicitly models all main effects and
interactions, *exact* Shapley attributions for both local and global
explanations can be computed in *quadratic time*. For local, instance-wise
explanations, we define a stochastic cooperative game over function components
and compute the exact stochastic Shapley value in quadratic time only,
capturing both the expected contribution and uncertainty. For global
explanations, we introduce a deterministic, variance-based value function and
compute exact Shapley values that quantify each feature's contribution to the
model's overall sensitivity. Our methods leverage a closed-form (stochastic)
M\"{o}bius representation of the FANOVA decomposition and introduce recursive
algorithms, inspired by Newton's identities, to efficiently compute the mean
and variance of Shapley values. Our work enhances the utility of explainable
AI, as demonstrated by empirical studies, by providing more scalable,
axiomatically sound, and uncertainty-aware explanations for predictions
generated by structured probabilistic models.

Abstract: This study proposes an anomaly detection method based on the Transformer
architecture with integrated multiscale feature perception, aiming to address
the limitations of temporal modeling and scale-aware feature representation in
cloud service environments. The method first employs an improved Transformer
module to perform temporal modeling on high-dimensional monitoring data, using
a self-attention mechanism to capture long-range dependencies and contextual
semantics. Then, a multiscale feature construction path is introduced to
extract temporal features at different granularities through downsampling and
parallel encoding. An attention-weighted fusion module is designed to
dynamically adjust the contribution of each scale to the final decision,
enhancing the model's robustness in anomaly pattern modeling. In the input
modeling stage, standardized multidimensional time series are constructed,
covering core signals such as CPU utilization, memory usage, and task
scheduling states, while positional encoding is used to strengthen the model's
temporal awareness. A systematic experimental setup is designed to evaluate
performance, including comparative experiments and hyperparameter sensitivity
analysis, focusing on the impact of optimizers, learning rates, anomaly ratios,
and noise levels. Experimental results show that the proposed method
outperforms mainstream baseline models in key metrics, including precision,
recall, AUC, and F1-score, and maintains strong stability and detection
performance under various perturbation conditions, demonstrating its superior
capability in complex cloud environments.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of road user movement is increasingly required by many
applications ranging from advanced driver assistance systems to autonomous
driving, and especially crucial for road safety. Even though most traffic
accident fatalities account to bicycles, they have received little attention,
as previous work focused mainly on pedestrians and motorized vehicles. In this
work, we present the Great GATsBi, a domain-knowledge-based, hybrid, multimodal
trajectory prediction framework for bicycles. The model incorporates both
physics-based modeling (inspired by motorized vehicles) and social-based
modeling (inspired by pedestrian movements) to explicitly account for the dual
nature of bicycle movement. The social interactions are modeled with a graph
attention network, and include decayed historical, but also anticipated, future
trajectory data of a bicycles neighborhood, following recent insights from
psychological and social studies. The results indicate that the proposed
ensemble of physics models -- performing well in the short-term predictions --
and social models -- performing well in the long-term predictions -- exceeds
state-of-the-art performance. We also conducted a controlled mass-cycling
experiment to demonstrate the framework's performance when forecasting bicycle
trajectories and modeling social interactions with road users.

Conclusion: 验证了正交多项式基在深度强化学习中的潜力，同时强调了模型复杂度选择的重要性

Abstract: The performance of Deep Q-Networks (DQN) is critically dependent on the
ability of its underlying neural network to accurately approximate the
action-value function. Standard function approximators, such as multi-layer
perceptrons, may struggle to efficiently represent the complex value landscapes
inherent in many reinforcement learning problems. This paper introduces a novel
architecture, the Chebyshev-DQN (Ch-DQN), which integrates a Chebyshev
polynomial basis into the DQN framework to create a more effective feature
representation. By leveraging the powerful function approximation properties of
Chebyshev polynomials, we hypothesize that the Ch-DQN can learn more
efficiently and achieve higher performance. We evaluate our proposed model on
the CartPole-v1 benchmark and compare it against a standard DQN with a
comparable number of parameters. Our results demonstrate that the Ch-DQN with a
moderate polynomial degree (N=4) achieves significantly better asymptotic
performance, outperforming the baseline by approximately 39\%. However, we also
find that the choice of polynomial degree is a critical hyperparameter, as a
high degree (N=8) can be detrimental to learning. This work validates the
potential of using orthogonal polynomial bases in deep reinforcement learning
while also highlighting the trade-offs involved in model complexity.

Motivation: 联邦学习中数据异构性导致性能下降，除了已知的客户端漂移外，跨设备联邦学习中由于部分客户端参与还会产生周期漂移问题，这种漂移比客户端漂移更具危害性但尚未得到充分研究。

Result: 理论分析表明方法能减少模型更新方差，大量实验证明在跨设备非独立同分布数据设置下优于其他方法。

Conclusion: 周期漂移是跨设备联邦学习中一个重要但被忽视的问题，FedEve框架能有效缓解周期漂移和客户端漂移的负面影响，提升模型性能。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a machine learning paradigm that allows multiple
clients to collaboratively train a shared model without exposing their private
data. Data heterogeneity is a fundamental challenge in FL, which can result in
poor convergence and performance degradation. Client drift has been recognized
as one of the factors contributing to this issue resulting from the multiple
local updates in FedAvg. However, in cross-device FL, a different form of drift
arises due to the partial client participation, but it has not been studied
well. This drift, we referred as period drift, occurs as participating clients
at each communication round may exhibit distinct data distribution that
deviates from that of all clients. It could be more harmful than client drift
since the optimization objective shifts with every round.
  In this paper, we investigate the interaction between period drift and client
drift, finding that period drift can have a particularly detrimental effect on
cross-device FL as the degree of data heterogeneity increases. To tackle these
issues, we propose a predict-observe framework and present an instantiated
method, FedEve, where these two types of drift can compensate each other to
mitigate their overall impact. We provide theoretical evidence that our
approach can reduce the variance of model updates. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method outperforms alternatives on non-iid data in
cross-device settings.

### [201] [Adaptively Robust LLM Inference Optimization under Prediction Uncertainty](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14544)
*Zixi Chen,Yinyu Ye,Zijie Zhou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 这篇论文研究大语言模型推理优化调度策略，通过机器学习预测输出长度来最小化延迟。提出了一种保守算法和一种自适应算法，后者在保证性能的同时避免内存溢出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型推理是一种在线多任务服务过程，能耗较大。关键挑战在于输出长度的不确定性，这会影响内存使用和处理时间。需要提高调度效率并降低能耗。

Method: 提出两种算法：1) 保守算法α_max，基于预测输出长度上限进行调度；2) 自适应算法α_min，初始使用预测下限并在推理过程中动态精化估计。还证明了α_min算法的竞争比例。

Result: 通过数值模拟展示，α_min算法继续性能接近于后见调度器，显示出其高效性和稳健性。还有一个优势是只需要预测区间的下限，而上限预测通常更难。

Conclusion: 这项研究为LLM推理调度提供了有效解决方案，α_min算法通过动态预测输出长度来平衡性能和内存使用，在实践中表现出艰囍性和高效性。

Abstract: We study the problem of optimizing Large Language Model (LLM) inference
scheduling to minimize total latency. LLM inference is an online and multi-task
service process and also heavily energy consuming by which a pre-trained LLM
processes input requests and generates output tokens sequentially. Therefore,
it is vital to improve its scheduling efficiency and reduce the power
consumption while a great amount of prompt requests are arriving. A key
challenge in LLM inference scheduling is that while the prompt length is known
upon arrival, the output length, which critically impacts memory usage and
processing time, is unknown. To address this uncertainty, we propose algorithms
that leverage machine learning to predict output lengths, assuming the
prediction provides an interval classification (min-max range) for each
request.
  We first design a conservative algorithm, $\mathcal{A}_{\max}$, which
schedules requests based on the upper bound of predicted output lengths to
prevent memory overflow. However, this approach is overly conservative: as
prediction accuracy decreases, performance degrades significantly due to
potential overestimation. To overcome this limitation, we propose
$\mathcal{A}_{\min}$, an adaptive algorithm that initially treats the predicted
lower bound as the output length and dynamically refines this estimate during
inferencing. We prove that $\mathcal{A}_{\min}$ achieves a log-scale
competitive ratio. Through numerical simulations, we demonstrate that
$\mathcal{A}_{\min}$ often performs nearly as well as the hindsight scheduler,
highlighting both its efficiency and robustness in practical scenarios.
Moreover, $\mathcal{A}_{\min}$ relies solely on the lower bound of the
prediction interval--an advantageous design choice since upper bounds on output
length are typically more challenging to predict accurately.

Motivation: 现有分布式SGD算法通常假设固定拓扑和均匀节点贡献，但实验表明这些假设是次优的，动态拓扑和非均匀聚合策略能显著提升性能。

Method: 开发了一个统一的Local-Update SGD框架，支持动态拓扑变化和客户端选择，采用非均匀聚合策略。

Result: 该框架提供了比现有工作改进或匹配的理论收敛保证，实验表明性能显著提升。

Conclusion: 动态拓扑和非均匀聚合策略是分布式SGD的重要改进方向，提出的统一框架为此类算法提供了理论基础和性能保证。

Abstract: One of the most common methods to train machine learning algorithms today is
the stochastic gradient descent (SGD). In a distributed setting, SGD-based
algorithms have been shown to converge theoretically under specific
circumstances. A substantial number of works in the distributed SGD setting
assume a fixed topology for the edge devices. These papers also assume that the
contribution of nodes to the global model is uniform. However, experiments have
shown that such assumptions are suboptimal and a non uniform aggregation
strategy coupled with a dynamically shifting topology and client selection can
significantly improve the performance of such models. This paper details a
unified framework that covers several Local-Update SGD-based distributed
algorithms with dynamic topologies and provides improved or matching
theoretical guarantees on convergence compared to existing work.

Method: 开发了多种基于不同密度比估计核心的公平性测量方法，并系统比较这些核心算法对公平性测量结果的影响。

Result: 实验结果表明，密度比估计算法的选择会显著影响公平性测量结果，甚至导致对不同算法相对公平性评估的不一致结论。

Abstract: The prevalence of algorithmic bias in Machine Learning (ML)-driven approaches
has inspired growing research on measuring and mitigating bias in the ML
domain. Accordingly, prior research studied how to measure fairness in
regression which is a complex problem. In particular, recent research proposed
to formulate it as a density-ratio estimation problem and relied on a Logistic
Regression-driven probabilistic classifier-based approach to solve it. However,
there are several other methods to estimate a density ratio, and to the best of
our knowledge, prior work did not study the sensitivity of such fairness
measurement methods to the choice of underlying density ratio estimation
algorithm. To fill this gap, this paper develops a set of fairness measurement
methods with various density-ratio estimation cores and thoroughly investigates
how different cores would affect the achieved level of fairness. Our
experimental results show that the choice of density-ratio estimation core
could significantly affect the outcome of fairness measurement method, and
even, generate inconsistent results with respect to the relative fairness of
various algorithms. These observations suggest major issues with density-ratio
estimation based fairness measurement in regression and a need for further
research to enhance their reliability.

TL;DR: DualNILM是一个基于Transformer的多任务学习框架，用于解决带有表后能源（如太阳能板）的非侵入式负荷监测问题，能够同时识别电器状态和注入能量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统NILM方法仅依赖电表数据，但表后能源（如太阳能板和电池存储）的普及使得注入能量会掩盖电器功率特征，导致NILM性能显著下降。

Method: 提出DualNILM框架，结合sequence-to-point和sequence-to-sequence策略，采用Transformer架构捕捉聚合功率消耗模式中的多尺度时间依赖性。

Result: 在包含电器级能耗和能量注入的自收集和合成开源NILM数据集上验证，实验结果表明DualNILM在双任务上保持优异性能，远超传统方法。

Conclusion: DualNILM有效解决了表后能源带来的NILM挑战，通过多任务学习框架实现了准确的电器状态识别和能量注入识别。

Abstract: Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) offers a cost-effective method to obtain
fine-grained appliance-level energy consumption in smart homes and building
applications. However, the increasing adoption of behind-the-meter energy
sources, such as solar panels and battery storage, poses new challenges for
conventional NILM methods that rely solely on at-the-meter data. The injected
energy from the behind-the-meter sources can obscure the power signatures of
individual appliances, leading to a significant decline in NILM performance. To
address this challenge, we present DualNILM, a deep multi-task learning
framework designed for the dual tasks of appliance state recognition and
injected energy identification in NILM. By integrating sequence-to-point and
sequence-to-sequence strategies within a Transformer-based architecture,
DualNILM can effectively capture multi-scale temporal dependencies in the
aggregate power consumption patterns, allowing for accurate appliance state
recognition and energy injection identification. We conduct validation of
DualNILM using both self-collected and synthesized open NILM datasets that
include both appliance-level energy consumption and energy injection. Extensive
experimental results demonstrate that DualNILM maintains an excellent
performance for the dual tasks in NILM, much outperforming conventional
methods.

*Hugo Sales Corrêa,Suryanarayana Sankagiri,Daniel Ratton Figueiredo,Matthias Grossglauser*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了两种统计方法来检验相似性选择中的IIA假设，发现了显著的IIA违背现象，表明需要开发考虑情境效应的新模型


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 相似性选择数据在信息检索和嵌入学习等场景中很常见，但经典度量模型假设的IIA属性是否成立尚未得到充分检验

Method: 提出了两种IIA检验方法：经典拟合优度检验和基于后验预测检查的贝叶斯方法，并设计了专门的数据集来诱发IIA违背

Result: 在两个数据集上都检测到显著的IIA违背，且违背程度相当；人口同质性检验显示违背主要由选择集内的情境效应驱动

Conclusion: 相似性选择中存在IIA违背，需要开发能够考虑情境效应的新模型

Abstract: Similarity choice data occur when humans make choices among alternatives
based on their similarity to a target, e.g., in the context of information
retrieval and in embedding learning settings. Classical metric-based models of
similarity choice assume independence of irrelevant alternatives (IIA), a
property that allows for a simpler formulation. While IIA violations have been
detected in many discrete choice settings, the similarity choice setting has
received scant attention. This is because the target-dependent nature of the
choice complicates IIA testing. We propose two statistical methods to test for
IIA: a classical goodness-of-fit test and a Bayesian counterpart based on the
framework of Posterior Predictive Checks (PPC). This Bayesian approach, our
main technical contribution, quantifies the degree of IIA violation beyond its
mere significance. We curate two datasets: one with choice sets designed to
elicit IIA violations, and another with randomly generated choice sets from the
same item universe. Our tests confirmed significant IIA violations on both
datasets, and notably, we find a comparable degree of violation between them.
Further, we devise a new PPC test for population homogeneity. Results show that
the population is indeed homogenous, suggesting that the IIA violations are
driven by context effects -- specifically, interactions within the choice sets.
These results highlight the need for new similarity choice models that account
for such context effects.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一个模糊增强可解释AI框架(FEXAI)，结合模糊逻辑、机器学习和SHAP分析，用于分析连续下降操作(CDO)性能影响因素，并实现高精度的分类和可解释的规则提取。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 连续下降操作(CDO)具有减少燃油消耗、排放和噪音等优势，但现有研究缺乏对CDO性能影响因素的系统分析，且相关方法缺乏航空领域所需的透明度。

Method: 收集1094个航班的29个特征数据，应用机器学习模型和SHAP分析进行分类和特征重要性排序，然后使用最重要的三个特征构建模糊规则分类器。

Result: 所有模型分类准确率超过90%，识别出平均下降速率、下降段数量和平均航向变化是最重要的预测因子，FEXAI能够提供人类可读的解释规则。

Conclusion: FEXAI方法为运行决策支持提供了新途径，可集成到航空工具中实现实时建议，以保持不同运行条件下的CDO依从性。

Abstract: Continuous Descent Operations (CDO) involve smooth, idle-thrust descents that
avoid level-offs, reducing fuel burn, emissions, and noise while improving
efficiency and passenger comfort. Despite its operational and environmental
benefits, limited research has systematically examined the factors influencing
CDO performance. Moreover, many existing methods in related areas, such as
trajectory optimization, lack the transparency required in aviation, where
explainability is critical for safety and stakeholder trust. This study
addresses these gaps by proposing a Fuzzy-Enhanced Explainable AI (FEXAI)
framework that integrates fuzzy logic with machine learning and SHapley
Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis. For this purpose, a comprehensive
dataset of 29 features, including 11 operational and 18 weather-related
features, was collected from 1,094 flights using Automatic Dependent
Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) data. Machine learning models and SHAP were then
applied to classify flights' CDO adherence levels and rank features by
importance. The three most influential features, as identified by SHAP scores,
were then used to construct a fuzzy rule-based classifier, enabling the
extraction of interpretable fuzzy rules. All models achieved classification
accuracies above 90%, with FEXAI providing meaningful, human-readable rules for
operational users. Results indicated that the average descent rate within the
arrival route, the number of descent segments, and the average change in
directional heading during descent were the strongest predictors of CDO
performance. The FEXAI method proposed in this study presents a novel pathway
for operational decision support and could be integrated into aviation tools to
enable real-time advisories that maintain CDO adherence under varying
operational conditions.

TL;DR: 该研究通过将SNOMED医学术语层次结构映射到双曲空间，生成Poincaré嵌入，并将其整合到深度学习模型中，以改进肺癌发病预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有临床预测模型通常忽略临床概念间的语义关系，本研究旨在通过整合领域特定的语义信息来改善肺癌预测性能。

Method: 从SNOMED分类法构建临床知识图谱，通过黎曼随机梯度下降生成Poincaré嵌入，并将其整合到ResNet和Transformer深度学习架构中。

Result: 使用预训练Poincaré嵌入相比基线模型在区分性能上有适度但一致的提升，ResNet模型在校准方面表现更好，Transformer模型校准稳定性更强。

Conclusion: 将临床知识图谱嵌入双曲空间并整合到深度学习模型中，能够通过保留临床术语的层次结构来改善肺癌预测，展示了数据驱动特征提取与临床知识结合的有效方法。

Abstract: Background: Existing clinical prediction models often represent patient data
using features that ignore the semantic relationships between clinical
concepts. This study integrates domain-specific semantic information by mapping
the SNOMED medical term hierarchy into a low-dimensional hyperbolic space using
Poincar\'e embeddings, with the aim of improving lung cancer onset prediction.
  Methods: Using a retrospective cohort from the Optum EHR dataset, we derived
a clinical knowledge graph from the SNOMED taxonomy and generated Poincar\'e
embeddings via Riemannian stochastic gradient descent. These embeddings were
then incorporated into two deep learning architectures, a ResNet and a
Transformer model. Models were evaluated for discrimination (area under the
receiver operating characteristic curve) and calibration (average absolute
difference between observed and predicted probabilities) performance.
  Results: Incorporating pre-trained Poincar\'e embeddings resulted in modest
and consistent improvements in discrimination performance compared to baseline
models using randomly initialized Euclidean embeddings. ResNet models,
particularly those using a 10-dimensional Poincar\'e embedding, showed enhanced
calibration, whereas Transformer models maintained stable calibration across
configurations.
  Discussion: Embedding clinical knowledge graphs into hyperbolic space and
integrating these representations into deep learning models can improve lung
cancer onset prediction by preserving the hierarchical structure of clinical
terminologies used for prediction. This approach demonstrates a feasible method
for combining data-driven feature extraction with established clinical
knowledge.

TL;DR: Diff-In是一种新的样本影响力近似方法，通过累积连续学习步骤间的影响力差异来估计样本影响力，无需模型凸性假设，计算效率高且精度优于现有方法。


<details>

Motivation: 现有数据影响力分析工具精度不足，往往假设神经网络损失函数是凸的，这限制了方法在实际中的有效应用。

Method: 提出Diff-In方法，将样本影响力定义为连续训练迭代中变化的累积和，使用二阶近似高精度估计差异项，通过计算Hessian矩阵与梯度的乘积来保持计算效率。

Result: 理论分析和大量实验证明Diff-In在多个基准数据集和三个数据中心任务（数据清洗、数据删除、核心集选择）中表现优异，能够扩展到百万级数据点。

Conclusion: Diff-In方法在保持计算效率的同时显著提高了样本影响力估计的准确性，为大规模数据分析和处理提供了有效的工具。

Abstract: Data plays a pivotal role in the groundbreaking advancements in artificial
intelligence. The quantitative analysis of data significantly contributes to
model training, enhancing both the efficiency and quality of data utilization.
However, existing data analysis tools often lag in accuracy. For instance, many
of these tools even assume that the loss function of neural networks is convex.
These limitations make it challenging to implement current methods effectively.
In this paper, we introduce a new formulation to approximate a sample's
influence by accumulating the differences in influence between consecutive
learning steps, which we term Diff-In. Specifically, we formulate the
sample-wise influence as the cumulative sum of its changes/differences across
successive training iterations. By employing second-order approximations, we
approximate these difference terms with high accuracy while eliminating the
need for model convexity required by existing methods. Despite being a
second-order method, Diff-In maintains computational complexity comparable to
that of first-order methods and remains scalable. This efficiency is achieved
by computing the product of the Hessian and gradient, which can be efficiently
approximated using finite differences of first-order gradients. We assess the
approximation accuracy of Diff-In both theoretically and empirically. Our
theoretical analysis demonstrates that Diff-In achieves significantly lower
approximation error compared to existing influence estimators. Extensive
experiments further confirm its superior performance across multiple benchmark
datasets in three data-centric tasks: data cleaning, data deletion, and coreset
selection. Notably, our experiments on data pruning for large-scale
vision-language pre-training show that Diff-In can scale to millions of data
points and outperforms strong baselines.

Motivation: 时间序列预测中的特征工程通常需要手动操作且耗时，现有自动化方法依赖穷举枚举，计算成本高且缺乏领域特定洞察

Method: 结合进化框架和语言模型，使用时序统计度量和特征重要性指标来指导和剪枝特征，语言模型提出上下文相关的特征变换

Result: 实验表明ELATE在不同领域平均提高预测精度8.4%

Conclusion: ELATE有效解决了时间序列特征工程自动化问题，通过进化语言模型框架显著提升了预测性能

Abstract: Time-series prediction involves forecasting future values using machine
learning models. Feature engineering, whereby existing features are transformed
to make new ones, is critical for enhancing model performance, but is often
manual and time-intensive. Existing automation attempts rely on exhaustive
enumeration, which can be computationally costly and lacks domain-specific
insights. We introduce ELATE (Evolutionary Language model for Automated
Time-series Engineering), which leverages a language model within an
evolutionary framework to automate feature engineering for time-series data.
ELATE employs time-series statistical measures and feature importance metrics
to guide and prune features, while the language model proposes new,
contextually relevant feature transformations. Our experiments demonstrate that
ELATE improves forecasting accuracy by an average of 8.4% across various
domains.

TL;DR: Fair-ICD：一种基于反事实数据增强的图神经网络公平性提升方法，通过创建多样化的邻域来学习无偏节点表示，并使用对抗判别器减少预测偏差，在保持高预测性能的同时显著提升公平性指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图神经网络（GNNs）在处理图结构数据时存在基于种族、性别等敏感属性的预测偏差问题，现有方法通过过滤敏感信息可能导致非敏感特征丢失，影响预测准确性和公平性的平衡。

Method: 提出Fair-ICD方法：1）在消息传递前使用反事实数据增强创建多样化邻域；2）从增强图中学习无偏节点表示；3）使用对抗判别器配合传统GNN分类器减少预测偏差。

Result: 在标准数据集上使用三种GNN骨干网络的实验表明，Fair-ICD显著提升了公平性指标，同时保持了较高的预测性能。

Conclusion: Fair-ICD方法在适度条件下能够有效确保GNNs的公平性，为解决图神经网络中的偏差问题提供了一种新的有效途径。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been successful in modeling
graph-structured data. However, similar to other machine learning models, GNNs
can exhibit bias in predictions based on attributes like race and gender.
Moreover, bias in GNNs can be exacerbated by the graph structure and
message-passing mechanisms. Recent cutting-edge methods propose mitigating bias
by filtering out sensitive information from input or representations, like edge
dropping or feature masking. Yet, we argue that such strategies may
unintentionally eliminate non-sensitive features, leading to a compromised
balance between predictive accuracy and fairness. To tackle this challenge, we
present a novel approach utilizing counterfactual data augmentation for bias
mitigation. This method involves creating diverse neighborhoods using
counterfactuals before message passing, facilitating unbiased node
representations learning from the augmented graph. Subsequently, an adversarial
discriminator is employed to diminish bias in predictions by conventional GNN
classifiers. Our proposed technique, Fair-ICD, ensures the fairness of GNNs
under moderate conditions. Experiments on standard datasets using three GNN
backbones demonstrate that Fair-ICD notably enhances fairness metrics while
preserving high predictive performance.

Conclusion: CES2-GAD通过谱分析和因果边分离有效解决了异配图中的异常检测问题，填补了谱域异配问题研究的空白

Abstract: In the real world, anomalous entities often add more legitimate connections
while hiding direct links with other anomalous entities, leading to
heterophilic structures in anomalous networks that most GNN-based techniques
fail to address. Several works have been proposed to tackle this issue in the
spatial domain. However, these methods overlook the complex relationships
between node structure encoding, node features, and their contextual
environment and rely on principled guidance, research on solving spectral
domain heterophilic problems remains limited. This study analyzes the spectral
distribution of nodes with different heterophilic degrees and discovers that
the heterophily of anomalous nodes causes the spectral energy to shift from low
to high frequencies. To address the above challenges, we propose a spectral
neural network CES2-GAD based on causal edge separation for anomaly detection
on heterophilic graphs. Firstly, CES2-GAD will separate the original graph into
homophilic and heterophilic edges using causal interventions. Subsequently,
various hybrid-spectrum filters are used to capture signals from the segmented
graphs. Finally, representations from multiple signals are concatenated and
input into a classifier to predict anomalies. Extensive experiments with
real-world datasets have proven the effectiveness of the method we proposed.

Abstract: In many real-world scenarios, acquiring all features of a data instance can
be expensive or impractical due to monetary cost, latency, or privacy concerns.
Active Feature Acquisition (AFA) addresses this challenge by dynamically
selecting a subset of informative features for each data instance, trading
predictive performance against acquisition cost. While numerous methods have
been proposed for AFA, ranging from greedy information-theoretic strategies to
non-myopic reinforcement learning approaches, fair and systematic evaluation of
these methods has been hindered by the lack of standardized benchmarks. In this
paper, we introduce AFABench, the first benchmark framework for AFA. Our
benchmark includes a diverse set of synthetic and real-world datasets, supports
a wide range of acquisition policies, and provides a modular design that
enables easy integration of new methods and tasks. We implement and evaluate
representative algorithms from all major categories, including static, greedy,
and reinforcement learning-based approaches. To test the lookahead capabilities
of AFA policies, we introduce a novel synthetic dataset, AFAContext, designed
to expose the limitations of greedy selection. Our results highlight key
trade-offs between different AFA strategies and provide actionable insights for
future research. The benchmark code is available at:

Abstract: Reasoning graphs from Large Language Models (LLMs) are often misaligned with
downstream visual tasks such as video anomaly detection (VAD). Existing Graph
Structure Refinement (GSR) methods are ill-suited for these novel, dataset-less
graphs. We introduce Data-driven GSR (D-GSR), a new paradigm that directly
optimizes graph structure using downstream task data, and propose MissionHD, a
hyperdimensional computing (HDC) framework to operationalize it. MissionHD uses
an efficient encode-decode process to refine the graph, guided by the
downstream task signal. Experiments on challenging VAD and VAR benchmarks show
significant performance improvements when using our refined graphs, validating
our approach as an effective pre-processing step.

TL;DR: CMCM-DLM是一个基于扩散语言模型的跨模态分子生成方法，能够在无需重新训练的情况下扩展预训练模型以支持多模态约束


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SMILES扩散模型仅支持单模态约束，需要为每个新约束重新训练模型，而实际应用中需要处理多模态约束且约束可能随时间变化

Method: 基于预训练扩散模型，添加两个可训练模块（结构控制模块SCM和性质控制模块PCM），分两阶段生成：第一阶段注入结构约束锚定分子骨架，第二阶段引入性质约束精炼分子

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验证明了方法的有效性和适应性

Conclusion: CMCM-DLM在药物发现应用的分子生成方面取得了显著进展

Abstract: Current SMILES-based diffusion models for molecule generation typically
support only unimodal constraint. They inject conditioning signals at the start
of the training process and require retraining a new model from scratch
whenever the constraint changes. However, real-world applications often involve
multiple constraints across different modalities, and additional constraints
may emerge over the course of a study. This raises a challenge: how to extend a
pre-trained diffusion model not only to support cross-modality constraints but
also to incorporate new ones without retraining. To tackle this problem, we
propose the Cross-Modality Controlled Molecule Generation with Diffusion
Language Model (CMCM-DLM), demonstrated by two distinct cross modalities:
molecular structure and chemical properties. Our approach builds upon a
pre-trained diffusion model, incorporating two trainable modules, the Structure
Control Module (SCM) and the Property Control Module (PCM), and operates in two
distinct phases during the generation process. In Phase I, we employs the SCM
to inject structural constraints during the early diffusion steps, effectively
anchoring the molecular backbone. Phase II builds on this by further
introducing PCM to guide the later stages of inference to refine the generated
molecules, ensuring their chemical properties match the specified targets.
Experimental results on multiple datasets demonstrate the efficiency and
adaptability of our approach, highlighting CMCM-DLM's significant advancement
in molecular generation for drug discovery applications.

TL;DR: HERAKLES是一个分层自目标AI代理框架，通过将已掌握的目标编译到低级策略中，动态扩展高级策略可用的子目标空间，利用LLM作为高级控制器来处理不断演化的目标复杂性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决开放环境中AI代理需要高效学习日益复杂、抽象和异构目标的问题，现有方法使用专家定义的子目标空间和预训练低级策略，无法适应目标空间自然多样化的开放场景。

Method: 采用两层分层架构：1) 将已掌握目标编译到小型快速神经网络执行的低级策略中；2) 使用大型语言模型作为高级控制器，利用其目标分解和泛化能力在演化的子目标空间上操作。

Result: 在Crafter环境中验证显示，HERAKLES能有效随目标复杂性扩展，通过技能编译提高样本效率，并使代理能够随时间稳健适应新挑战。

Conclusion: HERAKLES框架通过动态技能编译和LLM高级控制，为开放环境中的分层自目标学习提供了可扩展的解决方案，能够处理不断增长的目标复杂性。

Abstract: Open-ended AI agents need to be able to learn efficiently goals of increasing
complexity, abstraction and heterogeneity over their lifetime. Beyond sampling
efficiently their own goals, autotelic agents specifically need to be able to
keep the growing complexity of goals under control, limiting the associated
growth in sample and computational complexity. To adress this challenge, recent
approaches have leveraged hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) and
language, capitalizing on its compositional and combinatorial generalization
capabilities to acquire temporally extended reusable behaviours. Existing
approaches use expert defined spaces of subgoals over which they instantiate a
hierarchy, and often assume pre-trained associated low-level policies. Such
designs are inadequate in open-ended scenarios, where goal spaces naturally
diversify across a broad spectrum of difficulties. We introduce HERAKLES, a
framework that enables a two-level hierarchical autotelic agent to continuously
compile mastered goals into the low-level policy, executed by a small, fast
neural network, dynamically expanding the set of subgoals available to the
high-level policy. We train a Large Language Model (LLM) to serve as the
high-level controller, exploiting its strengths in goal decomposition and
generalization to operate effectively over this evolving subgoal space. We
evaluate HERAKLES in the open-ended Crafter environment and show that it scales
effectively with goal complexity, improves sample efficiency through skill
compilation, and enables the agent to adapt robustly to novel challenges over
time.

Motivation: 当前治疗性肽设计面临序列空间巨大、实验数据有限、生成模型可解释性差等挑战，需要开发能够进行可解释设计选择的多属性优化方法。

Method: 整合大型语言模型(LLMs)与思维链(CoT)监督微调和强化学习(RL)，在序列生成过程中显式推理单体级修改，使用平衡化学有效性和属性改进的奖励函数指导模型探索。

Result: PepThink-R1生成的环肽在亲脂性、稳定性和暴露度方面显著提升，在优化成功率和可解释性方面优于现有通用LLMs和领域特定基线模型。

Conclusion: 这是首个结合显式推理与RL驱动属性控制的基于LLM的肽设计框架，为治疗发现提供了可靠且透明的肽优化方法。

Abstract: Designing therapeutic peptides with tailored properties is hindered by the
vastness of sequence space, limited experimental data, and poor
interpretability of current generative models. To address these challenges, we
introduce PepThink-R1, a generative framework that integrates large language
models (LLMs) with chain-of-thought (CoT) supervised fine-tuning and
reinforcement learning (RL). Unlike prior approaches, PepThink-R1 explicitly
reasons about monomer-level modifications during sequence generation, enabling
interpretable design choices while optimizing for multiple pharmacological
properties. Guided by a tailored reward function balancing chemical validity
and property improvements, the model autonomously explores diverse sequence
variants. We demonstrate that PepThink-R1 generates cyclic peptides with
significantly enhanced lipophilicity, stability, and exposure, outperforming
existing general LLMs (e.g., GPT-5) and domain-specific baseline in both
optimization success and interpretability. To our knowledge, this is the first
LLM-based peptide design framework that combines explicit reasoning with
RL-driven property control, marking a step toward reliable and transparent
peptide optimization for therapeutic discovery.

Motivation: 现有联邦蒸馏方法需要复杂的知识共享策略和昂贵的统计密度比估计，服务器端过滤引入延迟，需要更高效、轻量级的解决方案。

Method: 提出EdgeFD方法，使用KMeans密度比估计器有效过滤客户端的内分布和外分布代理数据，无需预训练教师模型和服务器端过滤。

Result: 在各种数据分布场景下（强非IID、弱非IID、IID），EdgeFD优于现有方法，准确率接近IID场景，计算开销显著降低。

Conclusion: EdgeFD提高了联邦蒸馏的可扩展性和实际应用性，特别适合资源受限的边缘设备部署。

Abstract: Federated distillation has emerged as a promising collaborative machine
learning approach, offering enhanced privacy protection and reduced
communication compared to traditional federated learning by exchanging model
outputs (soft logits) rather than full model parameters. However, existing
methods employ complex selective knowledge-sharing strategies that require
clients to identify in-distribution proxy data through computationally
expensive statistical density ratio estimators. Additionally, server-side
filtering of ambiguous knowledge introduces latency to the process. To address
these challenges, we propose a robust, resource-efficient EdgeFD method that
reduces the complexity of the client-side density ratio estimation and removes
the need for server-side filtering. EdgeFD introduces an efficient KMeans-based
density ratio estimator for effectively filtering both in-distribution and
out-of-distribution proxy data on clients, significantly improving the quality
of knowledge sharing. We evaluate EdgeFD across diverse practical scenarios,
including strong non-IID, weak non-IID, and IID data distributions on clients,
without requiring a pre-trained teacher model on the server for knowledge
distillation. Experimental results demonstrate that EdgeFD outperforms
state-of-the-art methods, consistently achieving accuracy levels close to IID
scenarios even under heterogeneous and challenging conditions. The
significantly reduced computational overhead of the KMeans-based estimator is
suitable for deployment on resource-constrained edge devices, thereby enhancing
the scalability and real-world applicability of federated distillation. The
code is available online for reproducibility.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了挤压扩散模型(SDM)，通过各向异性缩放噪声而非传统各向同性高斯噪声，在数据主成分方向上调整噪声分布，在多个数据集上实现了FID指标15%的提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受量子压缩态根据海森堡不确定性原理重新分配不确定性的启发，传统扩散模型使用各向同性高斯噪声忽略了数据结构信息，作者希望通过数据依赖的噪声缩放来帮助模型学习重要特征。

Method: 提出了两种配置：(i)海森堡扩散模型-在主轴上缩放噪声并在正交方向上进行逆缩放；(ii)标准SDM变体-仅缩放主轴。意外发现适度反压缩(增加主轴方差)效果更好。

Result: 在CIFAR-10/100和CelebA-64数据集上，轻度反压缩 consistently 将FID提升达15%，并将精度-召回边界推向更高召回率。

Conclusion: 简单的数据感知噪声整形可以在不改变架构的情况下带来稳健的生成性能提升，证明了数据相关噪声设计的重要性。

Abstract: Diffusion models typically inject isotropic Gaussian noise, disregarding
structure in the data. Motivated by the way quantum squeezed states
redistribute uncertainty according to the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, we
introduce Squeezed Diffusion Models (SDM), which scale noise anisotropically
along the principal component of the training distribution. As squeezing
enhances the signal-to-noise ratio in physics, we hypothesize that scaling
noise in a data-dependent manner can better assist diffusion models in learning
important data features. We study two configurations: (i) a Heisenberg
diffusion model that compensates the scaling on the principal axis with inverse
scaling on orthogonal directions and (ii) a standard SDM variant that scales
only the principal axis. Counterintuitively, on CIFAR-10/100 and CelebA-64,
mild antisqueezing - i.e. increasing variance on the principal axis -
consistently improves FID by up to 15% and shifts the precision-recall frontier
toward higher recall. Our results demonstrate that simple, data-aware noise
shaping can deliver robust generative gains without architectural changes.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为"上下文引导"的新方法，通过主动指导特征形成过程来解决压缩距离在复杂聚类任务中难以与特定任务对齐的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 压缩距离虽然能够灵活地测量相似性，但因其特征是从数据中衍生而非预定义，在复杂聚类或分类设置中往往难以与具体任务对齐。

Method: 通过系统分析每个对象在聚类框架内如何影响关系上下文，主动"引导"特征形成过程，生成定制化的嵌入空间来隔离和放大类别区分信息。

Result: 在文本和真实世界音频等多种异构数据集上的实验验证了上下文引导方法的鲁棒性和通用性。

Conclusion: 该方法标志着压缩距离应用的根本转变：从仅仅发现内在数据结构转变为主动塑造针对特定目标定制的特征空间。

Abstract: Compression-based distances (CD) offer a flexible and domain-agnostic means
of measuring similarity by identifying implicit information through
redundancies between data objects. However, as similarity features are derived
from the data, rather than defined as an input, it often proves difficult to
align with the task at hand, particularly in complex clustering or
classification settings. To address this issue, we introduce "context
steering," a novel methodology that actively guides the feature-shaping
process. Instead of passively accepting the emergent data structure (typically
a hierarchy derived from clustering CDs), our approach "steers" the process by
systematically analyzing how each object influences the relational context
within a clustering framework. This process generates a custom-tailored
embedding that isolates and amplifies class-distinctive information. We
validate the capabilities of this strategy using Normalized Compression
Distance (NCD) and Relative Compression Distance (NRC) with common hierarchical
clustering, providing an effective alternative to common transductive methods.
Experimental results across heterogeneous datasets-from text to real-world
audio-validate the robustness and generality of context steering, marking a
fundamental shift in their application: from merely discovering inherent data
structures to actively shaping a feature space tailored to a specific
objective.

Conclusion: 损失感知的数据增帽和矢量化精炼技术为高效、有效的模型压缩提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: Model distillation enables the transfer of knowledge from large-scale models
to compact student models, facilitating deployment in resource-constrained
environments. However, conventional distillation approaches often suffer from
computational overhead and limited generalization. We propose a novel adaptive
distillation framework that dynamically augments training data in regions of
high student model loss. Using UMAP-based dimensionality reduction and nearest
neighbor sampling, our method identifies underperforming regions in the
embedding space and generates targeted synthetic examples to guide student
learning. To further improve efficiency, we introduce a lightweight
teacher-student interface that bypasses the teacher's input layer, enabling
direct distillation on vectorized representations. Experiments across standard
NLP benchmarks demonstrate that our 66M-parameter student model consistently
matches or surpasses established baselines, achieving 91.2% on QNLI and 92.3%
on SST-2, while training with fewer epochs. These results highlight the promise
of loss-aware data augmentation and vectorized distillation for efficient and
effective model compression.

Abstract: Despite the high demand for manually annotated image data, managing complex
and costly annotation projects remains under-discussed. This is partly due to
the fact that leading such projects requires dealing with a set of diverse and
interconnected challenges which often fall outside the expertise of specific
domain experts, leaving practical guidelines scarce. These challenges range
widely from data collection to resource allocation and recruitment, from
mitigation of biases to effective training of the annotators. This paper
provides a domain-agnostic preparation guide for annotation projects, with a
focus on scientific imagery. Drawing from the authors' extensive experience in
managing a large manual annotation project, it addresses fundamental concepts
including success measures, annotation subjects, project goals, data
availability, and essential team roles. Additionally, it discusses various
human biases and recommends tools and technologies to improve annotation
quality and efficiency. The goal is to encourage further research and
frameworks for creating a comprehensive knowledge base to reduce the costs of
manual annotation projects across various fields.

Motivation: 传统生成模型引导方法通过修改概率流向量场来实现，但这种方法可能不够灵活。本文提出通过直接修改源分布来保持预训练向量场完整，提供更灵活的引导方式。

Method: SGFM框架保持预训练向量场不变，直接修改源分布，将引导问题转化为从源分布采样的明确定义问题。理论证明能准确恢复目标分布，并提供近似采样器和向量场下的Wasserstein误差界限。

Result: 理论证明SGFM能准确恢复目标分布，实验在合成2D基准、图像数据集和物理信息生成任务上验证了框架的有效性和灵活性，允许用户根据具体问题灵活选择采样方法。

Conclusion: SGFM框架提供了一种灵活且理论保证的生成模型引导方法，保持预训练向量场完整，通过源分布修改实现精确引导，与最优流匹配模型良好集成。

Abstract: Guidance of generative models is typically achieved by modifying the
probability flow vector field through the addition of a guidance field. In this
paper, we instead propose the Source-Guided Flow Matching (SGFM) framework,
which modifies the source distribution directly while keeping the pre-trained
vector field intact. This reduces the guidance problem to a well-defined
problem of sampling from the source distribution. We theoretically show that
SGFM recovers the desired target distribution exactly. Furthermore, we provide
bounds on the Wasserstein error for the generated distribution when using an
approximate sampler of the source distribution and an approximate vector field.
The key benefit of our approach is that it allows the user to flexibly choose
the sampling method depending on their specific problem. To illustrate this, we
systematically compare different sampling methods and discuss conditions for
asymptotically exact guidance. Moreover, our framework integrates well with
optimal flow matching models since the straight transport map generated by the
vector field is preserved. Experimental results on synthetic 2D benchmarks,
image datasets, and physics-informed generative tasks demonstrate the
effectiveness and flexibility of the proposed framework.

Result: 在8个基准数据集上的实验结果表明，CoEBA方法显著优于其他最先进的链接预测模型

Conclusion: 该研究为对比学习在链接预测中的应用提供了首个正式理论分析，并通过EBA和新的对比损失有效提升了模型性能

Abstract: Link prediction is one of the most fundamental tasks in graph mining, which
motivates the recent studies of leveraging contrastive learning to enhance the
performance. However, we observe two major weaknesses of these studies: i) the
lack of theoretical analysis for contrastive learning on link prediction, and
ii) inadequate consideration of node degrees in contrastive learning. To
address the above weaknesses, we provide the first formal theoretical analysis
for contrastive learning on link prediction, where our analysis results can
generalize to the autoencoder-based link prediction models with contrastive
learning. Motivated by our analysis results, we propose a new graph
augmentation approach, Edge Balancing Augmentation (EBA), which adjusts the
node degrees in the graph as the augmentation. We then propose a new approach,
named Contrastive Link Prediction with Edge Balancing Augmentation (CoEBA),
that integrates the proposed EBA and the proposed new contrastive losses to
improve the model performance. We conduct experiments on 8 benchmark datasets.
The results demonstrate that our proposed CoEBA significantly outperforms the
other state-of-the-art link prediction models.

TL;DR: 论文研究了使用潜在Kronecker高斯过程预测学习曲线来指导Successive Halving算法，以避免过早剪枝慢启动的超参数配置。实验表明预测方法表现良好但需要完全观测的学习曲线数据作为训练，不如直接给标准方法更多资源有效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Successive Halving算法依赖中间性能值做资源分配决策，可能导致过早剪枝那些启动较慢但最终会成为最佳候选的超参数配置。

Method: 使用基于潜在Kronecker高斯过程的学习曲线预测来指导Successive Halving算法，而不是仅依赖当前性能值。

Result: 在大规模实证研究中，预测方法达到了有竞争力的性能，但与给标准方法投入更多资源相比并非帕累托最优，因为它需要完全观测的学习曲线作为训练数据。

Conclusion: 虽然预测方法表现良好，但其需要完全观测学习曲线数据的缺点可以通过利用现有学习曲线数据来缓解。

Abstract: Successive Halving is a popular algorithm for hyperparameter optimization
which allocates exponentially more resources to promising candidates. However,
the algorithm typically relies on intermediate performance values to make
resource allocation decisions, which can cause it to prematurely prune slow
starters that would eventually become the best candidate. We investigate
whether guiding Successive Halving with learning curve predictions based on
Latent Kronecker Gaussian Processes can overcome this limitation. In a
large-scale empirical study involving different neural network architectures
and a click prediction dataset, we compare this predictive approach to the
standard approach based on current performance values. Our experiments show
that, although the predictive approach achieves competitive performance, it is
not Pareto optimal compared to investing more resources into the standard
approach, because it requires fully observed learning curves as training data.
However, this downside could be mitigated by leveraging existing learning curve
data.

Conclusion: AME提供了一个原则性和可推广的数据无关模型权重聚合概念，为神经平均操作提供了明确的定义和实施方法。

Abstract: What does it even mean to average neural networks? We investigate the problem
of synthesizing a single neural network from a collection of pretrained models,
each trained on disjoint data shards, using only their final weights and no
access to training data. In forming a definition of neural averaging, we take
insight from model soup, which appears to aggregate multiple models into a
singular model while enhancing generalization performance. In this work, we
reinterpret model souping as a special case of a broader framework: Amortized
Model Ensembling (AME) for neural averaging, a data-free meta-optimization
approach that treats model differences as pseudogradients to guide neural
weight updates. We show that this perspective not only recovers model soup but
enables more expressive and adaptive ensembling strategies. Empirically, AME
produces averaged neural solutions that outperform both individual experts and
model soup baselines, especially in out-of-distribution settings. Our results
suggest a principled and generalizable notion of data-free model weight
aggregation and defines, in one sense, how to perform neural averaging.

Abstract: Temporal graph learning is crucial for dynamic networks where nodes and edges
evolve over time and new nodes continuously join the system. Inductive
representation learning in such settings faces two major challenges:
effectively representing unseen nodes and mitigating noisy or redundant graph
information. We propose GTGIB, a versatile framework that integrates Graph
Structure Learning (GSL) with Temporal Graph Information Bottleneck (TGIB). We
design a novel two-step GSL-based structural enhancer to enrich and optimize
node neighborhoods and demonstrate its effectiveness and efficiency through
theoretical proofs and experiments. The TGIB refines the optimized graph by
extending the information bottleneck principle to temporal graphs, regularizing
both edges and features based on our derived tractable TGIB objective function
via variational approximation, enabling stable and efficient optimization.
GTGIB-based models are evaluated to predict links on four real-world datasets;
they outperform existing methods in all datasets under the inductive setting,
with significant and consistent improvement in the transductive setting.

classification by integrating four complementary biochemical modalities:
protein sequence embeddings, quantum-derived electronic descriptors, molecular
graph structures, and 2D molecular image representations. Quantum Vision
Transformer (QVT) backbone equipped with modality-specific encoders and a
unified cross-attention fusion module. By integrating graph features and
spatial patterns, our method captures key stereoelectronic interactions behind
enzyme function. Experimental results demonstrate that our multimodal QVT model
achieves a top-1 accuracy of 85.1%, outperforming sequence-only baselines by a
substantial margin and achieving better performance results compared to other
QML models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于指数梯度下降和Bregman投影的本征优化方法，直接优化对抗后缀token的松弛one-hot编码，有效实现LLM越狱攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管RLHF等对齐技术在典型提示上取得成功，但LLM仍然容易受到通过精心设计的对抗触发器实现的越狱攻击。现有方法要么依赖离散token空间的低效搜索，要么直接优化连续嵌入，但后者无法用于专有模型且投影回离散token会降低攻击效果。

Method: 使用指数梯度下降结合Bregman投影，直接优化对抗后缀token的松弛one-hot编码，确保每个token的优化one-hot编码始终保持在概率单纯形内。

Result: 在5个开源LLM和4个对抗行为数据集上评估，相比3个最先进基线方法，获得了更高的成功率和更快的收敛速度。还能生成跨多个提示有效的通用对抗后缀，并展示优化后缀到不同LLM的可迁移性。

Conclusion: 提出的本征优化方法为LLM越狱攻击提供了一种有效的解决方案，在攻击效果和效率方面均优于现有方法，同时具备通用性和可迁移性。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in critical
applications, ensuring their robustness and safety alignment remains a major
challenge. Despite the overall success of alignment techniques such as
reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) on typical prompts, LLMs
remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks enabled by crafted adversarial triggers
appended to user prompts. Most existing jailbreak methods either rely on
inefficient searches over discrete token spaces or direct optimization of
continuous embeddings. While continuous embeddings can be given directly to
selected open-source models as input, doing so is not feasible for proprietary
models. On the other hand, projecting these embeddings back into valid discrete
tokens introduces additional complexity and often reduces attack effectiveness.
We propose an intrinsic optimization method which directly optimizes relaxed
one-hot encodings of the adversarial suffix tokens using exponentiated gradient
descent coupled with Bregman projection, ensuring that the optimized one-hot
encoding of each token always remains within the probability simplex. We
provide theoretical proof of convergence for our proposed method and implement
an efficient algorithm that effectively jailbreaks several widely used LLMs.
Our method achieves higher success rates and faster convergence compared to
three state-of-the-art baselines, evaluated on five open-source LLMs and four
adversarial behavior datasets curated for evaluating jailbreak methods. In
addition to individual prompt attacks, we also generate universal adversarial
suffixes effective across multiple prompts and demonstrate transferability of
optimized suffixes to different LLMs.

TL;DR: 这篇论文研究了深度强化学习中的计算优化扩展问题，发现了TD过拟合现象，并提出了根据计算预算选择批处理大小和UTD比例的指南


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着模型变大和训练成本增加，需要在固定计算预算下寻求最大化性能效果，而强化学习在这方面的研究较少

Method: 研究了模型容量和更新到数据比例(UTD)两个主要轴心，分析了不同批处大小和模型规模对Q函数准确性的影响

Result: 发现了TD过拟合现象：小模型中增加批处大小会快速容式Q函数准确性，但大模型中这种效应消失，从而能够有效使用大批处进行扩展

Conclusion: 提供了选择批处大小和UTD比例以优化计算使用的指南，为深度强化学习的计算优化扩展提供了基础

Abstract: As models grow larger and training them becomes expensive, it becomes
increasingly important to scale training recipes not just to larger models and
more data, but to do so in a compute-optimal manner that extracts maximal
performance per unit of compute. While such scaling has been well studied for
language modeling, reinforcement learning (RL) has received less attention in
this regard. In this paper, we investigate compute scaling for online,
value-based deep RL. These methods present two primary axes for compute
allocation: model capacity and the update-to-data (UTD) ratio. Given a fixed
compute budget, we ask: how should resources be partitioned across these axes
to maximize sample efficiency? Our analysis reveals a nuanced interplay between
model size, batch size, and UTD. In particular, we identify a phenomenon we
call TD-overfitting: increasing the batch quickly harms Q-function accuracy for
small models, but this effect is absent in large models, enabling effective use
of large batch size at scale. We provide a mental model for understanding this
phenomenon and build guidelines for choosing batch size and UTD to optimize
compute usage. Our findings provide a grounded starting point for
compute-optimal scaling in deep RL, mirroring studies in supervised learning
but adapted to TD learning.

### [231] [Quantization Meets Spikes: Lossless Conversion in the First Timestep via Polarity Multi-Spike Mapping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14520)
*Hangming Zhang,Zheng Li,Qiang Yu*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新的极性多刻座标映方法(PMSM)，实现了在单时间步下几乎无损失的ANN到SNN转换，在多个数据集上创造了新的性能纪录，同时降低了能耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然ANN到SNN转换方法保持了实用性，但现有方法难以在超低延迟(单时间步)下实现无净度损失，同时量化层容易丢失负值信息且对超参数敏感。

Method: 通过信息瑣分析量化层导致的信息丢失，提出极性多刻座标映(PMSM)方法和专门的量化层超参数调整策略。

Result: 在ViT-S架构上仅用一个时间步就达到了CIFAR-10 98.5%、CIFAR-100 89.3%、ImageNet 81.6%的独创性能纪录，在VGG-16上比基线方法节省超过5倍能耗。

Conclusion: 该方法成功实现了超低延迟下的高精度ANN到SNN转换，为高效能刻座神经网络的实际应用提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) offer advantages in computational efficiency
via event-driven computing, compared to traditional artificial neural networks
(ANNs). While direct training methods tackle the challenge of
non-differentiable activation mechanisms in SNNs, they often suffer from high
computational and energy costs during training. As a result, ANN-to-SNN
conversion approach still remains a valuable and practical alternative. These
conversion-based methods aim to leverage the discrete output produced by the
quantization layer to obtain SNNs with low latency. Although the theoretical
minimum latency is one timestep, existing conversion methods have struggled to
realize such ultra-low latency without accuracy loss. Moreover, current
quantization approaches often discard negative-value information following
batch normalization and are highly sensitive to the hyperparameter
configuration, leading to degraded performance. In this work, we, for the first
time, analyze the information loss introduced by quantization layers through
the lens of information entropy. Building on our analysis, we introduce
Polarity Multi-Spike Mapping (PMSM) and a hyperparameter adjustment strategy
tailored for the quantization layer. Our method achieves nearly lossless
ANN-to-SNN conversion at the extremity, i.e., the first timestep, while also
leveraging the temporal dynamics of SNNs across multiple timesteps to maintain
stable performance on complex tasks. Experimental results show that our PMSM
achieves state-of-the-art accuracies of 98.5% on CIFAR-10, 89.3% on CIFAR-100
and 81.6% on ImageNet with only one timestep on ViT-S architecture,
establishing a new benchmark for efficient conversion. In addition, our method
reduces energy consumption by over 5x under VGG-16 on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100,
compared to the baseline method.

TL;DR: FinAgentBench是首个金融领域多步推理检索的大规模基准测试，包含3,429个专家标注样本，评估LLM代理在金融文档检索中的两步推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统检索方法在金融领域准确性不足，需要同时捕获语义相似性和进行细粒度推理。虽然LLMs为多步推理检索提供了新机会，但金融领域缺乏相应的评估基准。

Method: 构建包含S&P-100上市公司3,429个专家标注样本的基准测试，将检索过程分为两个推理步骤：(1)识别最相关文档类型，(2)在选定文档中定位关键段落，以解决上下文限制问题。

Result: 评估了多个最先进模型，并证明针对性微调可以显著提升代理检索性能。基准为理解金融领域检索导向的LLM行为提供了量化基础。

Conclusion: FinAgentBench为研究复杂领域特定任务中检索导向的LLM行为奠定了基础，计划扩展至S&P 500及更广泛范围，并将公开数据集。

Abstract: Accurate information retrieval (IR) is critical in the financial domain,
where investors must identify relevant information from large collections of
documents. Traditional IR methods-whether sparse or dense-often fall short in
retrieval accuracy, as it requires not only capturing semantic similarity but
also performing fine-grained reasoning over document structure and
domain-specific knowledge. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have
opened up new opportunities for retrieval with multi-step reasoning, where the
model ranks passages through iterative reasoning about which information is
most relevant to a given query. However, there exists no benchmark to evaluate
such capabilities in the financial domain. To address this gap, we introduce
FinAgentBench, the first large-scale benchmark for evaluating retrieval with
multi-step reasoning in finance -- a setting we term agentic retrieval. The
benchmark consists of 3,429 expert-annotated examples on S&P-100 listed firms
and assesses whether LLM agents can (1) identify the most relevant document
type among candidates, and (2) pinpoint the key passage within the selected
document. Our evaluation framework explicitly separates these two reasoning
steps to address context limitations. This design enables to provide a
quantitative basis for understanding retrieval-centric LLM behavior in finance.
We evaluate a suite of state-of-the-art models and further demonstrated how
targeted fine-tuning can significantly improve agentic retrieval performance.
Our benchmark provides a foundation for studying retrieval-centric LLM behavior
in complex, domain-specific tasks for finance. We will release the dataset
publicly upon acceptance of the paper and plan to expand and share dataset for
the full S&P 500 and beyond.

Motivation: 游戏行业快速发展需要可扩展的推荐系统，现有模型未能充分利用游戏时长这一独特行为信号，且忽视了多模态信息在提升多样性方面的潜力

Method: 提出双阶段模型：1）游戏时长引导的兴趣强度探索模块，通过双beta建模区分强弱偏好；2）游戏时长引导的多模态随机游走模块，基于游戏时长相似性和多模态语义相似性模拟玩家探索

Result: 在真实游戏数据集上的实验表明，DP2Rec在推荐准确性和多样性方面均优于现有方法

Conclusion: DP2Rec通过有效利用游戏时长和多模态信息，成功实现了准确性和多样性的联合优化，为游戏推荐系统提供了新的解决方案

Abstract: The explosive growth of the video game industry has created an urgent need
for recommendation systems that can scale with expanding catalogs and maintain
user engagement. While prior work has explored accuracy and diversity in
recommendations, existing models underutilize playtime, a rich behavioral
signal unique to gaming platforms, and overlook the potential of multimodal
information to enhance diversity. In this paper, we propose DP2Rec, a novel
Dual-Phase Playtime-guided Recommendation model designed to jointly optimize
accuracy and diversity. First, we introduce a playtime-guided interest
intensity exploration module that separates strong and weak preferences via
dual-beta modeling, enabling fine-grained user profiling and more accurate
recommendations. Second, we present a playtime-guided multimodal random walks
module that simulates player exploration using transitions guided by both
playtime-derived interest similarity and multimodal semantic similarity. This
mechanism preserves core preferences while promoting cross-category discovery
through latent semantic associations and adaptive category balancing. Extensive
experiments on a real-world game dataset show that DP2Rec outperforms existing
methods in both recommendation accuracy and diversity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代领域特定数据（医疗记录、防御日志、网页流量等）虽然结构化但缺乏语法重复，传统gzip基于二进制模式重复的压缩方法效果有限

Method: 使用GPT-2作为预处理器，将领域特定文件转换为适合gzip压缩的格式，构建预处理+gzip的两阶段压缩管道

Result: 实验显示防御日志压缩率提升0.34%，HTML文件压缩率提升5.8%，在真实和合成数据上均取得积极效果

Conclusion: GPT-based预处理方法能有效解决领域特定文件的压缩难题，为结构化但缺乏语法重复的数据提供了有效的压缩解决方案

Abstract: In the modern era, large volumes of data are being produced continuously,
especially in domain-specific fields such as medical records and clinical
files, defence logs and HTML-based web traffic. Data with such volume and
complexity needs to be compressed before storing and transmitting efficiently.
Data compression has gained significant attention from modern researchers,
resulting in the development of fast and efficient compression algorithms such
as Gzip. However, since gzip works on the principle of repetition of binary
patterns, one of the limitations of gzip is that domain-specific formats like
JSON, XML, HTML, and log files, while structured, may have semantic repetition
but not syntactic repetition, which gzip finds difficult to compress. In this
article, we propose a GPT-based preprocessor for such domain-specific files. We
propose a pipeline made up of GPT-2 taking domain-specific files as input,
which pattern-based compressors like gzip find difficult to work on. The
preprocessor results are output in a file that is designed for compressors like
gzip. After preprocessing, the gzip works on the other end of the pipeline and
compresses the data as usual. We used different types of both real-world and
synthetically generated data, such as logs and HTML files, for the experiment
of the proposed model. We found promising results and an improvement of the
Defence logs by 0.34 per cent and HTML files by 5.8 per cent.

Motivation: 大型语言模型在医学领域显示出潜力，但需要系统评估其在专业神经学推理方面的能力，特别是在处理复杂临床推理挑战时的表现。

Method: 使用305个以色列神经学认证考试问题构建基准测试，按三个复杂度维度分类。评估了10个LLM的基础模型、检索增强生成(RAG)和新颖的多智能体系统，该系统将神经学推理分解为专门认知功能。

Result: OpenAI-o1基础模型表现最佳(90.9%准确率)，专业医学模型表现较差(Meditron-70B为52.9%)。RAG效果有限，而多智能体系统带来显著提升，LLaMA 3.3-70B从69.5%提升至89.2%，在复杂问题上表现尤其突出。

Conclusion: 结构化多智能体方法能显著增强复杂医学推理能力，通过模拟专门认知过程解决了RAG无法处理的神经学推理挑战，为AI在临床环境中的应用提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in medical domains, but their
ability to handle specialized neurological reasoning requires systematic
evaluation. We developed a comprehensive benchmark using 305 questions from
Israeli Board Certification Exams in Neurology, classified along three
complexity dimensions: factual knowledge depth, clinical concept integration,
and reasoning complexity. We evaluated ten LLMs using base models,
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and a novel multi-agent system. Results
showed significant performance variation. OpenAI-o1 achieved the highest base
performance (90.9% accuracy), while specialized medical models performed poorly
(52.9% for Meditron-70B). RAG provided modest benefits but limited
effectiveness on complex reasoning questions. In contrast, our multi-agent
framework, decomposing neurological reasoning into specialized cognitive
functions including question analysis, knowledge retrieval, answer synthesis,
and validation, achieved dramatic improvements, especially for mid-range
models. The LLaMA 3.3-70B-based agentic system reached 89.2% accuracy versus
69.5% for its base model, with substantial gains on level 3 complexity
questions. The multi-agent approach transformed inconsistent subspecialty
performance into uniform excellence, addressing neurological reasoning
challenges that persisted with RAG enhancement. We validated our approach using
an independent dataset of 155 neurological cases from MedQA. Results confirm
that structured multi-agent approaches designed to emulate specialized
cognitive processes significantly enhance complex medical reasoning, offering
promising directions for AI assistance in challenging clinical contexts.

based on what actually occurs in a real-life sports match. For any given sports
match, there are a multitude of contests available to players, with substantial
variation across 3 main dimensions: entry fee, number of spots, and the prize
pool distribution. As player preferences are also quite heterogeneous, contest
personalization is an important tool to match players with contests. This paper
presents a scalable contest recommendation system, powered by a Wide and Deep
Interaction Ranker (WiDIR) at its core. We productionized this system at our

Motivation: RAG技术虽在AI领域快速发展且工业界开始采用，但缺乏对其实际工业应用的研究，需要了解企业在实践中如何应用RAG技术。

Method: 采用半结构化访谈研究方法，对13位行业从业者进行访谈，探索RAG在真实环境中的应用现状。

Result: 研究发现：RAG应用主要限于领域特定问答任务；系统需求集中在数据保护、安全和质量；数据预处理是主要挑战；系统评估主要依赖人工方法；伦理、偏见和可扩展性问题关注较少。

Conclusion: RAG在工业界的应用仍处于早期阶段，需要更多关注数据预处理挑战、自动化评估方法以及伦理偏见等社会技术问题，为未来RAG系统的工业部署提供指导。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a well-established and rapidly
evolving field within AI that enhances the outputs of large language models by
integrating relevant information retrieved from external knowledge sources.
While industry adoption of RAG is now beginning, there is a significant lack of
research on its practical application in industrial contexts. To address this
gap, we conducted a semistructured interview study with 13 industry
practitioners to explore the current state of RAG adoption in real-world
settings. Our study investigates how companies apply RAG in practice, providing
(1) an overview of industry use cases, (2) a consolidated list of system
requirements, (3) key challenges and lessons learned from practical
experiences, and (4) an analysis of current industry evaluation methods. Our
main findings show that current RAG applications are mostly limited to
domain-specific QA tasks, with systems still in prototype stages; industry
requirements focus primarily on data protection, security, and quality, while
issues such as ethics, bias, and scalability receive less attention; data
preprocessing remains a key challenge, and system evaluation is predominantly

TL;DR: RewardRank是一个通过反事实奖励学习建模用户行为的排名框架，使用深度效用模型预测用户参与度，并通过可微分软排列算子优化排名策略，在大型基准测试中表现优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统排名系统依赖简化的代理损失函数，无法捕捉真实用户行为中的复杂偏差（如位置偏差、品牌亲和力等），导致模型与用户实际效用不匹配。

Method: 首先训练深度效用模型来估计整个项目排列的用户参与度，然后使用可微分软排列算子优化排名策略以最大化预测效用，支持端到端训练。提出KD-Eval和LLM-Eval两种自动评估协议。

Result: 在Baidu-ULTR和Amazon KDD Cup等大规模基准测试中，该方法 consistently outperforms强基线方法。

Conclusion: 建模用户行为动态对于效用优化排名非常有效，RewardRank框架能够更好地捕捉真实用户偏好并提升排名性能。

Abstract: Traditional ranking systems rely on proxy loss functions that assume
simplistic user behavior, such as users preferring a rank list where items are
sorted by hand-crafted relevance. However, real-world user interactions are
influenced by complex behavioral biases, including position bias, brand
affinity, decoy effects, and similarity aversion, which these objectives fail
to capture. As a result, models trained on such losses often misalign with
actual user utility, such as the probability of any click or purchase across
the ranked list. In this work, we propose a data-driven framework for modeling
user behavior through counterfactual reward learning. Our method, RewardRank,
first trains a deep utility model to estimate user engagement for entire item
permutations using logged data. Then, a ranking policy is optimized to maximize
predicted utility via differentiable soft permutation operators, enabling
end-to-end training over the space of factual and counterfactual rankings. To
address the challenge of evaluation without ground-truth for unseen
permutations, we introduce two automated protocols: (i) $\textit{KD-Eval}$,
using a position-aware oracle for counterfactual reward estimation, and (ii)
$\textit{LLM-Eval}$, which simulates user preferences via large language
models. Experiments on large-scale benchmarks, including Baidu-ULTR and the
Amazon KDD Cup datasets, demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms
strong baselines, highlighting the effectiveness of modeling user behavior
dynamics for utility-optimized ranking. Our code is available at:

Motivation: 传统推荐系统重排序方法采用两阶段搜索范式(GSU+ESU)，存在严重的不一致性问题——GSU经常错过ESU中的高价值列表，需要在效果和效率之间做出权衡。

Method: 提出YOLOR单阶段重排序方法：1) 基于树的上下文提取模块(TCEM)分层聚合多尺度上下文特征实现列表级有效性；2) 上下文缓存模块(CCM)实现候选排列间的特征高效重用，达到排列级效率。

Result: 在公共和工业数据集上的广泛实验验证了YOLOR的性能，并已成功在美团外卖平台部署。

Conclusion: YOLOR通过创新的单阶段架构设计，有效解决了传统两阶段重排序方法的不一致性问题，在保持高效的同时提升了推荐效果。

Abstract: Reranking plays a crucial role in modern recommender systems by capturing the
mutual influences within the list. Due to the inherent challenges of
combinatorial search spaces, most methods adopt a two-stage search paradigm: a
simple General Search Unit (GSU) efficiently reduces the candidate space, and
an Exact Search Unit (ESU) effectively selects the optimal sequence. These
methods essentially involve making trade-offs between effectiveness and
efficiency, while suffering from a severe \textbf{inconsistency problem}, that
is, the GSU often misses high-value lists from ESU. To address this problem, we
propose YOLOR, a one-stage reranking method that removes the GSU while
retaining only the ESU. Specifically, YOLOR includes: (1) a Tree-based Context
Extraction Module (TCEM) that hierarchically aggregates multi-scale contextual
features to achieve "list-level effectiveness", and (2) a Context Cache Module
(CCM) that enables efficient feature reuse across candidate permutations to
achieve "permutation-level efficiency". Extensive experiments across public and
industry datasets validate YOLOR's performance, and we have successfully
deployed YOLOR on the Meituan food delivery platform.

### [242] [Diverse Negative Sampling for Implicit Collaborative Filtering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14468)
*Yueqing Xuan,Kacper Sokol,Mark Sanderson,Jeffrey Chan*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: DivNS是一种新颖的负采样方法，通过引入多样性来提升隐式协同过滤推荐器的性能，解决了传统方法负样本同质化的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统负采样策略倾向于从密集区域过采样负样本，导致负训练数据同质化，限制了模型的表达能力和泛化性能。

Method: DivNS包含三个核心组件：1）发现困难负样本并构建用户特定缓存；2）多样性增强采样器从缓存中选择多样化负样本；3）合成负样本生成器结合多样性和困难负样本形成更有效的训练数据。

Result: 在四个公共数据集上的广泛实验表明，DivNS能显著提升推荐质量，同时保持计算效率。

Conclusion: DivNS通过生成既信息丰富又多样化的负样本，使推荐器能够学习更广泛的物品空间，提高了模型的泛化能力。

Abstract: Implicit collaborative filtering recommenders are usually trained to learn
user positive preferences. Negative sampling, which selects informative
negative items to form negative training data, plays a crucial role in this
process. Since items are often clustered in the latent space, existing negative
sampling strategies normally oversample negative items from the dense regions.
This leads to homogeneous negative data and limited model expressiveness. In
this paper, we propose Diverse Negative Sampling (DivNS), a novel approach that
explicitly accounts for diversity in negative training data during the negative
sampling process. DivNS first finds hard negative items with large preference
scores and constructs user-specific caches that store unused but highly
informative negative samples. Then, its diversity-augmented sampler selects a
diverse subset of negative items from the cache while ensuring dissimilarity
from the user's hard negatives. Finally, a synthetic negatives generator
combines the selected diverse negatives with hard negatives to form more
effective training data. The resulting synthetic negatives are both informative
and diverse, enabling recommenders to learn a broader item space and improve
their generalisability. Extensive experiments on four public datasets
demonstrate the effectiveness of DivNS in improving recommendation quality
while maintaining computational efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于ID的推荐方法存在数据稀疏性问题，现有多模态推荐方法主要采用早期融合方式，忽视了用户行为序列的上下文影响，无法根据行为模式动态调整多模态兴趣表示。

Method: 提出Distribution-Guided Multimodal-Interest Auto-Encoder (DMAE)模型，在行为级别实现用户多模态兴趣的跨模态融合。

Result: 大量实验证明了DMAE的优越性能。

Conclusion: DMAE通过行为级别的跨模态融合，有效提升了多模态推荐的效果，能够更好地捕捉用户的多模态兴趣。

Abstract: Traditional recommendation methods rely on correlating the embedding vectors
of item IDs to capture implicit collaborative filtering signals to model the
user's interest in the target item. Consequently, traditional ID-based methods
often encounter data sparsity problems stemming from the sparse nature of ID
features. To alleviate the problem of item ID sparsity, recommendation models
incorporate multimodal item information to enhance recommendation accuracy.
However, existing multimodal recommendation methods typically employ early
fusion approaches, which focus primarily on combining text and image features,
while neglecting the contextual influence of user behavior sequences. This
oversight prevents dynamic adaptation of multimodal interest representations
based on behavioral patterns, consequently restricting the model's capacity to
effectively capture user multimodal interests. Therefore, this paper proposes
the Distribution-Guided Multimodal-Interest Auto-Encoder (DMAE), which achieves
the cross fusion of user multimodal interest at the behavioral
level.Ultimately, extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of DMAE.

*Moyu Zhang,Yujun Jin,Jinxin Hu,Yu Zhang*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: GSVR框架通过变分推断和全局知识先验，解决了多场景推荐中场景特定表示学习的数据稀疏性问题，提升了现有方法的表示鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多场景推荐方法使用共享底层表示，无法充分捕捉场景独特性。不同场景中用户和物品应具有特定特征，但跨场景交互差异导致数据稀疏，阻碍了场景特定表示的学习。

Method: 提出全局分布感知的场景特定变分表示学习框架(GSVR)：1)使用概率模型生成用户和物品在每个场景中的特定分布；2)通过变分推断估计分布；3)引入全局知识感知的多项分布作为先验知识，调节后验分布学习。

Result: 大量实验结果表明，GSVR能有效帮助现有多场景推荐方法学习更鲁棒的表示，缓解稀疏场景中记录较少的用户或物品被淹没的风险。

Conclusion: GSVR框架通过变分推断和全局先验知识的结合，成功解决了多场景推荐中的表示学习挑战，为现有方法提供了有效的增强方案。

Abstract: With the emergence of e-commerce, the recommendations provided by commercial
platforms must adapt to diverse scenarios to accommodate users' varying
shopping preferences. Current methods typically use a unified framework to
offer personalized recommendations for different scenarios. However, they often
employ shared bottom representations, which partially hinders the model's
capacity to capture scenario uniqueness. Ideally, users and items should
exhibit specific characteristics in different scenarios, prompting the need to
learn scenario-specific representations to differentiate scenarios. Yet,
variations in user and item interactions across scenarios lead to data sparsity
issues, impeding the acquisition of scenario-specific representations. To learn
robust scenario-specific representations, we introduce a Global-Distribution
Aware Scenario-Specific Variational Representation Learning Framework (GSVR)
that can be directly applied to existing multi-scenario methods. Specifically,
considering the uncertainty stemming from limited samples, our approach employs
a probabilistic model to generate scenario-specific distributions for each user
and item in each scenario, estimated through variational inference (VI).
Additionally, we introduce the global knowledge-aware multinomial distributions
as prior knowledge to regulate the learning of the posterior user and item
distributions, ensuring similarities among distributions for users with akin
interests and items with similar side information. This mitigates the risk of
users or items with fewer records being overwhelmed in sparse scenarios.
Extensive experimental results affirm the efficacy of GSVR in assisting
existing multi-scenario recommendation methods in learning more robust
representations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有生成式推荐系统主要关注序列生成，不适合CTR预测任务。CTR模型严重依赖目标物品与用户之间的交叉特征，丢弃这些特征会显著影响性能。需要利用生成模型理解数据分布的能力来缓解传统判别模型在标签稀缺空间的约束

Method: 提出两阶段离散扩散生成CTR训练框架(DGenCTR)：1) 扩散生成预训练阶段 - 使用离散扩散模型学习数据分布；2) CTR定向监督微调阶段 - 针对CTR任务进行微调

Result: 通过大量离线实验和在线A/B测试，验证了该框架的有效性

Conclusion: DGenCTR框架成功将生成模型应用于CTR预测任务，解决了传统方法在标签稀缺场景下的局限性，为推荐系统提供了新的生成式解决方案

Abstract: Recent advances in generative models have inspired the field of recommender
systems to explore generative approaches, but most existing research focuses on
sequence generation, a paradigm ill-suited for click-through rate (CTR)
prediction. CTR models critically depend on a large number of cross-features
between the target item and the user to estimate the probability of clicking on
the item, and discarding these cross-features will significantly impair model
performance. Therefore, to harness the ability of generative models to
understand data distributions and thereby alleviate the constraints of
traditional discriminative models in label-scarce space, diverging from the
item-generation paradigm of sequence generation methods, we propose a novel
sample-level generation paradigm specifically designed for the CTR task: a
two-stage Discrete Diffusion-Based Generative CTR training framework (DGenCTR).
This two-stage framework comprises a diffusion-based generative pre-training
stage and a CTR-targeted supervised fine-tuning stage for CTR. Finally,
extensive offline experiments and online A/B testing conclusively validate the
effectiveness of our framework.

Conclusion: MISS是首个在树基检索模型中整合多模态信息和终身序列建模的探索性工作，为大规模推荐系统的检索阶段提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Large-scale industrial recommendation systems typically employ a two-stage
paradigm of retrieval and ranking to handle huge amounts of information. Recent
research focuses on improving the performance of retrieval model. A promising
way is to introduce extensive information about users and items. On one hand,
lifelong sequential behavior is valuable. Existing lifelong behavior modeling
methods in ranking stage focus on the interaction of lifelong behavior and
candidate items from retrieval stage. In retrieval stage, it is difficult to
utilize lifelong behavior because of a large corpus of candidate items. On the
other hand, existing retrieval methods mostly relay on interaction information,
potentially disregarding valuable multi-modal information. To solve these
problems, we represent the pioneering exploration of leveraging multi-modal
information and lifelong sequence model within the advanced tree-based
retrieval model. We propose Multi-modal Indexing and Searching with lifelong
Sequence (MISS), which contains a multi-modal index tree and a multi-modal
lifelong sequence modeling module. Specifically, for better index structure, we
propose multi-modal index tree, which is built using the multi-modal embedding
to precisely represent item similarity. To precisely capture diverse user
interests in user lifelong sequence, we propose collaborative general search
unit (Co-GSU) and multi-modal general search unit (MM-GSU) for
multi-perspective interests searching.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 本地生活服务推荐需要同时考虑用户兴趣和实时地理位置，现有端到端生成推荐模型无法有效处理地理信息平衡多目标，因此需要开发专门的地理感知推荐系统。

Method: 提出OneLoc模型：1）地理感知语义ID融合视频和地理信息；2）地理感知自注意力机制利用视频位置相似性和用户实时位置；3）邻居感知提示捕获用户周围上下文信息；使用强化学习设计地理奖励和GMV奖励函数平衡多目标。

Conclusion: OneLoc成功解决了本地生活服务推荐中的地理信息利用和多目标平衡问题，证明了端到端生成式推荐模型在该场景的有效性和实用性。

Abstract: Local life service is a vital scenario in Kuaishou App, where video
recommendation is intrinsically linked with store's location information. Thus,
recommendation in our scenario is challenging because we should take into
account user's interest and real-time location at the same time. In the face of
such complex scenarios, end-to-end generative recommendation has emerged as a
new paradigm, such as OneRec in the short video scenario, OneSug in the search
scenario, and EGA in the advertising scenario. However, in local life service,
an end-to-end generative recommendation model has not yet been developed as
there are some key challenges to be solved. The first challenge is how to make
full use of geographic information. The second challenge is how to balance
multiple objectives, including user interests, the distance between user and
stores, and some other business objectives. To address the challenges, we
propose OneLoc. Specifically, we leverage geographic information from different
perspectives: (1) geo-aware semantic ID incorporates both video and geographic
information for tokenization, (2) geo-aware self-attention in the encoder
leverages both video location similarity and user's real-time location, and (3)
neighbor-aware prompt captures rich context information surrounding users for
generation. To balance multiple objectives, we use reinforcement learning and
propose two reward functions, i.e., geographic reward and GMV reward. With the
above design, OneLoc achieves outstanding offline and online performance. In
fact, OneLoc has been deployed in local life service of Kuaishou App. It serves
400 million active users daily, achieving 21.016% and 17.891% improvements in
terms of gross merchandise value (GMV) and orders numbers.

Result: 方法在提高真正率指标方面超过现有最佳方法，同时减少了对负面项目的错误推荐

Conclusion: 综合利用正负反馈能够显著提升序列推荐系统的性能和用户体验

Abstract: We consider the task of learning from both positive and negative feedback in
a sequential recommendation scenario, as both types of feedback are often
present in user interactions. Meanwhile, conventional sequential learning
models usually focus on considering and predicting positive interactions,
ignoring that reducing items with negative feedback in recommendations improves
user satisfaction with the service. Moreover, the negative feedback can
potentially provide a useful signal for more accurate identification of true
user interests. In this work, we propose to train two transformer encoders on
separate positive and negative interaction sequences. We incorporate both types
of feedback into the training objective of the sequential recommender using a
composite loss function that includes positive and negative cross-entropy as
well as a cleverly crafted contrastive term, that helps better modeling
opposing patterns. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach in terms
of increasing true-positive metrics compared to state-of-the-art sequential
recommendation methods while reducing the number of wrongly promoted negative
items.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统室友匹配问题主要关注室友偏好，但现实中人们既关心室友也关心房间质量。Chan等人最近提出了同时考虑房间和室友偏好的模型，需要研究在这种扩展模型下的稳定分配机制及其性质

Method: 采用串行独裁算法实现4人稳定分配，分析TTC算法的变体，识别特定偏好结构下多项式时间可解的2人稳定分配

Result: 串行独裁算法能产生帕累托最优且策略证明的4人稳定分配，但无法保证2人稳定性；TTC变体无法同时满足策略证明和帕累托最优；在特定偏好结构下可在多项式时间内找到2人稳定分配

Conclusion: 在同时考虑房间和室友偏好的室友匹配问题中，4人稳定分配相对容易实现且具有良好的性质，而2人稳定分配的计算复杂性较高，但在特定结构下可高效求解

Abstract: In the roommate matching model, given a set of 2n agents and n rooms, we find
an assignment of a pair of agents to a room. Although the roommate matching
problem is well studied, the study of the model when agents have preference
over both rooms and roommates was recently initiated by Chan et al. [11]. We
study two types of stable roommate assignments, namely, 4-person stable (4PS)
and 2-person stable (2PS) in conjunction with efficiency and
strategy-proofness. We design a simple serial dictatorship based algorithm for
finding a 4PS assignment that is Pareto optimal and strategy-proof. However,
the serial dictatorship algorithm is far from being 2PS. Next, we study top
trading cycle (TTC) based algorithms. We show that variations of TTC cannot be
strategy-proof or PO. Finally, as Chan et al. (2016) showed that deciding the
existence of 2PS assignment is NP-complete, we identify preference structures
where a 2PS assignment can be found in polynomial time.

Abstract: The optimal signaling schemes in information design (Bayesian persuasion)
problems often involve non-explainable randomization or disconnected partitions
of state space, which are too intricate to be audited or communicated. We
propose explainable information design in the context of information design
with a continuous state space, restricting the information designer to use
$K$-partitional signaling schemes defined by deterministic and monotone
partitions of the state space, where a unique signal is sent for all states in
each part. We first prove that the price of explainability (PoE) -- the ratio
between the performances of the optimal explainable signaling scheme and
unrestricted signaling scheme -- is exactly $1/2$ in the worst case, meaning
that partitional signaling schemes are never worse than arbitrary signaling
schemes by a factor of 2.
  We then study the complexity of computing optimal explainable signaling
schemes. We show that the exact optimization problem is NP-hard in general. But
for Lipschitz utility functions, an $\varepsilon$-approximately optimal
explainable signaling scheme can be computed in polynomial time. And for
piecewise constant utility functions, we provide an efficient algorithm to find
an explainable signaling scheme that provides a $1/2$ approximation to the
optimal unrestricted signaling scheme, which matches the worst-case PoE bound.
  A technical tool we develop is a conversion from any optimal signaling scheme
(which satisfies a bi-pooling property) to a partitional signaling scheme that
achieves $1/2$ fraction of the expected utility of the former. We use this tool
in the proofs of both our PoE result and algorithmic result.

Conclusion: 该方法为多目标Stackelberg博弈中的收益操纵问题提供了有效的解决方案，通过平衡偏好获取和即时效用最大化，实现了领导者的长期收益优化。

Abstract: We study payoff manipulation in repeated multi-objective Stackelberg games,
where a leader may strategically influence a follower's deterministic best
response, e.g., by offering a share of their own payoff. We assume that the
follower's utility function, representing preferences over multiple objectives,
is unknown but linear, and its weight parameter must be inferred through
interaction. This introduces a sequential decision-making challenge for the
leader, who must balance preference elicitation with immediate utility
maximisation. We formalise this problem and propose manipulation policies based
on expected utility (EU) and long-term expected utility (longEU), which guide
the leader in selecting actions and offering incentives that trade off
short-term gains with long-term impact. We prove that under infinite repeated
interactions, longEU converges to the optimal manipulation. Empirical results
across benchmark environments demonstrate that our approach improves cumulative
leader utility while promoting mutually beneficial outcomes, all without
requiring explicit negotiation or prior knowledge of the follower's utility
function.
