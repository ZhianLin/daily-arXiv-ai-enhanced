### [1] [RetinexDual: Retinex-based Dual Nature Approach for Generalized Ultra-High-Definition Image Restoration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04797)
*Mohab Kishawy,Ali Abdellatif Hussein,Jun Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RetinexDual框架通过结合尺度注意力和频率域方法，有效解决了超高清图像恢复中的信息丢失和空间局部性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法（如下采样或频率域转换）在超高清图像恢复中存在信息丢失和局部性问题，需要更有效的解决方案。

Method: RetinexDual采用双分支设计：SAMBA（尺度注意力机制）处理反射分量，FIA（频率域适配器）校正颜色和光照。

Result: 在去雨、去模糊、去雾和低光增强任务中，RetinexDual在质量和数量上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: RetinexDual通过互补子网络设计，显著提升了超高清图像恢复的性能。

Abstract: Advancements in image sensing have elevated the importance of
Ultra-High-Definition Image Restoration (UHD IR). Traditional methods, such as
extreme downsampling or transformation from the spatial to the frequency
domain, encounter significant drawbacks: downsampling induces irreversible
information loss in UHD images, while our frequency analysis reveals that pure
frequency-domain approaches are ineffective for spatially confined image
artifacts, primarily due to the loss of degradation locality. To overcome these
limitations, we present RetinexDual, a novel Retinex theory-based framework
designed for generalized UHD IR tasks. RetinexDual leverages two complementary
sub-networks: the Scale-Attentive maMBA (SAMBA) and the Frequency Illumination
Adaptor (FIA). SAMBA, responsible for correcting the reflectance component,
utilizes a coarse-to-fine mechanism to overcome the causal modeling of mamba,
which effectively reduces artifacts and restores intricate details. On the
other hand, FIA ensures precise correction of color and illumination
distortions by operating in the frequency domain and leveraging the global
context provided by it. Evaluating RetinexDual on four UHD IR tasks, namely
deraining, deblurring, dehazing, and Low-Light Image Enhancement (LLIE), shows
that it outperforms recent methods qualitatively and quantitatively. Ablation
studies demonstrate the importance of employing distinct designs for each
branch in RetinexDual, as well as the effectiveness of its various components.

### [2] [ACM Multimedia Grand Challenge on ENT Endoscopy Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04801)
*Trong-Thuan Nguyen,Viet-Tham Huynh,Thao Thi Phuong Dao,Ha Nguyen Thi,Tien To Vu Thuy,Uyen Hanh Tran,Tam V. Nguyen,Thanh Dinh Le,Minh-Triet Tran*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文介绍了ENTRep挑战赛，旨在通过双语临床监督整合细粒度解剖分类与图像检索任务，以解决ENT内窥镜图像分析的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ENT内窥镜图像分析因设备、操作者差异及细微局部发现而受限，现有公共基准缺乏类似案例检索支持。

Method: 提出ENTRep挑战赛，包含专家标注的双语数据集，定义三项基准任务，并采用服务器端评分评估性能。

Result: 报告了表现最佳团队的结果，并提供了深入讨论。

Conclusion: ENTRep为ENT内窥镜分析提供了标准化基准，支持分类与检索任务，填补了现有空白。

Abstract: Automated analysis of endoscopic imagery is a critical yet underdeveloped
component of ENT (ear, nose, and throat) care, hindered by variability in
devices and operators, subtle and localized findings, and fine-grained
distinctions such as laterality and vocal-fold state. In addition to
classification, clinicians require reliable retrieval of similar cases, both
visually and through concise textual descriptions. These capabilities are
rarely supported by existing public benchmarks. To this end, we introduce
ENTRep, the ACM Multimedia 2025 Grand Challenge on ENT endoscopy analysis,
which integrates fine-grained anatomical classification with image-to-image and
text-to-image retrieval under bilingual (Vietnamese and English) clinical
supervision. Specifically, the dataset comprises expert-annotated images,
labeled for anatomical region and normal or abnormal status, and accompanied by
dual-language narrative descriptions. In addition, we define three benchmark
tasks, standardize the submission protocol, and evaluate performance on public
and private test splits using server-side scoring. Moreover, we report results
from the top-performing teams and provide an insight discussion.

### [3] [CoMAD: A Multiple-Teacher Self-Supervised Distillation Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04816)
*Sriram Mandalika,Lalitha V*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoMAD是一种轻量级、无参数的框架，通过整合多个自监督ViT模型的优势，将知识蒸馏到紧凑的学生网络中，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有自监督学习方法孤立训练、模型庞大且资源消耗高的问题，同时整合不同模型的互补知识。

Method: 采用不对称掩码策略，学生网络仅看到部分图像块，而教师网络接收不同掩码；通过线性适配器和层归一化对齐教师嵌入，并使用联合共识门控融合知识。

Result: 在ImageNet-1K上达到75.4% Top-1准确率，密集预测任务中表现优异，刷新了紧凑自监督蒸馏的SOTA。

Conclusion: CoMAD通过高效整合多教师知识，显著提升了紧凑模型的性能，为资源受限场景提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Numerous self-supervised learning paradigms, such as contrastive learning and
masked image modeling, learn powerful representations from unlabeled data but
are typically pretrained in isolation, overlooking complementary insights and
yielding large models that are impractical for resource-constrained deployment.
To overcome these challenges, we introduce Consensus-oriented Masked
Distillation (CoMAD), a lightweight, parameter-free framework that unifies
knowledge from multiple current state-of-the-art self-supervised Vision
Transformers into a compact student network. CoMAD distills from three
pretrained ViT-Base teachers, MAE, MoCo v3, and iBOT, each offering distinct
semantic and contextual priors. Rather than naively averaging teacher outputs,
we apply asymmetric masking: the student sees only 25 percent of patches while
each teacher receives a progressively lighter, unique mask, forcing the student
to interpolate missing features under richer contexts. Teacher embeddings are
aligned to the student's space via a linear adapter and layer normalization,
then fused through our joint consensus gating, which weights each token by
combining cosine affinity with inter-teacher agreement. The student is trained
with dual-level KL divergence on visible tokens and reconstructed feature maps,
capturing both local and global structure. On ImageNet-1K, CoMAD's ViT-Tiny
achieves 75.4 percent Top-1, an increment of 0.4 percent over the previous
state-of-the-art. In dense-prediction transfers, it attains 47.3 percent mIoU
on ADE20K, and 44.5 percent box average precision and 40.5 percent mask average
precision on MS-COCO, establishing a new state-of-the-art in compact SSL
distillation.

### [4] [Single-Step Reconstruction-Free Anomaly Detection and Segmentation via Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04818)
*Mehrdad Moradi,Marco Grasso,Bianca Maria Colosimo,Kamran Paynabar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于注意力扩散模型的无重建实时异常检测方法（RADAR），解决了传统重建方法的计算成本高、模式匹配不准确和噪声选择困难等问题，并在多个数据集上表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于扩散模型的异常检测方法存在计算成本高、重建不准确和噪声选择困难等问题，限制了其实际应用。

Method: RADAR直接通过扩散模型生成异常图，避免了重建过程，提高了检测效率和准确性。

Result: 在MVTec-AD和3D打印材料数据集上，RADAR的F1分数分别提高了7%和13%，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: RADAR是一种高效且准确的异常检测方法，适用于实时应用场景。

Abstract: Generative models have demonstrated significant success in anomaly detection
and segmentation over the past decade. Recently, diffusion models have emerged
as a powerful alternative, outperforming previous approaches such as GANs and
VAEs. In typical diffusion-based anomaly detection, a model is trained on
normal data, and during inference, anomalous images are perturbed to a
predefined intermediate step in the forward diffusion process. The
corresponding normal image is then reconstructed through iterative reverse
sampling.
  However, reconstruction-based approaches present three major challenges: (1)
the reconstruction process is computationally expensive due to multiple
sampling steps, making real-time applications impractical; (2) for complex or
subtle patterns, the reconstructed image may correspond to a different normal
pattern rather than the original input; and (3) Choosing an appropriate
intermediate noise level is challenging because it is application-dependent and
often assumes prior knowledge of anomalies, an assumption that does not hold in
unsupervised settings.
  We introduce Reconstruction-free Anomaly Detection with Attention-based
diffusion models in Real-time (RADAR), which overcomes the limitations of
reconstruction-based anomaly detection. Unlike current SOTA methods that
reconstruct the input image, RADAR directly produces anomaly maps from the
diffusion model, improving both detection accuracy and computational
efficiency. We evaluate RADAR on real-world 3D-printed material and the
MVTec-AD dataset. Our approach surpasses state-of-the-art diffusion-based and
statistical machine learning models across all key metrics, including accuracy,
precision, recall, and F1 score. Specifically, RADAR improves F1 score by 7% on
MVTec-AD and 13% on the 3D-printed material dataset compared to the next best
model.

### [5] [A deep learning approach to track eye movements based on events](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04827)
*Chirag Seth,Divya Naiken,Keyan Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究利用事件相机和深度学习算法（CNN_LSTM）准确追踪眼球运动，达到81%的准确率，未来计划通过LRP提升模型可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 眼球运动速度快（300°/s），传统高精度追踪设备昂贵，研究旨在开发低成本、高精度的算法，应用于VR/AR设备以提升用户体验。

Method: 采用CNN_LSTM模型，结合事件相机的输入数据，预测眼球中心位置（x, y）。

Result: 模型准确率约为81%，验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 研究成功开发了一种低成本的眼球追踪算法，未来可通过LRP进一步提升模型性能。

Abstract: This research project addresses the challenge of accurately tracking eye
movements during specific events by leveraging previous research. Given the
rapid movements of human eyes, which can reach speeds of 300{\deg}/s, precise
eye tracking typically requires expensive and high-speed cameras. Our primary
objective is to locate the eye center position (x, y) using inputs from an
event camera. Eye movement analysis has extensive applications in consumer
electronics, especially in VR and AR product development. Therefore, our
ultimate goal is to develop an interpretable and cost-effective algorithm using
deep learning methods to predict human attention, thereby improving device
comfort and enhancing overall user experience. To achieve this goal, we
explored various approaches, with the CNN\_LSTM model proving most effective,
achieving approximately 81\% accuracy. Additionally, we propose future work
focusing on Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) to further enhance the
model's interpretability and predictive performance.

### [6] [LuKAN: A Kolmogorov-Arnold Network Framework for 3D Human Motion Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04847)
*Md Zahidul Hasan,A. Ben Hamza,Nizar Bouguila*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LuKAN模型基于Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks（KANs）和Lucas多项式激活，通过离散小波变换和空间投影层高效预测3D人体运动，平衡了精度与计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在3D人体运动预测中难以平衡精度与计算效率，LuKAN旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 使用离散小波变换编码时间信息，空间投影层捕捉关节依赖关系，KAN层通过Lucas多项式高效逼近函数，最后通过逆小波变换重建运动序列。

Result: 在三个基准数据集上表现优异，定量和定性评估均优于基线模型，且计算高效。

Conclusion: LuKAN在3D人体运动预测中实现了精度与效率的平衡，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: The goal of 3D human motion prediction is to forecast future 3D poses of the
human body based on historical motion data. Existing methods often face
limitations in achieving a balance between prediction accuracy and
computational efficiency. In this paper, we present LuKAN, an effective model
based on Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) with Lucas polynomial activations.
Our model first applies the discrete wavelet transform to encode temporal
information in the input motion sequence. Then, a spatial projection layer is
used to capture inter-joint dependencies, ensuring structural consistency of
the human body. At the core of LuKAN is the Temporal Dependency Learner, which
employs a KAN layer parameterized by Lucas polynomials for efficient function
approximation. These polynomials provide computational efficiency and an
enhanced capability to handle oscillatory behaviors. Finally, the inverse
discrete wavelet transform reconstructs motion sequences in the time domain,
generating temporally coherent predictions. Extensive experiments on three
benchmark datasets demonstrate the competitive performance of our model
compared to strong baselines, as evidenced by both quantitative and qualitative
evaluations. Moreover, its compact architecture coupled with the linear
recurrence of Lucas polynomials, ensures computational efficiency.

### [7] [VER-Bench: Evaluating MLLMs on Reasoning with Fine-Grained Visual Evidence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04852)
*Chenhui Qiang,Zhaoyang Wei,Xumeng Han Zipeng Wang,Siyao Li,Xiangyuan Lan,Jianbin Jiao,Zhenjun Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VER-Bench是一个评估MLLMs在细粒度视觉线索识别和复杂推理能力的新框架，填补了现有基准的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准在评估MLLMs的视觉能力时，要么缺乏深度推理，要么忽视细微线索，而真正的视觉理解依赖于对细微细节的解析。

Method: 提出VER-Bench框架，包含374个精心设计的问题，覆盖多种推理类型，并附带结构化证据（视觉线索和推理过程）。

Result: 揭示了当前模型在提取细微视觉证据和构建基于证据的推理方面的局限性。

Conclusion: 需要增强模型在细粒度视觉证据提取、整合和推理方面的能力，以实现真正的视觉理解和类人分析。

Abstract: With the rapid development of MLLMs, evaluating their visual capabilities has
become increasingly crucial. Current benchmarks primarily fall into two main
types: basic perception benchmarks, which focus on local details but lack deep
reasoning (e.g., "what is in the image?"), and mainstream reasoning benchmarks,
which concentrate on prominent image elements but may fail to assess subtle
clues requiring intricate analysis. However, profound visual understanding and
complex reasoning depend more on interpreting subtle, inconspicuous local
details than on perceiving salient, macro-level objects. These details, though
occupying minimal image area, often contain richer, more critical information
for robust analysis. To bridge this gap, we introduce the VER-Bench, a novel
framework to evaluate MLLMs' ability to: 1) identify fine-grained visual clues,
often occupying on average just 0.25% of the image area; 2) integrate these
clues with world knowledge for complex reasoning. Comprising 374 carefully
designed questions across Geospatial, Temporal, Situational, Intent, System
State, and Symbolic reasoning, each question in VER-Bench is accompanied by
structured evidence: visual clues and question-related reasoning derived from
them. VER-Bench reveals current models' limitations in extracting subtle visual
evidence and constructing evidence-based arguments, highlighting the need to
enhance models's capabilities in fine-grained visual evidence extraction,
integration, and reasoning for genuine visual understanding and human-like
analysis. Dataset and additional materials are available

### [8] [Dual-Stream Attention with Multi-Modal Queries for Object Detection in Transportation Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04868)
*Noreen Anwar,Guillaume-Alexandre Bilodeau,Wassim Bouachir*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DAMM提出了一种双流注意力与多模态查询框架，通过查询适应和结构化交叉注意力提升目标检测的精度和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer-based目标检测器在遮挡、细粒度定位和计算效率方面存在问题，DAMM旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 引入三种查询（视觉语言模型的外观查询、多边形嵌入的位置查询、随机学习查询）和双流交叉注意力模块，分别优化语义和空间特征。

Result: 在四个基准测试中达到最先进的AP和召回率。

Conclusion: 多模态查询适应和双流注意力有效提升了目标检测性能。

Abstract: Transformer-based object detectors often struggle with occlusions,
fine-grained localization, and computational inefficiency caused by fixed
queries and dense attention. We propose DAMM, Dual-stream Attention with
Multi-Modal queries, a novel framework introducing both query adaptation and
structured cross-attention for improved accuracy and efficiency. DAMM
capitalizes on three types of queries: appearance-based queries from
vision-language models, positional queries using polygonal embeddings, and
random learned queries for general scene coverage. Furthermore, a dual-stream
cross-attention module separately refines semantic and spatial features,
boosting localization precision in cluttered scenes. We evaluated DAMM on four
challenging benchmarks, and it achieved state-of-the-art performance in average
precision (AP) and recall, demonstrating the effectiveness of multi-modal query
adaptation and dual-stream attention. Source code is at:

### [9] [Revealing Temporal Label Noise in Multimodal Hateful Video Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04900)

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文研究了多模态仇恨视频中标签噪声的影响，通过精细时间标注分析仇恨内容与非仇恨内容的分布，发现粗粒度标注会混淆模型决策。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线多媒体内容中仇恨言论的快速传播带来了社会和监管挑战，现有方法依赖粗粒度视频级标注，忽略了仇恨内容的时间粒度。

Method: 利用HateMM和MultiHateClip数据集，通过时间戳裁剪仇恨视频段，分析仇恨与非仇恨内容的分布及语义重叠。

Result: 实验表明时间戳噪声会改变模型决策边界并降低分类置信度，揭示了仇恨言论表达的时间依赖性。

Conclusion: 研究强调了时间感知模型和基准的必要性，以提高多模态仇恨视频检测的鲁棒性和可解释性。

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of online multimedia content has intensified the
spread of hate speech, presenting critical societal and regulatory challenges.
While recent work has advanced multimodal hateful video detection, most
approaches rely on coarse, video-level annotations that overlook the temporal
granularity of hateful content. This introduces substantial label noise, as
videos annotated as hateful often contain long non-hateful segments. In this
paper, we investigate the impact of such label ambiguity through a fine-grained
approach. Specifically, we trim hateful videos from the HateMM and
MultiHateClip English datasets using annotated timestamps to isolate explicitly
hateful segments. We then conduct an exploratory analysis of these trimmed
segments to examine the distribution and characteristics of both hateful and
non-hateful content. This analysis highlights the degree of semantic overlap
and the confusion introduced by coarse, video-level annotations. Finally,
controlled experiments demonstrated that time-stamp noise fundamentally alters
model decision boundaries and weakens classification confidence, highlighting
the inherent context dependency and temporal continuity of hate speech
expression. Our findings provide new insights into the temporal dynamics of
multimodal hateful videos and highlight the need for temporally aware models
and benchmarks for improved robustness and interpretability. Code and data are

### [10] [Test-Time Adaptation for Video Highlight Detection Using Meta-Auxiliary Learning and Cross-Modality Hallucinations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04924)
*Zahidul Islam,Sujoy Paul,Mrigank Rochan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Highlight-TTA是一种测试时自适应框架，通过动态调整模型以适应每个测试视频的独特特征，提升视频高光检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有高光检测方法因使用固定模型，无法适应不同测试视频的多样性，导致性能下降。

Method: 提出Highlight-TTA框架，结合跨模态幻觉辅助任务，通过元辅助训练方案动态优化模型。

Result: 在三个基准数据集上的实验表明，Highlight-TTA显著提升了现有模型的性能。

Conclusion: Highlight-TTA通过测试时自适应，有效解决了高光检测模型的泛化问题。

Abstract: Existing video highlight detection methods, although advanced, struggle to
generalize well to all test videos. These methods typically employ a generic
highlight detection model for each test video, which is suboptimal as it fails
to account for the unique characteristics and variations of individual test
videos. Such fixed models do not adapt to the diverse content, styles, or audio
and visual qualities present in new, unseen test videos, leading to reduced
highlight detection performance. In this paper, we propose Highlight-TTA, a
test-time adaptation framework for video highlight detection that addresses
this limitation by dynamically adapting the model during testing to better
align with the specific characteristics of each test video, thereby improving
generalization and highlight detection performance. Highlight-TTA is jointly
optimized with an auxiliary task, cross-modality hallucinations, alongside the
primary highlight detection task. We utilize a meta-auxiliary training scheme
to enable effective adaptation through the auxiliary task while enhancing the
primary task. During testing, we adapt the trained model using the auxiliary
task on the test video to further enhance its highlight detection performance.
Extensive experiments with three state-of-the-art highlight detection models
and three benchmark datasets show that the introduction of Highlight-TTA to
these models improves their performance, yielding superior results.

### [11] [Extending Foundational Monocular Depth Estimators to Fisheye Cameras with Calibration Tokens](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04928)
*Suchisrit Gangopadhyay,Jung-Hee Kim,Xien Chen,Patrick Rim,Hyoungseob Park,Alex Wong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种方法，将基于透视图像训练的单目深度估计器（FMDEs）扩展到鱼眼图像，通过校准令牌调整潜在嵌入分布，避免重新训练或微调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FMDEs在鱼眼图像上因相机参数变化（如内参、畸变）导致深度估计错误，需解决分布偏移问题。

Method: 引入校准令牌作为轻量级适配机制，调整潜在嵌入分布，利用自监督学习从透视图像生成鱼眼图像进行训练。

Result: 在室内外场景中，使用单一令牌集显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法无需鱼眼图像数据，通过潜在空间调制有效解决了FMDEs在鱼眼图像上的分布偏移问题。

Abstract: We propose a method to extend foundational monocular depth estimators
(FMDEs), trained on perspective images, to fisheye images. Despite being
trained on tens of millions of images, FMDEs are susceptible to the covariate
shift introduced by changes in camera calibration (intrinsic, distortion)
parameters, leading to erroneous depth estimates. Our method aligns the
distribution of latent embeddings encoding fisheye images to those of
perspective images, enabling the reuse of FMDEs for fisheye cameras without
retraining or finetuning. To this end, we introduce a set of Calibration Tokens
as a light-weight adaptation mechanism that modulates the latent embeddings for
alignment. By exploiting the already expressive latent space of FMDEs, we posit
that modulating their embeddings avoids the negative impact of artifacts and
loss introduced in conventional recalibration or map projection to a canonical
reference frame in the image space. Our method is self-supervised and does not
require fisheye images but leverages publicly available large-scale perspective
image datasets. This is done by recalibrating perspective images to fisheye
images, and enforcing consistency between their estimates during training. We
evaluate our approach with several FMDEs, on both indoors and outdoors, where
we consistently improve over state-of-the-art methods using a single set of
tokens for both. Code available at:

TL;DR: 本文描述了一种基于ImageNet 2012数据集训练的神经网络，采用新方法达到98.3%的准确率和99.69%的Top-1率，并分析了未达100%准确率的原因。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索新方法在ImageNet数据集上的性能表现，并研究影响准确率的潜在问题。

Method: 使用前馈人工神经网络，结合新方法对ImageNet 2012数据集进行训练。

Result: 模型达到98.3%的准确率和99.69%的Top-1率，完美分类285.9个标签，参数规模为322,430,160。

Conclusion: 未达100%准确率的原因可能是数据集中的双标签问题，即存在重复图像但标签不同。

Abstract: In this paper, we describe a feedforward artificial neural network trained on
the ImageNet 2012 contest dataset [7] with the new method of [5] to an accuracy
rate of 98.3% with a 99.69 Top-1 rate, and an average of 285.9 labels that are
perfectly classified over the 10 batch partitions of the dataset. The best
performing model uses 322,430,160 parameters, with 4 decimal places precision.
We conjecture that the reason our model does not achieve a 100% accuracy rate
is due to a double-labeling problem, by which there are duplicate images in the
dataset with different labels.

### [13] [Accelerating Conditional Prompt Learning via Masked Image Modeling for Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04942)
*Phuoc-Nguyen Bui,Khanh-Binh Nguyen,Hyunseung Choo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ProMIM是一个增强视觉语言模型（VLM）提示学习的框架，通过掩码图像建模（MIM）提升泛化能力，减少过拟合。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有提示学习方法（如CoOp和CoCoOp）在适应新任务时容易过拟合已知类别，泛化能力不足。

Method: ProMIM通过掩码可见图像块生成实例条件提示，增强特征鲁棒性，无需改变现有方法的核心架构。

Result: 实验表明，ProMIM在零样本和小样本分类任务中显著提升泛化性能，计算成本几乎不增加。

Conclusion: ProMIM为视觉语言应用提供了一种轻量级、高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP excel in zero-shot learning but often
require resource-intensive training to adapt to new tasks. Prompt learning
techniques, such as CoOp and CoCoOp, offer efficient adaptation but tend to
overfit to known classes, limiting generalization to unseen categories. We
introduce ProMIM, a plug-and-play framework that enhances conditional prompt
learning by integrating masked image modeling (MIM) into existing VLM
pipelines. ProMIM leverages a simple yet effective masking strategy to generate
robust, instance-conditioned prompts, seamlessly augmenting methods like CoOp
and CoCoOp without altering their core architectures. By masking only visible
image patches and using these representations to guide prompt generation,
ProMIM improves feature robustness and mitigates overfitting, all while
introducing negligible additional computational cost. Extensive experiments
across zero-shot and few-shot classification tasks demonstrate that ProMIM
consistently boosts generalization performance when plugged into existing
approaches, providing a practical, lightweight solution for real-world
vision-language applications.

### [14] [TRKT: Weakly Supervised Dynamic Scene Graph Generation with Temporal-enhanced Relation-aware Knowledge Transferring](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04943)
*Zhu Xu,Ting Lei,Zhimin Li,Guan Wang,Qingchao Chen,Yuxin Peng,Yang liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为TRKT的方法，用于解决弱监督动态场景图生成（WS-DSGG）中外部目标检测器带来的问题，通过关系感知知识挖掘和双流融合模块提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的WS-DSGG方法依赖外部目标检测器，但这些检测器在动态、关系感知的场景中表现不佳，导致定位不准确和低置信度提案。

Method: TRKT方法包括关系感知知识挖掘（通过类别特定注意力图和帧间注意力增强）和双流融合模块（整合注意力图以优化目标定位）。

Result: 在Action Genome数据集上，TRKT取得了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: TRKT通过关系感知和动态场景的知识增强，显著提升了WS-DSGG的性能。

Abstract: Dynamic Scene Graph Generation (DSGG) aims to create a scene graph for each
video frame by detecting objects and predicting their relationships. Weakly
Supervised DSGG (WS-DSGG) reduces annotation workload by using an unlocalized
scene graph from a single frame per video for training. Existing WS-DSGG
methods depend on an off-the-shelf external object detector to generate pseudo
labels for subsequent DSGG training. However, detectors trained on static,
object-centric images struggle in dynamic, relation-aware scenarios required
for DSGG, leading to inaccurate localization and low-confidence proposals. To
address the challenges posed by external object detectors in WS-DSGG, we
propose a Temporal-enhanced Relation-aware Knowledge Transferring (TRKT)
method, which leverages knowledge to enhance detection in relation-aware
dynamic scenarios. TRKT is built on two key components:(1)Relation-aware
knowledge mining: we first employ object and relation class decoders that
generate category-specific attention maps to highlight both object regions and
interactive areas. Then we propose an Inter-frame Attention Augmentation
strategy that exploits optical flow for neighboring frames to enhance the
attention maps, making them motion-aware and robust to motion blur. This step
yields relation- and motion-aware knowledge mining for WS-DSGG. (2) we
introduce a Dual-stream Fusion Module that integrates category-specific
attention maps into external detections to refine object localization and boost
confidence scores for object proposals. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
TRKT achieves state-of-the-art performance on Action Genome dataset. Our code
is avaliable at https://github.com/XZPKU/TRKT.git.

Result: AdvDINO减少了图像特异性偏差，发现了具有不同蛋白质组特征和预后意义的表型簇，并提升了生存预测性能。

Conclusion: AdvDINO不仅适用于生物医学图像，还可推广到其他存在域偏移和标注数据有限的领域。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a powerful approach for
learning visual representations without manual annotations. However, the
robustness of standard SSL methods to domain shift -- systematic differences
across data sources -- remains uncertain, posing an especially critical
challenge in biomedical imaging where batch effects can obscure true biological
signals. We present AdvDINO, a domain-adversarial self-supervised learning
framework that integrates a gradient reversal layer into the DINOv2
architecture to promote domain-invariant feature learning. Applied to a
real-world cohort of six-channel multiplex immunofluorescence (mIF) whole slide
images from non-small cell lung cancer patients, AdvDINO mitigates
slide-specific biases to learn more robust and biologically meaningful
representations than non-adversarial baselines. Across $>5.46$ million mIF
image tiles, the model uncovers phenotype clusters with distinct proteomic
profiles and prognostic significance, and improves survival prediction in
attention-based multiple instance learning. While demonstrated on mIF data,
AdvDINO is broadly applicable to other imaging domains -- including radiology,
remote sensing, and autonomous driving -- where domain shift and limited
annotated data hinder model generalization and interpretability.

Motivation: 现有方法依赖资源密集的离线增量学习或密集标注支持数据，限制了实用性。HOW-Seg 旨在解决这些限制。

Method: 构建查询数据的类别原型，利用稀疏人类标注指导分割，引入层次化原型消歧机制和密集条件随机场（CRF）优化标签分配。

Conclusion: HOW-Seg 通过人机交互动态优化预测，实现了高质量的分割效果，适用于开放世界场景。

Abstract: Open-world point cloud semantic segmentation (OW-Seg) aims to predict point
labels of both base and novel classes in real-world scenarios. However,
existing methods rely on resource-intensive offline incremental learning or
densely annotated support data, limiting their practicality. To address these
limitations, we propose HOW-Seg, the first human-in-the-loop framework for
OW-Seg. Specifically, we construct class prototypes, the fundamental
segmentation units, directly on the query data, avoiding the prototype bias
caused by intra-class distribution shifts between the support and query data.
By leveraging sparse human annotations as guidance, HOW-Seg enables
prototype-based segmentation for both base and novel classes. Considering the
lack of granularity of initial prototypes, we introduce a hierarchical
prototype disambiguation mechanism to refine ambiguous prototypes, which
correspond to annotations of different classes. To further enrich contextual
awareness, we employ a dense conditional random field (CRF) upon the refined
prototypes to optimize their label assignments. Through iterative human
feedback, HOW-Seg dynamically improves its predictions, achieving high-quality
segmentation for both base and novel classes. Experiments demonstrate that with
sparse annotations (e.g., one-novel-class-one-click), HOW-Seg matches or
surpasses the state-of-the-art generalized few-shot segmentation (GFS-Seg)
method under the 5-shot setting. When using advanced backbones (e.g.,
Stratified Transformer) and denser annotations (e.g., 10 clicks per sub-scene),
HOW-Seg achieves 85.27% mIoU on S3DIS and 66.37% mIoU on ScanNetv2,
significantly outperforming alternatives.

TL;DR: 3D高斯泼溅（3DGS）因其高效的渲染性能成为新颖视图合成的竞争性方法，但现有方法中高斯权重均等化易导致过拟合，特别是在稀疏视图场景中。本文提出通过学习不确定性自适应调整高斯权重，提升渲染质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决3DGS在稀疏视图场景中因高斯权重均等化导致的过拟合问题，提升渲染质量。

Method: 通过学习高斯的不确定性，指导高斯透明度的可微更新，并采用软可微丢弃正则化策略，优化高斯投影和混合过程。

Conclusion: 自适应高斯权重调整和不确定性学习显著提升了稀疏视图下的渲染质量，减少了所需的高斯数量。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has become a competitive approach for novel view
synthesis (NVS) due to its advanced rendering efficiency through 3D Gaussian
projection and blending. However, Gaussians are treated equally weighted for
rendering in most 3DGS methods, making them prone to overfitting, which is
particularly the case in sparse-view scenarios. To address this, we investigate
how adaptive weighting of Gaussians affects rendering quality, which is
characterised by learned uncertainties proposed. This learned uncertainty
serves two key purposes: first, it guides the differentiable update of Gaussian
opacity while preserving the 3DGS pipeline integrity; second, the uncertainty
undergoes soft differentiable dropout regularisation, which strategically
transforms the original uncertainty into continuous drop probabilities that
govern the final Gaussian projection and blending process for rendering.
Extensive experimental results over widely adopted datasets demonstrate that
our method outperforms rivals in sparse-view 3D synthesis, achieving higher
quality reconstruction with fewer Gaussians in most datasets compared to
existing sparse-view approaches, e.g., compared to DropGaussian, our method
achieves 3.27\% PSNR improvements on the MipNeRF 360 dataset.

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在Waymo Open Dataset上实现了更高的mAP和召回率，优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 可变尺寸画布帧和可选帧率进一步优化了质量与成本的权衡，提升了实时感知性能。

Abstract: Real-time perception on edge platforms faces a core challenge: executing
high-resolution object detection under stringent latency constraints on limited
computing resources. Canvas-based attention scheduling was proposed in earlier
work as a mechanism to reduce the resource demands of perception subsystems. It
consolidates areas of interest in an input data frame onto a smaller area,
called a canvas frame, that can be processed at the requisite frame rate. This
paper extends prior canvas-based attention scheduling literature by (i)
allowing for variable-size canvas frames and (ii) employing selectable canvas
frame rates that may depart from the original data frame rate. We evaluate our
solution by running YOLOv11, as the perception module, on an NVIDIA Jetson Orin
Nano to inspect video frames from the Waymo Open Dataset. Our results show that
the additional degrees of freedom improve the attainable quality/cost
trade-offs, thereby allowing for a consistently higher mean average precision
(mAP) and recall with respect to the state of the art.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统扩散图像压缩方法存在解码延迟高和保真度低的缺点，SODEC旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 利用预训练的VAE模型生成信息丰富的潜在表示，并用单步解码替代迭代去噪过程；引入保真度引导模块和速率退火训练策略。

Result: SODEC在率失真感知性能上显著优于现有方法，解码速度提升20倍以上。

Conclusion: SODEC通过单步解码和保真度优化，实现了高效且高质量的图像压缩。

Abstract: Diffusion-based image compression has demonstrated impressive perceptual
performance. However, it suffers from two critical drawbacks: (1) excessive
decoding latency due to multi-step sampling, and (2) poor fidelity resulting
from over-reliance on generative priors. To address these issues, we propose
SODEC, a novel single-step diffusion image compression model. We argue that in
image compression, a sufficiently informative latent renders multi-step
refinement unnecessary. Based on this insight, we leverage a pre-trained
VAE-based model to produce latents with rich information, and replace the
iterative denoising process with a single-step decoding. Meanwhile, to improve
fidelity, we introduce the fidelity guidance module, encouraging output that is
faithful to the original image. Furthermore, we design the rate annealing
training strategy to enable effective training under extremely low bitrates.
Extensive experiments show that SODEC significantly outperforms existing
methods, achieving superior rate-distortion-perception performance. Moreover,
compared to previous diffusion-based compression models, SODEC improves
decoding speed by more than 20$\times$. Code is released at:

Motivation: 现有基于学习的深度补全模型在分布外（OOD）场景中性能显著下降，而基础模型在大规模训练下表现出色。

Result: 在16个数据集上的广泛评估中，框架在OOD场景中表现优异，超越现有方法。

Conclusion: 该框架显著提升了深度补全的鲁棒性，为相关领域提供了新思路。

Abstract: Depth completion is a pivotal challenge in computer vision, aiming at
reconstructing the dense depth map from a sparse one, typically with a paired
RGB image. Existing learning based models rely on carefully prepared but
limited data, leading to significant performance degradation in
out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. Recent foundation models have demonstrated
exceptional robustness in monocular depth estimation through large-scale
training, and using such models to enhance the robustness of depth completion
models is a promising solution. In this work, we propose a novel depth
completion framework that leverages depth foundation models to attain
remarkable robustness without large-scale training. Specifically, we leverage a
depth foundation model to extract environmental cues, including structural and
semantic context, from RGB images to guide the propagation of sparse depth
information into missing regions. We further design a dual-space propagation
approach, without any learnable parameters, to effectively propagates sparse
depth in both 3D and 2D spaces to maintain geometric structure and local
consistency. To refine the intricate structure, we introduce a learnable
correction module to progressively adjust the depth prediction towards the real
depth. We train our model on the NYUv2 and KITTI datasets as in-distribution
datasets and extensively evaluate the framework on 16 other datasets. Our
framework performs remarkably well in the OOD scenarios and outperforms
existing state-of-the-art depth completion methods. Our models are released in

Conclusion: 模态分离框架有效解决了模态间隙问题，显著提升了无监督领域适应的性能。

Abstract: Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) enables models trained on a labeled
source domain to handle new unlabeled domains. Recently, pre-trained
vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated promising zero-shot performance
by leveraging semantic information to facilitate target tasks. By aligning
vision and text embeddings, VLMs have shown notable success in bridging domain
gaps. However, inherent differences naturally exist between modalities, which
is known as modality gap. Our findings reveal that direct UDA with the presence
of modality gap only transfers modality-invariant knowledge, leading to
suboptimal target performance. To address this limitation, we propose a unified
modality separation framework that accommodates both modality-specific and
modality-invariant components. During training, different modality components
are disentangled from VLM features then handled separately in a unified manner.
At test time, modality-adaptive ensemble weights are automatically determined
to maximize the synergy of different components. To evaluate instance-level
modality characteristics, we design a modality discrepancy metric to categorize
samples into modality-invariant, modality-specific, and uncertain ones. The
modality-invariant samples are exploited to facilitate cross-modal alignment,
while uncertain ones are annotated to enhance model capabilities. Building upon
prompt tuning techniques, our methods achieve up to 9% performance gain with 9
times of computational efficiencies. Extensive experiments and analysis across
various backbones, baselines, datasets and adaptation settings demonstrate the
efficacy of our design.

Motivation: 探索快速学习如何通过熟悉性训练在深度神经网络的早期层中引入对全局上下文的敏感性。

Method: 使用Vision Transformer（ViT）自编码器和LoRA实现快速权重，模拟快速学习过程。

Result: 研究发现ViT自编码器的自注意力机制与神经回路模型相似，熟悉性训练使早期层与顶层表征对齐，并扩大自注意力范围。

Conclusion: 熟悉性训练在分层网络中引入全局敏感性，混合快速和慢速权重架构为研究大脑快速全局上下文学习提供了计算模型。

Abstract: Recent neurophysiological studies have revealed that the early visual cortex
can rapidly learn global image context, as evidenced by a sparsification of
population responses and a reduction in mean activity when exposed to familiar
versus novel image contexts. This phenomenon has been attributed primarily to
local recurrent interactions, rather than changes in feedforward or feedback
pathways, supported by both empirical findings and circuit-level modeling.
Recurrent neural circuits capable of simulating these effects have been shown
to reshape the geometry of neural manifolds, enhancing robustness and
invariance to irrelevant variations. In this study, we employ a Vision
Transformer (ViT)-based autoencoder to investigate, from a functional
perspective, how familiarity training can induce sensitivity to global context
in the early layers of a deep neural network. We hypothesize that rapid
learning operates via fast weights, which encode transient or short-term memory
traces, and we explore the use of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to implement such
fast weights within each Transformer layer. Our results show that (1) The
proposed ViT-based autoencoder's self-attention circuit performs a manifold
transform similar to a neural circuit model of the familiarity effect. (2)
Familiarity training aligns latent representations in early layers with those
in the top layer that contains global context information. (3) Familiarity
training broadens the self-attention scope within the remembered image context.
(4) These effects are significantly amplified by LoRA-based fast weights.
Together, these findings suggest that familiarity training introduces global
sensitivity to earlier layers in a hierarchical network, and that a hybrid
fast-and-slow weight architecture may provide a viable computational model for
studying rapid global context learning in the brain.

Motivation: 预训练视觉语言模型在遮挡场景中因忽视细粒度属性信息而表现不佳，需改进。

Method: 提出AG-ReID框架，利用预训练模型提取细粒度属性，通过生成属性伪标签和双引导机制结合整体与细粒度信息。

Result: 在多个数据集上达到SOTA，显著提升遮挡和细微差异处理能力，标准场景表现仍具竞争力。

Conclusion: AG-ReID有效解决了遮挡和细微属性差异问题，为行人重识别任务提供了新思路。

Abstract: Person re-identification (Re-ID) aims to match person images across different
camera views, with occluded Re-ID addressing scenarios where pedestrians are
partially visible. While pre-trained vision-language models have shown
effectiveness in Re-ID tasks, they face significant challenges in occluded
scenarios by focusing on holistic image semantics while neglecting fine-grained
attribute information. This limitation becomes particularly evident when
dealing with partially occluded pedestrians or when distinguishing between
individuals with subtle appearance differences. To address this limitation, we
propose Attribute-Guide ReID (AG-ReID), a novel framework that leverages
pre-trained models' inherent capabilities to extract fine-grained semantic
attributes without additional data or annotations. Our framework operates
through a two-stage process: first generating attribute pseudo-labels that
capture subtle visual characteristics, then introducing a dual-guidance
mechanism that combines holistic and fine-grained attribute information to
enhance image feature extraction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
AG-ReID achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple widely-used Re-ID
datasets, showing significant improvements in handling occlusions and subtle
attribute differences while maintaining competitive performance on standard
Re-ID scenarios.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为CRAM的方法，通过压缩视频数据并动态刷新视频编码，解决了视频持续学习中的高内存需求问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频持续学习面临高内存需求挑战，尤其是长视频和持续流数据与常见的内存缓冲区大小限制相冲突。

Method: 使用压缩视觉技术存储视频编码而非原始数据，并通过动态刷新编码来缓解灾难性遗忘问题。

Result: 在EpicKitchens-100和Kinetics-700等大规模视频数据集上，CRAM方法显著减少了内存占用并优于现有技术。

Conclusion: CRAM为视频持续学习提供了一种高效且内存友好的解决方案。

Abstract: Continual learning (CL) promises to allow neural networks to learn from
continuous streams of inputs, instead of IID (independent and identically
distributed) sampling, which requires random access to a full dataset. This
would allow for much smaller storage requirements and self-sufficiency of
deployed systems that cope with natural distribution shifts, similarly to
biological learning. We focus on video CL employing a rehearsal-based approach,
which reinforces past samples from a memory buffer. We posit that part of the
reason why practical video CL is challenging is the high memory requirements of
video, further exacerbated by long-videos and continual streams, which are at
odds with the common rehearsal-buffer size constraints. To address this, we
propose to use compressed vision, i.e. store video codes (embeddings) instead
of raw inputs, and train a video classifier by IID sampling from this rolling
buffer. Training a video compressor online (so not depending on any pre-trained
networks) means that it is also subject to catastrophic forgetting. We propose
a scheme to deal with this forgetting by refreshing video codes, which requires
careful decompression with a previous version of the network and recompression
with a new one. We name our method Continually Refreshed Amodal Memory (CRAM).
We expand current video CL benchmarks to large-scale settings, namely
EpicKitchens-100 and Kinetics-700, storing thousands of relatively long videos
in under 2 GB, and demonstrate empirically that our video CL method outperforms
prior art with a significantly reduced memory footprint.

Result: 实验表明MCDRL在分割准确性和泛化性上优于其他方法。

Conclusion: MCDRL有效解决了医学图像分割中的领域泛化问题，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs), such as CLIP, have demonstrated remarkable
zero-shot capabilities in various computer vision tasks. However, their
application to medical imaging remains challenging due to the high variability
and complexity of medical data. Specifically, medical images often exhibit
significant domain shifts caused by various confounders, including equipment
differences, procedure artifacts, and imaging modes, which can lead to poor
generalization when models are applied to unseen domains. To address this
limitation, we propose Multimodal Causal-Driven Representation Learning
(MCDRL), a novel framework that integrates causal inference with the VLM to
tackle domain generalization in medical image segmentation. MCDRL is
implemented in two steps: first, it leverages CLIP's cross-modal capabilities
to identify candidate lesion regions and construct a confounder dictionary
through text prompts, specifically designed to represent domain-specific
variations; second, it trains a causal intervention network that utilizes this
dictionary to identify and eliminate the influence of these domain-specific
variations while preserving the anatomical structural information critical for
segmentation tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MCDRL consistently
outperforms competing methods, yielding superior segmentation accuracy and
exhibiting robust generalizability.

Conclusion: AU-IQA数据集为AI-UGC质量评估提供了基准，推动了该领域的发展。

Abstract: AI-based image enhancement techniques have been widely adopted in various
visual applications, significantly improving the perceptual quality of
user-generated content (UGC). However, the lack of specialized quality
assessment models has become a significant limiting factor in this field,
limiting user experience and hindering the advancement of enhancement methods.
While perceptual quality assessment methods have shown strong performance on
UGC and AIGC individually, their effectiveness on AI-enhanced UGC (AI-UGC)
which blends features from both, remains largely unexplored. To address this
gap, we construct AU-IQA, a benchmark dataset comprising 4,800 AI-UGC images
produced by three representative enhancement types which include
super-resolution, low-light enhancement, and denoising. On this dataset, we
further evaluate a range of existing quality assessment models, including
traditional IQA methods and large multimodal models. Finally, we provide a
comprehensive analysis of how well current approaches perform in assessing the
perceptual quality of AI-UGC. The access link to the AU-IQA is

Motivation: 皮肤癌是全球最常见的癌症，早期诊断和治疗对提高患者生存率至关重要。手动生成SOAP笔记耗时且易导致医生疲劳，因此需要自动化解决方案。

Method: 采用弱监督多模态框架，结合病变图像和稀疏临床文本生成SOAP笔记，减少对大量标注数据的依赖。

Result: 性能与GPT-4o、Claude和DeepSeek Janus Pro相当，并引入了MedConceptEval和CCS两项新指标评估临床相关性。

Conclusion: skin-SOAP框架能有效减轻临床医生负担，提升文档生成效率，同时保持临床相关性。

Abstract: Skin carcinoma is the most prevalent form of cancer globally, accounting for
over $8 billion in annual healthcare expenditures. Early diagnosis, accurate
and timely treatment are critical to improving patient survival rates. In
clinical settings, physicians document patient visits using detailed SOAP
(Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan) notes. However, manually
generating these notes is labor-intensive and contributes to clinician burnout.
In this work, we propose skin-SOAP, a weakly supervised multimodal framework to
generate clinically structured SOAP notes from limited inputs, including lesion
images and sparse clinical text. Our approach reduces reliance on manual
annotations, enabling scalable, clinically grounded documentation while
alleviating clinician burden and reducing the need for large annotated data.
Our method achieves performance comparable to GPT-4o, Claude, and DeepSeek
Janus Pro across key clinical relevance metrics. To evaluate this clinical
relevance, we introduce two novel metrics MedConceptEval and Clinical Coherence
Score (CCS) which assess semantic alignment with expert medical concepts and
input features, respectively.

Conclusion: SCSSIM是一种有效的结构评估工具，有助于生成模型的开发和评估，确保场景构图的完整性。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative AI models necessitates novel methods for
evaluating image quality that extend beyond human perception. A critical
concern for these models is the preservation of an image's underlying Scene
Composition Structure (SCS), which defines the geometric relationships among
objects and the background, their relative positions, sizes, orientations, etc.
Maintaining SCS integrity is paramount for ensuring faithful and structurally
accurate GenAI outputs. Traditional image similarity metrics often fall short
in assessing SCS. Pixel-level approaches are overly sensitive to minor visual
noise, while perception-based metrics prioritize human aesthetic appeal,
neither adequately capturing structural fidelity. Furthermore, recent
neural-network-based metrics introduce training overheads and potential
generalization issues. We introduce the SCS Similarity Index Measure (SCSSIM),
a novel, analytical, and training-free metric that quantifies SCS preservation
by exploiting statistical measures derived from the Cuboidal hierarchical
partitioning of images, robustly capturing non-object-based structural
relationships. Our experiments demonstrate SCSSIM's high invariance to
non-compositional distortions, accurately reflecting unchanged SCS. Conversely,
it shows a strong monotonic decrease for compositional distortions, precisely
indicating when SCS has been altered. Compared to existing metrics, SCSSIM
exhibits superior properties for structural evaluation, making it an invaluable
tool for developing and evaluating generative models, ensuring the integrity of
scene composition.

Abstract: Recently, research interest in person re-identification (ReID) has
increasingly focused on video-based scenarios, which are essential for robust
surveillance and security in varied and dynamic environments. However, existing
video-based ReID methods often overlook the necessity of identifying and
selecting the most discriminative features from both videos in a query-gallery
pair for effective matching. To address this issue, we propose a novel
Hierarchical and Adaptive Mixture of Biometric Experts (HAMoBE) framework,
which leverages multi-layer features from a pre-trained large model (e.g.,
CLIP) and is designed to mimic human perceptual mechanisms by independently
modeling key biometric features--appearance, static body shape, and dynamic
gait--and adaptively integrating them. Specifically, HAMoBE includes two
levels: the first level extracts low-level features from multi-layer
representations provided by the frozen large model, while the second level
consists of specialized experts focusing on long-term, short-term, and temporal
features. To ensure robust matching, we introduce a new dual-input decision
gating network that dynamically adjusts the contributions of each expert based
on their relevance to the input scenarios. Extensive evaluations on benchmarks
like MEVID demonstrate that our approach yields significant performance
improvements (e.g., +13.0% Rank-1 accuracy).

TL;DR: 论文提出了NiM基准和Spot-IT方法，用于评估和改进多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在复杂文档中定位和推理细粒度细节的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLMs在文档理解任务中表现出色，但在处理复杂文档中的细粒度细节（如菜单中的营养成分或文章中的免责声明）时能力不足，需要更深入的研究。

Method: 引入NiM基准，涵盖多种真实文档；提出Spot-IT方法，通过智能补丁选择和高斯注意力增强MLLMs能力。

Result: 实验表明当前MLLMs在细粒度任务中存在局限性，而Spot-IT在复杂布局中的细节提取上显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: Spot-IT有效提升了MLLMs在细粒度文档理解任务中的表现，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: While Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown impressive
capabilities in document understanding tasks, their ability to locate and
reason about fine-grained details within complex documents remains
understudied. Consider searching a restaurant menu for a specific nutritional
detail or identifying a disclaimer in a lengthy newspaper article tasks that
demand careful attention to small but significant details within a broader
narrative, akin to Finding Needles in Images (NiM). To address this gap, we
introduce NiM, a carefully curated benchmark spanning diverse real-world
documents including newspapers, menus, and lecture images, specifically
designed to evaluate MLLMs' capability in these intricate tasks. Building on
this, we further propose Spot-IT, a simple yet effective approach that enhances
MLLMs capability through intelligent patch selection and Gaussian attention,
motivated from how humans zoom and focus when searching documents. Our
extensive experiments reveal both the capabilities and limitations of current
MLLMs in handling fine-grained document understanding tasks, while
demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach. Spot-IT achieves significant
improvements over baseline methods, particularly in scenarios requiring precise
detail extraction from complex layouts.

TL;DR: DualMat是一种双路径扩散框架，用于在复杂光照条件下从单张图像估计基于物理的渲染（PBR）材质。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在估计PBR材质时难以处理复杂光照条件，且效率较低。

Method: 采用双路径设计：一条路径优化反照率（RGB潜在空间），另一条路径专注于金属和粗糙度估计（紧凑潜在空间），并通过特征蒸馏和整流流技术提升效率和一致性。

Result: 在Objaverse和真实数据上表现优异，反照率估计提升28%，金属-粗糙度预测误差减少39%。

Conclusion: DualMat在PBR材质估计中实现了最先进的性能，适用于高分辨率和多视角输入。

Abstract: We present DualMat, a novel dual-path diffusion framework for estimating
Physically Based Rendering (PBR) materials from single images under complex
lighting conditions. Our approach operates in two distinct latent spaces: an
albedo-optimized path leveraging pretrained visual knowledge through RGB latent
space, and a material-specialized path operating in a compact latent space
designed for precise metallic and roughness estimation. To ensure coherent
predictions between the albedo-optimized and material-specialized paths, we
introduce feature distillation during training. We employ rectified flow to
enhance efficiency by reducing inference steps while maintaining quality. Our
framework extends to high-resolution and multi-view inputs through patch-based
estimation and cross-view attention, enabling seamless integration into
image-to-3D pipelines. DualMat achieves state-of-the-art performance on both
Objaverse and real-world data, significantly outperforming existing methods
with up to 28% improvement in albedo estimation and 39% reduction in
metallic-roughness prediction errors.

TL;DR: DecoupleCSS提出了一种两阶段框架，通过解耦类感知检测和类无关分割，解决了持续语义分割中的灾难性遗忘问题，实现了更好的保留与适应平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有持续语义分割方法通常采用单阶段编码器-解码器架构，导致新旧类别学习干扰和保留-可塑性平衡不佳。

Method: DecoupleCSS采用两阶段框架：第一阶段使用预训练文本和图像编码器生成位置感知提示；第二阶段利用Segment Anything Model（SAM）生成精确分割掩码。

Result: 该方法在多种挑战性任务中实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: DecoupleCSS通过解耦设计有效解决了持续语义分割中的灾难性遗忘问题，提升了性能。

Abstract: Continual Semantic Segmentation (CSS) requires learning new classes without
forgetting previously acquired knowledge, addressing the fundamental challenge
of catastrophic forgetting in dense prediction tasks. However, existing CSS
methods typically employ single-stage encoder-decoder architectures where
segmentation masks and class labels are tightly coupled, leading to
interference between old and new class learning and suboptimal
retention-plasticity balance. We introduce DecoupleCSS, a novel two-stage
framework for CSS. By decoupling class-aware detection from class-agnostic
segmentation, DecoupleCSS enables more effective continual learning, preserving
past knowledge while learning new classes. The first stage leverages
pre-trained text and image encoders, adapted using LoRA, to encode
class-specific information and generate location-aware prompts. In the second
stage, the Segment Anything Model (SAM) is employed to produce precise
segmentation masks, ensuring that segmentation knowledge is shared across both
new and previous classes. This approach improves the balance between retention
and adaptability in CSS, achieving state-of-the-art performance across a
variety of challenging tasks. Our code is publicly available at:

Motivation: 图像着色任务因其在颜色恢复和自动动画着色等应用中的重要性而备受关注，但由于其高度不适定性，需要利用场景语义和纹理线索。

Conclusion: 通过分类和对抗学习探索图像着色，为未来研究提供方向。

Abstract: Image colorization, the task of adding colors to grayscale images, has been
the focus of significant research efforts in computer vision in recent years
for its various application areas such as color restoration and automatic
animation colorization [15, 1]. The colorization problem is challenging as it
is highly ill-posed with two out of three image dimensions lost, resulting in
large degrees of freedom. However, semantics of the scene as well as the
surface texture could provide important cues for colors: the sky is typically
blue, the clouds are typically white and the grass is typically green, and
there are huge amounts of training data available for learning such priors
since any colored image could serve as a training data point [20].
  Colorization is initially formulated as a regression task[5], which ignores
the multi-modal nature of color prediction. In this project, we explore
automatic image colorization via classification and adversarial learning. We
will build our models on prior works, apply modifications for our specific
scenario and make comparisons.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GAN和扩散方法依赖额外控制模块或算法，可能引入误差，导致效果不佳。

Method: 基于FLUX-Kontext框架，引入RefLoRAInjector轻量级特征注入器，并设计高效数据生成流程。

Result: 实验表明FLUX-Makeup在多样场景下表现最优，且数据集质量显著提升。

Conclusion: FLUX-Makeup无需辅助组件即可实现高保真、身份一致的化妆迁移，性能领先。

Abstract: Makeup transfer aims to apply the makeup style from a reference face to a
target face and has been increasingly adopted in practical applications.
Existing GAN-based approaches typically rely on carefully designed loss
functions to balance transfer quality and facial identity consistency, while
diffusion-based methods often depend on additional face-control modules or
algorithms to preserve identity. However, these auxiliary components tend to
introduce extra errors, leading to suboptimal transfer results. To overcome
these limitations, we propose FLUX-Makeup, a high-fidelity,
identity-consistent, and robust makeup transfer framework that eliminates the
need for any auxiliary face-control components. Instead, our method directly
leverages source-reference image pairs to achieve superior transfer
performance. Specifically, we build our framework upon FLUX-Kontext, using the
source image as its native conditional input. Furthermore, we introduce
RefLoRAInjector, a lightweight makeup feature injector that decouples the
reference pathway from the backbone, enabling efficient and comprehensive
extraction of makeup-related information. In parallel, we design a robust and
scalable data generation pipeline to provide more accurate supervision during
training. The paired makeup datasets produced by this pipeline significantly
surpass the quality of all existing datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that FLUX-Makeup achieves state-of-the-art performance, exhibiting strong
robustness across diverse scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PFMs在自监督预训练中表现出强大的表征能力，但其预训练背景的多样性和不透明性导致潜在偏差，影响下游应用的泛化性和透明度。

Method: AdaFusion通过压缩和对齐来自不同模型的瓦片级特征，利用轻量级注意力机制根据组织表型动态融合特征。

Result: 在三个真实世界基准测试中，AdaFusion在分类和回归任务上均优于单个PFMs，并提供模型生物语义特化的可解释性洞察。

Conclusion: AdaFusion能够桥接异构PFMs，显著提升性能并增强模型特定归纳偏差的可解释性。

Abstract: Pathology foundation models (PFMs) have demonstrated strong representational
capabilities through self-supervised pre-training on large-scale, unannotated
histopathology image datasets. However, their diverse yet opaque pretraining
contexts, shaped by both data-related and structural/training factors,
introduce latent biases that hinder generalisability and transparency in
downstream applications. In this paper, we propose AdaFusion, a novel
prompt-guided inference framework that, to our knowledge, is among the very
first to dynamically integrate complementary knowledge from multiple PFMs. Our
method compresses and aligns tile-level features from diverse models and
employs a lightweight attention mechanism to adaptively fuse them based on
tissue phenotype context. We evaluate AdaFusion on three real-world benchmarks
spanning treatment response prediction, tumour grading, and spatial gene
expression inference. Our approach consistently surpasses individual PFMs
across both classification and regression tasks, while offering interpretable
insights into each model's biosemantic specialisation. These results highlight
AdaFusion's ability to bridge heterogeneous PFMs, achieving both enhanced
performance and interpretability of model-specific inductive biases.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前扩散模型在生成长视频时存在身份漂移和短时长限制，PoseGen旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 采用上下文LoRA微调策略，在令牌级别注入主题外观以保持身份，同时在通道级别条件化姿态信息以控制运动。通过分段生成和共享KV缓存机制实现无缝拼接。

Result: 在33小时的小数据集上训练，PoseGen在身份保真度、姿态准确性和长视频生成能力上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: PoseGen能够生成无限制时长、无伪影且连贯的视频，具有显著优势。

Abstract: Generating long, temporally coherent videos with precise control over subject
identity and motion is a formidable challenge for current diffusion models,
which often suffer from identity drift and are limited to short clips. We
introduce PoseGen, a novel framework that generates arbitrarily long videos of
a specific subject from a single reference image and a driving pose sequence.
Our core innovation is an in-context LoRA finetuning strategy that injects
subject appearance at the token level for identity preservation, while
simultaneously conditioning on pose information at the channel level for
fine-grained motion control. To overcome duration limits, PoseGen pioneers an
interleaved segment generation method that seamlessly stitches video clips
together, using a shared KV cache mechanism and a specialized transition
process to ensure background consistency and temporal smoothness. Trained on a
remarkably small 33-hour video dataset, extensive experiments show that PoseGen
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in identity fidelity, pose
accuracy, and its unique ability to produce coherent, artifact-free videos of
unlimited duration.

TL;DR: SMP（Sculpting Margin Penalty）是一种新颖的FSCIL方法，通过在不同阶段策略性地整合边距惩罚，解决了基类判别性和新类泛化性的平衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实应用中数据隐私和获取成本限制了增量任务的训练数据，导致类增量学习性能下降。现有方法难以平衡基类判别性和新类泛化性，且增量任务中原始数据有限导致决策边界模糊。

Method: SMP引入Margin-aware Intra-task Adapter Merging（MIAM）机制，训练两组低秩适配器，分别增强基类判别性和新类泛化性，并自适应合并。增量任务中采用Margin Penalty-based Classifier Calibration（MPCC）策略优化决策边界。

Result: 在CIFAR100、ImageNet-R和CUB200上的实验表明，SMP在FSCIL中实现了最先进的性能，同时更好地平衡了基类和新类。

Conclusion: SMP通过策略性整合边距惩罚，有效解决了FSCIL中的基类判别性和新类泛化性问题，提升了性能。

Abstract: Real-world applications often face data privacy constraints and high
acquisition costs, making the assumption of sufficient training data in
incremental tasks unrealistic and leading to significant performance
degradation in class-incremental learning. Forward-compatible learning, which
prospectively prepares for future tasks during base task training, has emerged
as a promising solution for Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning (FSCIL).
However, existing methods still struggle to balance base-class discriminability
and new-class generalization. Moreover, limited access to original data during
incremental tasks often results in ambiguous inter-class decision boundaries.
To address these challenges, we propose SMP (Sculpting Margin Penalty), a novel
FSCIL method that strategically integrates margin penalties at different stages
within the parameter-efficient fine-tuning paradigm. Specifically, we introduce
the Margin-aware Intra-task Adapter Merging (MIAM) mechanism for base task
learning. MIAM trains two sets of low-rank adapters with distinct
classification losses: one with a margin penalty to enhance base-class
discriminability, and the other without margin constraints to promote
generalization to future new classes. These adapters are then adaptively merged
to improve forward compatibility. For incremental tasks, we propose a Margin
Penalty-based Classifier Calibration (MPCC) strategy to refine decision
boundaries by fine-tuning classifiers on all seen classes' embeddings with a
margin penalty. Extensive experiments on CIFAR100, ImageNet-R, and CUB200
demonstrate that SMP achieves state-of-the-art performance in FSCIL while
maintaining a better balance between base and new classes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多实例学习在病理图像分类中因处理大量高分辨率图像块导致的高推理成本问题。

Method: 提出AHDMIL框架，结合DMIN和DB-LIPN网络，通过自蒸馏和不对称蒸馏筛选相关图像块，并引入CKA分类器提升性能。

Result: 在四个公开数据集上，AHDMIL在分类性能和推理速度上均优于现有方法，例如在Camelyon16上准确率提升5.3%，推理速度提高1.2倍。

Conclusion: AHDMIL通过高效筛选和分类策略，显著提升了病理图像分类的效率和准确性。

Abstract: Although multi-instance learning (MIL) has succeeded in pathological image
classification, it faces the challenge of high inference costs due to the need
to process thousands of patches from each gigapixel whole slide image (WSI). To
address this, we propose AHDMIL, an Asymmetric Hierarchical Distillation
Multi-Instance Learning framework that enables fast and accurate classification
by eliminating irrelevant patches through a two-step training process. AHDMIL
comprises two key components: the Dynamic Multi-Instance Network (DMIN), which
operates on high-resolution WSIs, and the Dual-Branch Lightweight Instance
Pre-screening Network (DB-LIPN), which analyzes corresponding low-resolution
counterparts. In the first step, self-distillation (SD), DMIN is trained for
WSI classification while generating per-instance attention scores to identify
irrelevant patches. These scores guide the second step, asymmetric distillation
(AD), where DB-LIPN learns to predict the relevance of each low-resolution
patch. The relevant patches predicted by DB-LIPN have spatial correspondence
with patches in high-resolution WSIs, which are used for fine-tuning and
efficient inference of DMIN. In addition, we design the first
Chebyshev-polynomial-based Kolmogorov-Arnold (CKA) classifier in computational
pathology, which improves classification performance through learnable
activation layers. Extensive experiments on four public datasets demonstrate
that AHDMIL consistently outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods in both
classification performance and inference speed. For example, on the Camelyon16
dataset, it achieves a relative improvement of 5.3% in accuracy and accelerates
inference by 1.2.times. Across all datasets, area under the curve (AUC),
accuracy, f1 score, and brier score show consistent gains, with average
inference speedups ranging from 1.2 to 2.1 times. The code is available.

Result: 在多个基准测试中优于现有RIS和REC方法，并在GRES基准上表现优异。

Conclusion: 通过多潜在表达和对比学习，显著提升了视觉定位任务的性能。

Abstract: Visual grounding tasks, such as referring image segmentation (RIS) and
referring expression comprehension (REC), aim to localize a target object based
on a given textual description. The target object in an image can be described
in multiple ways, reflecting diverse attributes such as color, position, and
more. However, most existing methods rely on a single textual input, which
captures only a fraction of the rich information available in the visual
domain. This mismatch between rich visual details and sparse textual cues can
lead to the misidentification of similar objects. To address this, we propose a
novel visual grounding framework that leverages multiple latent expressions
generated from a single textual input by incorporating complementary visual
details absent from the original description. Specifically, we introduce
subject distributor and visual concept injector modules to embed both
shared-subject and distinct-attributes concepts into the latent
representations, thereby capturing unique and target-specific visual cues. We
also propose a positive-margin contrastive learning strategy to align all
latent expressions with the original text while preserving subtle variations.
Experimental results show that our method not only outperforms state-of-the-art
RIS and REC approaches on multiple benchmarks but also achieves outstanding
performance on the generalized referring expression segmentation (GRES)
benchmark.

Conclusion: FedGIN在多模态医学图像分割中表现优异，具有强泛化能力，适用于隐私受限场景。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation plays a crucial role in AI-assisted diagnostics,
surgical planning, and treatment monitoring. Accurate and robust segmentation
models are essential for enabling reliable, data-driven clinical decision
making across diverse imaging modalities. Given the inherent variability in
image characteristics across modalities, developing a unified model capable of
generalizing effectively to multiple modalities would be highly beneficial.
This model could streamline clinical workflows and reduce the need for
modality-specific training. However, real-world deployment faces major
challenges, including data scarcity, domain shift between modalities (e.g., CT
vs. MRI), and privacy restrictions that prevent data sharing. To address these
issues, we propose FedGIN, a Federated Learning (FL) framework that enables
multimodal organ segmentation without sharing raw patient data. Our method
integrates a lightweight Global Intensity Non-linear (GIN) augmentation module
that harmonizes modality-specific intensity distributions during local
training. We evaluated FedGIN using two types of datasets: an imputed dataset
and a complete dataset. In the limited dataset scenario, the model was
initially trained using only MRI data, and CT data was added to assess its
performance improvements. In the complete dataset scenario, both MRI and CT
data were fully utilized for training on all clients. In the limited-data
scenario, FedGIN achieved a 12 to 18% improvement in 3D Dice scores on MRI test
cases compared to FL without GIN and consistently outperformed local baselines.
In the complete dataset scenario, FedGIN demonstrated near-centralized
performance, with a 30% Dice score improvement over the MRI-only baseline and a
10% improvement over the CT-only baseline, highlighting its strong
cross-modality generalization under privacy constraints.

Abstract: Assessing chronic pain behavior in mice is critical for preclinical studies.
However, existing methods mostly rely on manual labeling of behavioral
features, and humans lack a clear understanding of which behaviors best
represent chronic pain. For this reason, existing methods struggle to
accurately capture the insidious and persistent behavioral changes in chronic
pain. This study proposes a framework to automatically discover features
related to chronic pain without relying on human-defined action labels. Our
method uses universal action space projector to automatically extract mouse
action features, and avoids the potential bias of human labeling by retaining
the rich behavioral information in the original video. In this paper, we also
collected a mouse pain behavior dataset that captures the disease progression
of both neuropathic and inflammatory pain across multiple time points. Our
method achieves 48.41\% accuracy in a 15-class pain classification task,
significantly outperforming human experts (21.33\%) and the widely used method
B-SOiD (30.52\%). Furthermore, when the classification is simplified to only
three categories, i.e., neuropathic pain, inflammatory pain, and no pain, then
our method achieves an accuracy of 73.1\%, which is notably higher than that of
human experts (48\%) and B-SOiD (58.43\%). Finally, our method revealed
differences in drug efficacy for different types of pain on zero-shot
Gabapentin drug testing, and the results were consistent with past drug
efficacy literature. This study demonstrates the potential clinical application
of our method, which can provide new insights into pain research and related
drug development.

Result: 实验证明该方法在模拟和真实数据集上表现优越，并能以即插即用的方式提升现有ASISR方法的性能。

Conclusion: 提出的旋转等变ASISR方法有效解决了几何模式变形问题，为图像超分辨率领域提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: The arbitrary-scale image super-resolution (ASISR), a recent popular topic in
computer vision, aims to achieve arbitrary-scale high-resolution recoveries
from a low-resolution input image. This task is realized by representing the
image as a continuous implicit function through two fundamental modules, a
deep-network-based encoder and an implicit neural representation (INR) module.
Despite achieving notable progress, a crucial challenge of such a highly
ill-posed setting is that many common geometric patterns, such as repetitive
textures, edges, or shapes, are seriously warped and deformed in the
low-resolution images, naturally leading to unexpected artifacts appearing in
their high-resolution recoveries. Embedding rotation equivariance into the
ASISR network is thus necessary, as it has been widely demonstrated that this
enhancement enables the recovery to faithfully maintain the original
orientations and structural integrity of geometric patterns underlying the
input image. Motivated by this, we make efforts to construct a rotation
equivariant ASISR method in this study. Specifically, we elaborately redesign
the basic architectures of INR and encoder modules, incorporating intrinsic
rotation equivariance capabilities beyond those of conventional ASISR networks.
Through such amelioration, the ASISR network can, for the first time, be
implemented with end-to-end rotational equivariance maintained from input to
output. We also provide a solid theoretical analysis to evaluate its intrinsic
equivariance error, demonstrating its inherent nature of embedding such an
equivariance structure. The superiority of the proposed method is substantiated
by experiments conducted on both simulated and real datasets. We also validate
that the proposed framework can be readily integrated into current ASISR
methods in a plug \& play manner to further enhance their performance.

Conclusion: X-MoGen通过统一框架和形态一致性模块，成功实现了跨物种文本驱动运动生成，并在实验中验证了其优越性。

Abstract: Text-driven motion generation has attracted increasing attention due to its
broad applications in virtual reality, animation, and robotics. While existing
methods typically model human and animal motion separately, a joint
cross-species approach offers key advantages, such as a unified representation
and improved generalization. However, morphological differences across species
remain a key challenge, often compromising motion plausibility. To address
this, we propose \textbf{X-MoGen}, the first unified framework for
cross-species text-driven motion generation covering both humans and animals.
X-MoGen adopts a two-stage architecture. First, a conditional graph variational
autoencoder learns canonical T-pose priors, while an autoencoder encodes motion
into a shared latent space regularized by morphological loss. In the second
stage, we perform masked motion modeling to generate motion embeddings
conditioned on textual descriptions. During training, a morphological
consistency module is employed to promote skeletal plausibility across species.
To support unified modeling, we construct \textbf{UniMo4D}, a large-scale
dataset of 115 species and 119k motion sequences, which integrates human and
animal motions under a shared skeletal topology for joint training. Extensive
experiments on UniMo4D demonstrate that X-MoGen outperforms state-of-the-art
methods on both seen and unseen species.

TL;DR: PhysPatch是一种针对多模态大语言模型（MLLM）的自动驾驶系统的物理可实现对抗补丁框架，优化补丁位置、形状和内容，显著提升攻击效果和实际应用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对抗补丁方法主要针对目标检测模型，在MLLM系统中表现不佳，因此需要一种针对MLLM复杂架构和推理能力的攻击方法。

Method: PhysPatch通过联合优化补丁位置、形状和内容，引入语义掩码初始化、SVD局部对齐损失和势场掩码细化方法。

Conclusion: PhysPatch在物理可行区域放置对抗补丁，确保实际应用性和部署性，为MLLM系统的安全性提供新视角。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are becoming integral to autonomous
driving (AD) systems due to their strong vision-language reasoning
capabilities. However, MLLMs are vulnerable to adversarial attacks,
particularly adversarial patch attacks, which can pose serious threats in
real-world scenarios. Existing patch-based attack methods are primarily
designed for object detection models and perform poorly when transferred to
MLLM-based systems due to the latter's complex architectures and reasoning
abilities. To address these limitations, we propose PhysPatch, a physically
realizable and transferable adversarial patch framework tailored for MLLM-based
AD systems. PhysPatch jointly optimizes patch location, shape, and content to
enhance attack effectiveness and real-world applicability. It introduces a
semantic-based mask initialization strategy for realistic placement, an
SVD-based local alignment loss with patch-guided crop-resize to improve
transferability, and a potential field-based mask refinement method. Extensive
experiments across open-source, commercial, and reasoning-capable MLLMs
demonstrate that PhysPatch significantly outperforms prior methods in steering
MLLM-based AD systems toward target-aligned perception and planning outputs.
Moreover, PhysPatch consistently places adversarial patches in physically
feasible regions of AD scenes, ensuring strong real-world applicability and
deployability.

Motivation: 现有方法在面对未见类别目标时，因低置信度检测、弱运动与外观约束以及长期遮挡等问题表现不佳。

Conclusion: MTT方法有效解决了未见类别目标的跟踪问题，提升了长期关联的准确性。

Abstract: Tracking specific targets, such as pedestrians and vehicles, has been the
focus of recent vision-based multitarget tracking studies. However, in some
real-world scenarios, unseen categories often challenge existing methods due to
low-confidence detections, weak motion and appearance constraints, and
long-term occlusions. To address these issues, this article proposes a
tracklet-enhanced tracker called Multi-Tracklet Tracking (MTT) that integrates
flexible tracklet generation into a multi-tracklet association framework. This
framework first adaptively clusters the detection results according to their
short-term spatio-temporal correlation into robust tracklets and then estimates
the best tracklet partitions using multiple clues, such as location and
appearance over time to mitigate error propagation in long-term association.
Finally, extensive experiments on the benchmark for generic multiple object
tracking demonstrate the competitiveness of the proposed framework.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在低资源语言中效果不佳，主要依赖文本模态或机器翻译，忽视了多模态信息和文化基础的重要性。

Method: 提出双源策略，分别收集文化相关的原生网页替代文本和语言相关的MLLM生成标题，构建MELLA数据集。

Result: 实验表明，MELLA微调后，八种语言的MLLM性能普遍提升，生成更丰富的描述。

Conclusion: 研究验证了文化知识和语言能力的双重提升，MELLA数据集为低资源语言MLLM提供了有效支持。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown remarkable performance in
high-resource languages. However, their effectiveness diminishes significantly
in the contexts of low-resource languages. Current multilingual enhancement
methods are often limited to text modality or rely solely on machine
translation. While such approaches help models acquire basic linguistic
capabilities and produce "thin descriptions", they neglect the importance of
multimodal informativeness and cultural groundedness, both of which are crucial
for serving low-resource language users effectively. To bridge this gap, in
this study, we identify two significant objectives for a truly effective MLLM
in low-resource language settings, namely 1) linguistic capability and 2)
cultural groundedness, placing special emphasis on cultural awareness. To
achieve these dual objectives, we propose a dual-source strategy that guides
the collection of data tailored to each goal, sourcing native web alt-text for
culture and MLLM-generated captions for linguistics. As a concrete
implementation, we introduce MELLA, a multimodal, multilingual dataset.
Experiment results show that after fine-tuning on MELLA, there is a general
performance improvement for the eight languages on various MLLM backbones, with
models producing "thick descriptions". We verify that the performance gains are
from both cultural knowledge enhancement and linguistic capability enhancement.

Motivation: 解决域适应中忽略域内结构导致判别性下降的问题。

Method: 1. 粗粒度图对齐与谱正则化；2. 细粒度邻居感知传播；3. 数据增强与一致性正则化。

Result: 在基准数据集上表现优于现有方法，具有强鲁棒性和适应性。

Conclusion: SPA++通过谱对齐和一致性正则化，显著提升了域适应性能。

Abstract: Domain Adaptation (DA) aims to transfer knowledge from a labeled source
domain to an unlabeled or sparsely labeled target domain under domain shifts.
Most prior works focus on capturing the inter-domain transferability but
largely overlook rich intra-domain structures, which empirically results in
even worse discriminability. To tackle this tradeoff, we propose a generalized
graph SPectral Alignment framework, SPA++. Its core is briefly condensed as
follows: (1)-by casting the DA problem to graph primitives, it composes a
coarse graph alignment mechanism with a novel spectral regularizer toward
aligning the domain graphs in eigenspaces; (2)-we further develop a
fine-grained neighbor-aware propagation mechanism for enhanced discriminability
in the target domain; (3)-by incorporating data augmentation and consistency
regularization, SPA++ can adapt to complex scenarios including most DA settings
and even challenging distribution scenarios. Furthermore, we also provide
theoretical analysis to support our method, including the generalization bound
of graph-based DA and the role of spectral alignment and smoothing consistency.
Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that SPA++ consistently
outperforms existing cutting-edge methods, achieving superior robustness and
adaptability across various challenging adaptation scenarios.

TL;DR: Uni-CoT是一个统一的链式思维框架，通过两级推理范式（宏观和微观）和结构化训练，实现了高效的多模态推理，并在多个基准测试中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法在视觉语言推理任务中建模视觉状态转换能力不足或架构碎片化导致的不连贯问题。

Method: 提出Uni-CoT框架，采用两级推理范式（宏观任务规划和微观子任务执行）和结构化训练方法。

Result: 在WISE、RISE和KRIS基准测试中表现出SOTA性能和强泛化能力。

Conclusion: Uni-CoT为多模态推理提供了一种高效且连贯的解决方案。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning has been widely adopted to enhance Large
Language Models (LLMs) by decomposing complex tasks into simpler, sequential
subtasks. However, extending CoT to vision-language reasoning tasks remains
challenging, as it often requires interpreting transitions of visual states to
support reasoning. Existing methods often struggle with this due to limited
capacity of modeling visual state transitions or incoherent visual trajectories
caused by fragmented architectures.
  To overcome these limitations, we propose Uni-CoT, a Unified Chain-of-Thought
framework that enables coherent and grounded multimodal reasoning within a
single unified model. The key idea is to leverage a model capable of both image
understanding and generation to reason over visual content and model evolving
visual states. However, empowering a unified model to achieve that is
non-trivial, given the high computational cost and the burden of training. To
address this, Uni-CoT introduces a novel two-level reasoning paradigm: A
Macro-Level CoT for high-level task planning and A Micro-Level CoT for subtask
execution. This design significantly reduces the computational overhead.
Furthermore, we introduce a structured training paradigm that combines
interleaved image-text supervision for macro-level CoT with multi-task
objectives for micro-level CoT. Together, these innovations allow Uni-CoT to
perform scalable and coherent multi-modal reasoning. Furthermore, thanks to our
design, all experiments can be efficiently completed using only 8 A100 GPUs
with 80GB VRAM each. Experimental results on reasoning-driven image generation
benchmark (WISE) and editing benchmarks (RISE and KRIS) indicates that Uni-CoT
demonstrates SOTA performance and strong generalization, establishing Uni-CoT
as a promising solution for multi-modal reasoning. Project Page and Code:

Motivation: 光谱信息在遥感观测中至关重要，但现有视觉语言模型未能充分利用光谱信息，导致性能不佳。

Method: 构建SPIE数据集，将光谱先验编码为文本属性；提出SPEX模型，采用多尺度特征聚合、标记上下文压缩和多光谱视觉预训练等策略。

Conclusion: SPEX是首个专注于光谱遥感图像土地覆盖提取的多模态模型，性能优越且具有解释性。

Abstract: Spectral information has long been recognized as a critical cue in remote
sensing observations. Although numerous vision-language models have been
developed for pixel-level interpretation, spectral information remains
underutilized, resulting in suboptimal performance, particularly in
multispectral scenarios. To address this limitation, we construct a
vision-language instruction-following dataset named SPIE, which encodes
spectral priors of land-cover objects into textual attributes recognizable by
large language models (LLMs), based on classical spectral index computations.
Leveraging this dataset, we propose SPEX, a multimodal LLM designed for
instruction-driven land cover extraction. To this end, we introduce several
carefully designed components and training strategies, including multiscale
feature aggregation, token context condensation, and multispectral visual
pre-training, to achieve precise and flexible pixel-level interpretation. To
the best of our knowledge, SPEX is the first multimodal vision-language model
dedicated to land cover extraction in spectral remote sensing imagery.
Extensive experiments on five public multispectral datasets demonstrate that
SPEX consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in extracting
typical land cover categories such as vegetation, buildings, and water bodies.
Moreover, SPEX is capable of generating textual explanations for its
predictions, thereby enhancing interpretability and user-friendliness. Code

Motivation: 现有GUI定位方法依赖高成本标注数据，而模型预测的空间重叠模式隐含置信信号，可用于更准确定位。

Method: GUI-RC通过空间投票网格识别共识区域；GUI-RCPO将一致性模式转化为奖励，用于推理时的自监督优化。

Conclusion: 该方法展示了测试时扩展和强化学习在GUI定位中的潜力，为更鲁棒、高效的数据驱动GUI代理提供了新思路。

Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) grounding, the task of mapping natural
language instructions to precise screen coordinates, is fundamental to
autonomous GUI agents. While existing methods achieve strong performance
through extensive supervised training or reinforcement learning with labeled
rewards, they remain constrained by the cost and availability of pixel-level
annotations. We observe that when models generate multiple predictions for the
same GUI element, the spatial overlap patterns reveal implicit confidence
signals that can guide more accurate localization. Leveraging this insight, we
propose GUI-RC (Region Consistency), a test-time scaling method that constructs
spatial voting grids from multiple sampled predictions to identify consensus
regions where models show highest agreement. Without any training, GUI-RC
improves accuracy by 2-3% across various architectures on ScreenSpot
benchmarks. We further introduce GUI-RCPO (Region Consistency Policy
Optimization), which transforms these consistency patterns into rewards for
test-time reinforcement learning. By computing how well each prediction aligns
with the collective consensus, GUI-RCPO enables models to iteratively refine
their outputs on unlabeled data during inference. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the generality of our approach: GUI-RC boosts
Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct from 80.11% to 83.57% on ScreenSpot-v2, while GUI-RCPO
further improves it to 85.14% through self-supervised optimization. Our
approach reveals the untapped potential of test-time scaling and test-time
reinforcement learning for GUI grounding, offering a promising path toward more
robust and data-efficient GUI agents.

TL;DR: EndoMatcher提出了一种通用的内窥镜图像匹配方法，通过大规模多域数据预训练解决视觉条件困难和数据稀缺问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 内窥镜图像中的密集特征匹配对机器人辅助任务至关重要，但由于视觉条件复杂（如弱纹理、大视角变化）和标注数据稀缺，仍具挑战性。

Method: EndoMatcher采用双分支Vision Transformer提取多尺度特征，并通过双交互块增强对应学习；构建Endo-Mix6多域数据集，采用渐进多目标训练策略。

Result: 在零样本匹配实验中，EndoMatcher在Hamlyn和Bladder数据集上分别增加140.69%和201.43%的内点匹配，并在Gastro-Matching数据集上提高MDPA 9.40%。

Conclusion: EndoMatcher在复杂内窥镜条件下实现了密集且准确的匹配，具有显著的泛化能力。

Abstract: Generalizable dense feature matching in endoscopic images is crucial for
robot-assisted tasks, including 3D reconstruction, navigation, and surgical
scene understanding. Yet, it remains a challenge due to difficult visual
conditions (e.g., weak textures, large viewpoint variations) and a scarcity of
annotated data. To address these challenges, we propose EndoMatcher, a
generalizable endoscopic image matcher via large-scale, multi-domain data
pre-training. To address difficult visual conditions, EndoMatcher employs a
two-branch Vision Transformer to extract multi-scale features, enhanced by dual
interaction blocks for robust correspondence learning. To overcome data
scarcity and improve domain diversity, we construct Endo-Mix6, the first
multi-domain dataset for endoscopic matching. Endo-Mix6 consists of
approximately 1.2M real and synthetic image pairs across six domains, with
correspondence labels generated using Structure-from-Motion and simulated
transformations. The diversity and scale of Endo-Mix6 introduce new challenges
in training stability due to significant variations in dataset sizes,
distribution shifts, and error imbalance. To address them, a progressive
multi-objective training strategy is employed to promote balanced learning and
improve representation quality across domains. This enables EndoMatcher to
generalize across unseen organs and imaging conditions in a zero-shot fashion.
Extensive zero-shot matching experiments demonstrate that EndoMatcher increases
the number of inlier matches by 140.69% and 201.43% on the Hamlyn and Bladder
datasets over state-of-the-art methods, respectively, and improves the Matching
Direction Prediction Accuracy (MDPA) by 9.40% on the Gastro-Matching dataset,
achieving dense and accurate matching under challenging endoscopic conditions.

Motivation: 大型多模态模型（LMMs）在视觉-语言任务中表现优异，但视觉令牌冗余导致高计算成本，现有修剪方法简单且性能下降严重。

Method: 提出VFlowOpt框架，结合重要性映射、渐进式修剪和回收机制，并通过视觉信息流优化修剪策略。

Result: 实验显示VFlowOpt可修剪90%的视觉令牌，性能相近，减少89%的KV-Cache内存，推理速度提升3.8倍。

Conclusion: VFlowOpt有效平衡了计算成本与性能，为LMMs提供了高效的令牌修剪解决方案。

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) excel in visual-language tasks by leveraging
numerous visual tokens for fine-grained visual information, but this token
redundancy results in significant computational costs. Previous research aimed
at reducing visual tokens during inference typically leverages importance maps
derived from attention scores among vision-only tokens or vision-language
tokens to prune tokens across one or multiple pruning stages. Despite this
progress, pruning frameworks and strategies remain simplistic and
insufficiently explored, often resulting in substantial performance
degradation. In this paper, we propose VFlowOpt, a token pruning framework that
introduces an importance map derivation process and a progressive pruning
module with a recycling mechanism. The hyperparameters of its pruning strategy
are further optimized by a visual information flow-guided method. Specifically,
we compute an importance map for image tokens based on their attention-derived
context relevance and patch-level information entropy. We then decide which
tokens to retain or prune and aggregate the pruned ones as recycled tokens to
avoid potential information loss. Finally, we apply a visual information
flow-guided method that regards the last token in the LMM as the most
representative signal of text-visual interactions. This method minimizes the
discrepancy between token representations in LMMs with and without pruning,
thereby enabling superior pruning strategies tailored to different LMMs.
Experiments demonstrate that VFlowOpt can prune 90% of visual tokens while
maintaining comparable performance, leading to an 89% reduction in KV-Cache
memory and 3.8 times faster inference.

Abstract: Few-Shot Segmentation(FSS) aims to efficient segmentation of new objects with
few labeled samples. However, its performance significantly degrades when
domain discrepancies exist between training and deployment. Cross-Domain
Few-Shot Segmentation(CD-FSS) is proposed to mitigate such performance
degradation. Current CD-FSS methods primarily sought to develop segmentation
models on a source domain capable of cross-domain generalization. However,
driven by escalating concerns over data privacy and the imperative to minimize
data transfer and training expenses, the development of source-free CD-FSS
approaches has become essential. In this work, we propose a source-free CD-FSS
method that leverages both textual and visual information to facilitate target
domain task adaptation without requiring source domain data. Specifically, we
first append Task-Specific Attention Adapters (TSAA) to the feature pyramid of
a pretrained backbone, which adapt multi-level features extracted from the
shared pre-trained backbone to the target task. Then, the parameters of the
TSAA are trained through a Visual-Visual Embedding Alignment (VVEA) module and
a Text-Visual Embedding Alignment (TVEA) module. The VVEA module utilizes
global-local visual features to align image features across different views,
while the TVEA module leverages textual priors from pre-aligned multi-modal
features (e.g., from CLIP) to guide cross-modal adaptation. By combining the
outputs of these modules through dense comparison operations and subsequent
fusion via skip connections, our method produces refined prediction masks.
Under both 1-shot and 5-shot settings, the proposed approach achieves average
segmentation accuracy improvements of 2.18\% and 4.11\%, respectively, across
four cross-domain datasets, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art CD-FSS
methods. Code are available at https://github.com/ljm198134/TVGTANet.

Conclusion: ReasoningTrack通过推理生成语言描述显著提升了视觉语言跟踪性能，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Vision-language tracking has received increasing attention in recent years,
as textual information can effectively address the inflexibility and inaccuracy
associated with specifying the target object to be tracked. Existing works
either directly fuse the fixed language with vision features or simply modify
using attention, however, their performance is still limited. Recently, some
researchers have explored using text generation to adapt to the variations in
the target during tracking, however, these works fail to provide insights into
the model's reasoning process and do not fully leverage the advantages of large
models, which further limits their overall performance. To address the
aforementioned issues, this paper proposes a novel reasoning-based
vision-language tracking framework, named ReasoningTrack, based on a
pre-trained vision-language model Qwen2.5-VL. Both SFT (Supervised Fine-Tuning)
and reinforcement learning GRPO are used for the optimization of reasoning and
language generation. We embed the updated language descriptions and feed them
into a unified tracking backbone network together with vision features. Then,
we adopt a tracking head to predict the specific location of the target object.
In addition, we propose a large-scale long-term vision-language tracking
benchmark dataset, termed TNLLT, which contains 200 video sequences. 20
baseline visual trackers are re-trained and evaluated on this dataset, which
builds a solid foundation for the vision-language visual tracking task.
Extensive experiments on multiple vision-language tracking benchmark datasets
fully validated the effectiveness of our proposed reasoning-based natural
language generation strategy. The source code of this paper will be released on

Conclusion: 现代视觉基础模型为解决复杂气泡分割问题提供了新思路。

Abstract: Segmenting gas bubbles in multiphase flows is a critical yet unsolved
challenge in numerous industrial settings, from metallurgical processing to
maritime drag reduction. Traditional approaches-and most recent learning-based
methods-assume near-spherical shapes, limiting their effectiveness in regimes
where bubbles undergo deformation, coalescence, or breakup. This complexity is
particularly evident in air lubrication systems, where coalesced bubbles form
amorphous and topologically diverse patches. In this work, we revisit the
problem through the lens of modern vision foundation models. We cast the task
as a transfer learning problem and demonstrate, for the first time, that a
fine-tuned Segment Anything Model SAM v2.1 can accurately segment highly
non-convex, irregular bubble structures using as few as 100 annotated images.

Abstract: Arbitrary viewpoint image generation holds significant potential for
autonomous driving, yet remains a challenging task due to the lack of
ground-truth data for extrapolated views, which hampers the training of
high-fidelity generative models. In this work, we propose Arbiviewgen, a novel
diffusion-based framework for the generation of controllable camera images from
arbitrary points of view. To address the absence of ground-truth data in unseen
views, we introduce two key components: Feature-Aware Adaptive View Stitching
(FAVS) and Cross-View Consistency Self-Supervised Learning (CVC-SSL). FAVS
employs a hierarchical matching strategy that first establishes coarse
geometric correspondences using camera poses, then performs fine-grained
alignment through improved feature matching algorithms, and identifies
high-confidence matching regions via clustering analysis. Building upon this,
CVC-SSL adopts a self-supervised training paradigm where the model reconstructs
the original camera views from the synthesized stitched images using a
diffusion model, enforcing cross-view consistency without requiring supervision
from extrapolated data. Our framework requires only multi-camera images and
their associated poses for training, eliminating the need for additional
sensors or depth maps. To our knowledge, Arbiviewgen is the first method
capable of controllable arbitrary view camera image generation in multiple
vehicle configurations.

Motivation: 研究视觉语言模型在零样本对抗鲁棒性领域的挑战，特别是对抗鲁棒性与泛化能力之间的权衡问题。

Method: 分析两种防御范式：对抗微调（AFT）和训练无关/测试时防御，并梳理了从对齐保持方法到嵌入空间重构的演变。

Result: 总结了不同防御方法的优缺点，并提出了未来研究方向，如混合防御策略和对抗预训练。

Conclusion: 视觉语言模型的零样本对抗鲁棒性研究仍面临挑战，未来需探索更高效的防御策略。

Abstract: This report synthesizes eight seminal papers on the zero-shot adversarial
robustness of vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP. A central challenge in
this domain is the inherent trade-off between enhancing adversarial robustness
and preserving the model's zero-shot generalization capabilities. We analyze
two primary defense paradigms: Adversarial Fine-Tuning (AFT), which modifies
model parameters, and Training-Free/Test-Time Defenses, which preserve them. We
trace the evolution from alignment-preserving methods (TeCoA) to embedding
space re-engineering (LAAT, TIMA), and from input heuristics (AOM, TTC) to
latent-space purification (CLIPure). Finally, we identify key challenges and
future directions including hybrid defense strategies and adversarial
pre-training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决医学图像理解中高质量标注数据有限和全局特征忽略局部病理区域的问题。

Result: 在图像-文本检索、零样本分类和视觉问答任务中显著优于现有模型。

Conclusion: 区域感知对比预训练对医学图像理解至关重要，RegionMed-CLIP为多模态医学图像理解提供了坚实基础。

Abstract: Medical image understanding plays a crucial role in enabling automated
diagnosis and data-driven clinical decision support. However, its progress is
impeded by two primary challenges: the limited availability of high-quality
annotated medical data and an overreliance on global image features, which
often miss subtle but clinically significant pathological regions. To address
these issues, we introduce RegionMed-CLIP, a region-aware multimodal
contrastive learning framework that explicitly incorporates localized
pathological signals along with holistic semantic representations. The core of
our method is an innovative region-of-interest (ROI) processor that adaptively
integrates fine-grained regional features with the global context, supported by
a progressive training strategy that enhances hierarchical multimodal
alignment. To enable large-scale region-level representation learning, we
construct MedRegion-500k, a comprehensive medical image-text corpus that
features extensive regional annotations and multilevel clinical descriptions.
Extensive experiments on image-text retrieval, zero-shot classification, and
visual question answering tasks demonstrate that RegionMed-CLIP consistently
exceeds state-of-the-art vision language models by a wide margin. Our results
highlight the critical importance of region-aware contrastive pre-training and
position RegionMed-CLIP as a robust foundation for advancing multimodal medical
image understanding.

Abstract: Gender classification is attractive in a range of applications, including
surveillance and monitoring, corporate profiling, and human-computer
interaction. Individuals' identities may be gleaned from information about
their gender, which is a kind of soft biometric.Over the years, several methods
for determining a person's gender have been devised. Some of the most
well-known ones are based on physical characteristics like face, fingerprint,
palmprint, DNA, ears, gait, and iris. On the other hand, facial features
account for the vast majority of gender classification methods. Also, the iris
is a significant biometric trait because the iris, according to research,
remains basically constant during an individual's life. Besides that, the iris
is externally visible and is non-invasive to the user, which is important for
practical applications. Furthermore, there are already high-quality methods for
segmenting and encoding iris images, and the current methods facilitate
selecting and extracting attribute vectors from iris textures. This study
discusses several approaches to determining gender. The previous works of
literature are briefly reviewed. Additionally, there are a variety of
methodologies for different steps of gender classification. This study provides
researchers with knowledge and analysis of the existing gender classification
approaches. Also, it will assist researchers who are interested in this
specific area, as well as highlight the gaps and challenges in the field, and
finally provide suggestions and future paths for improvement.

Result: CF3方法仅需5%的高斯数量即可实现与Feature-3DGS竞争的特征场表现。

Conclusion: 提出的方法显著提升了3D高斯特征场的效率和紧凑性。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has begun incorporating rich information from 2D
foundation models. However, most approaches rely on a bottom-up optimization
process that treats raw 2D features as ground truth, incurring increased
computational costs. We propose a top-down pipeline for constructing compact
and fast 3D Gaussian feature fields, namely, CF3. We first perform a fast
weighted fusion of multi-view 2D features with pre-trained Gaussians. This
approach enables training a per-Gaussian autoencoder directly on the lifted
features, instead of training autoencoders in the 2D domain. As a result, the
autoencoder better aligns with the feature distribution. More importantly, we
introduce an adaptive sparsification method that optimizes the Gaussian
attributes of the feature field while pruning and merging the redundant
Gaussians, constructing an efficient representation with preserved geometric
details. Our approach achieves a competitive 3D feature field using as little
as 5% of the Gaussians compared to Feature-3DGS.

Conclusion: SGDFuse通过语义引导的扩散模型，有效解决了图像融合中的核心挑战，提供了高性能的解决方案。

Abstract: Infrared and visible image fusion (IVIF) aims to combine the thermal
radiation information from infrared images with the rich texture details from
visible images to enhance perceptual capabilities for downstream visual tasks.
However, existing methods often fail to preserve key targets due to a lack of
deep semantic understanding of the scene, while the fusion process itself can
also introduce artifacts and detail loss, severely compromising both image
quality and task performance. To address these issues, this paper proposes
SGDFuse, a conditional diffusion model guided by the Segment Anything Model
(SAM), to achieve high-fidelity and semantically-aware image fusion. The core
of our method is to utilize high-quality semantic masks generated by SAM as
explicit priors to guide the optimization of the fusion process via a
conditional diffusion model. Specifically, the framework operates in a
two-stage process: it first performs a preliminary fusion of multi-modal
features, and then utilizes the semantic masks from SAM jointly with the
preliminary fused image as a condition to drive the diffusion model's
coarse-to-fine denoising generation. This ensures the fusion process not only
has explicit semantic directionality but also guarantees the high fidelity of
the final result. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SGDFuse achieves
state-of-the-art performance in both subjective and objective evaluations, as
well as in its adaptability to downstream tasks, providing a powerful solution
to the core challenges in image fusion. The code of SGDFuse is available at

Conclusion: B4DL填补了4D LiDAR在MLLMs中的空白，为动态户外环境提供了有效的理解和推理工具。

Abstract: Understanding dynamic outdoor environments requires capturing complex object
interactions and their evolution over time. LiDAR-based 4D point clouds provide
precise spatial geometry and rich temporal cues, making them ideal for
representing real-world scenes. However, despite their potential, 4D LiDAR
remains underexplored in the context of Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) due to the absence of high-quality, modality-specific annotations and
the lack of MLLM architectures capable of processing its high-dimensional
composition. To address these challenges, we introduce B4DL, a new benchmark
specifically designed for training and evaluating MLLMs on 4D LiDAR
understanding. In addition, we propose a scalable data generation pipeline and
an MLLM model that, for the first time, directly processes raw 4D LiDAR by
bridging it with language understanding. Combined with our dataset and
benchmark, our model offers a unified solution for spatio-temporal reasoning in
dynamic outdoor environments. We provide rendered 4D LiDAR videos, generated

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于小波变换的双频编码方法（WGDF），通过频域特征建模提升遥感图像变化检测的精度，特别是在边缘细节和全局结构上取得了显著效果。

Motivation: 现有方法主要依赖空间域建模，特征表示多样性有限，难以捕捉细微变化区域。频域特征建模（如小波域）可以放大频率分量的细粒度差异，增强边缘变化的感知能力。

Method: 使用离散小波变换（DWT）分解图像为高频和低频成分，分别建模局部细节和全局结构。高频分支设计了双频特征增强模块（DFFE）和频域交互差异模块（FDID）；低频分支利用Transformer捕获全局语义关系，并采用渐进上下文差异模块（PCDM）逐步优化变化区域。最后融合高低频特征。

Result: 在多个遥感数据集上的实验表明，WGDF显著减轻了边缘模糊问题，检测精度和鲁棒性优于现有方法。

Conclusion: WGDF通过频域特征建模和双频协同融合，有效提升了遥感图像变化检测的性能，特别是在边缘细节和全局结构上表现优异。

Abstract: Change detection in remote sensing imagery plays a vital role in various
engineering applications, such as natural disaster monitoring, urban expansion
tracking, and infrastructure management. Despite the remarkable progress of
deep learning in recent years, most existing methods still rely on
spatial-domain modeling, where the limited diversity of feature representations
hinders the detection of subtle change regions. We observe that
frequency-domain feature modeling particularly in the wavelet domain an amplify
fine-grained differences in frequency components, enhancing the perception of
edge changes that are challenging to capture in the spatial domain. Thus, we
propose a method called Wavelet-Guided Dual-Frequency Encoding (WGDF).
Specifically, we first apply Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) to decompose the
input images into high-frequency and low-frequency components, which are used
to model local details and global structures, respectively. In the
high-frequency branch, we design a Dual-Frequency Feature Enhancement (DFFE)
module to strengthen edge detail representation and introduce a
Frequency-Domain Interactive Difference (FDID) module to enhance the modeling
of fine-grained changes. In the low-frequency branch, we exploit Transformers
to capture global semantic relationships and employ a Progressive Contextual
Difference Module (PCDM) to progressively refine change regions, enabling
precise structural semantic characterization. Finally, the high- and
low-frequency features are synergistically fused to unify local sensitivity
with global discriminability. Extensive experiments on multiple remote sensing
datasets demonstrate that WGDF significantly alleviates edge ambiguity and
achieves superior detection accuracy and robustness compared to
state-of-the-art methods. The code will be available at
https://github.com/boshizhang123/WGDF.

Motivation: 传统PPAT草图解读依赖心理学家经验且耗时，需自动化工具支持大规模分析。

Method: 结合实验环境和VS-LLM方法，自动分析PPAT草图的颜色和空间利用等特征。

Result: VS-LLM方法比心理学家评估准确率提升17.6%。

Conclusion: 该方法为基于PPAT草图的心理状态评估研究提供了新工具，数据集和代码已开源。

Abstract: The Drawing Projection Test (DPT) is an essential tool in art therapy,
allowing psychologists to assess participants' mental states through their
sketches. Specifically, through sketches with the theme of "a person picking an
apple from a tree (PPAT)", it can be revealed whether the participants are in
mental states such as depression. Compared with scales, the DPT can enrich
psychologists' understanding of an individual's mental state. However, the
interpretation of the PPAT is laborious and depends on the experience of the
psychologists. To address this issue, we propose an effective identification
method to support psychologists in conducting a large-scale automatic DPT.
Unlike traditional sketch recognition, DPT more focus on the overall evaluation
of the sketches, such as color usage and space utilization. Moreover, PPAT
imposes a time limit and prohibits verbal reminders, resulting in low drawing
accuracy and a lack of detailed depiction. To address these challenges, we
propose the following efforts: (1) Providing an experimental environment for
automated analysis of PPAT sketches for depression assessment; (2) Offering a
Visual-Semantic depression assessment based on LLM (VS-LLM) method; (3)
Experimental results demonstrate that our method improves by 17.6% compared to
the psychologist assessment method. We anticipate that this work will
contribute to the research in mental state assessment based on PPAT sketches'
elements recognition. Our datasets and codes are available at

Conclusion: CoCAViT通过CoCA机制有效提升小模型的泛化能力和性能，适用于实时视觉任务。

Abstract: In recent years, large-scale visual backbones have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in learning general-purpose features from images via extensive
pre-training. Concurrently, many efficient architectures have emerged that have
performance comparable to that of larger models on in-domain benchmarks.
However, we observe that for smaller models, the performance drop on
out-of-distribution (OOD) data is disproportionately larger, indicating a
deficiency in the generalization performance of existing efficient models. To
address this, we identify key architectural bottlenecks and inappropriate
design choices that contribute to this issue, retaining robustness for smaller
models. To restore the global field of pure window attention, we further
introduce a Coordinator-patch Cross Attention (CoCA) mechanism, featuring
dynamic, domain-aware global tokens that enhance local-global feature modeling
and adaptively capture robust patterns across domains with minimal
computational overhead. Integrating these advancements, we present CoCAViT, a
novel visual backbone designed for robust real-time visual representation.
Extensive experiments empirically validate our design. At a resolution of
224*224, CoCAViT-28M achieves 84.0% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K, with
significant gains on multiple OOD benchmarks, compared to competing models. It
also attains 52.2 mAP on COCO object detection and 51.3 mIOU on ADE20K semantic
segmentation, while maintaining low latency.

Conclusion: 多模态知识图谱的引入有效提升了RAG框架在VQA任务中的表现，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Recently, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has been proposed to expand
internal knowledge of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) by incorporating
external knowledge databases into the generation process, which is widely used
for knowledge-based Visual Question Answering (VQA) tasks. Despite impressive
advancements, vanilla RAG-based VQA methods that rely on unstructured documents
and overlook the structural relationships among knowledge elements frequently
introduce irrelevant or misleading content, reducing answer accuracy and
reliability. To overcome these challenges, a promising solution is to integrate
multimodal knowledge graphs (KGs) into RAG-based VQA frameworks to enhance the
generation by introducing structured multimodal knowledge. Therefore, in this
paper, we propose a novel multimodal knowledge-augmented generation framework
(mKG-RAG) based on multimodal KGs for knowledge-intensive VQA tasks.
Specifically, our approach leverages MLLM-powered keyword extraction and
vision-text matching to distill semantically consistent and modality-aligned
entities/relationships from multimodal documents, constructing high-quality
multimodal KGs as structured knowledge representations. In addition, a
dual-stage retrieval strategy equipped with a question-aware multimodal
retriever is introduced to improve retrieval efficiency while refining
precision. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our approach
significantly outperforms existing methods, setting a new state-of-the-art for
knowledge-based VQA.

Motivation: 尽管大型预训练视觉语言模型在目标检测任务中表现出色，但针对特定目标的微调通常会丧失其自然语言查询和零样本能力。本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 采用类似于文本反转（TI）的方法，通过学习新的或改进现有的词嵌入，仅需少量样本即可扩展VLM的词汇表，同时保持原始模型权重不变。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在保留原始模型性能的同时，显著优于基线方法，且计算成本更低。

Conclusion: 该方法为开放词汇目标检测提供了一种高效且兼容的解决方案，同时保留了模型的零样本能力。

Abstract: Recent progress in large pre-trained vision language models (VLMs) has
reached state-of-the-art performance on several object detection benchmarks and
boasts strong zero-shot capabilities, but for optimal performance on specific
targets some form of finetuning is still necessary. While the initial VLM
weights allow for great few-shot transfer learning, this usually involves the
loss of the original natural language querying and zero-shot capabilities.
Inspired by the success of Textual Inversion (TI) in personalizing
text-to-image diffusion models, we propose a similar formulation for
open-vocabulary object detection. TI allows extending the VLM vocabulary by
learning new or improving existing tokens to accurately detect novel or
fine-grained objects from as little as three examples. The learned tokens are
completely compatible with the original VLM weights while keeping them frozen,
retaining the original model's benchmark performance, and leveraging its
existing capabilities such as zero-shot domain transfer (e.g., detecting a
sketch of an object after training only on real photos). The storage and
gradient calculations are limited to the token embedding dimension, requiring
significantly less compute than full-model fine-tuning. We evaluated whether
the method matches or outperforms the baseline methods that suffer from
forgetting in a wide variety of quantitative and qualitative experiments.

Conclusion: 3DGabSplat是一种高效且高质量的3D渲染方法，可无缝集成现有3DGS框架。

Abstract: Recent prominence in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has enabled real-time
rendering while maintaining high-fidelity novel view synthesis. However, 3DGS
resorts to the Gaussian function that is low-pass by nature and is restricted
in representing high-frequency details in 3D scenes. Moreover, it causes
redundant primitives with degraded training and rendering efficiency and
excessive memory overhead. To overcome these limitations, we propose 3D Gabor
Splatting (3DGabSplat) that leverages a novel 3D Gabor-based primitive with
multiple directional 3D frequency responses for radiance field representation
supervised by multi-view images. The proposed 3D Gabor-based primitive forms a
filter bank incorporating multiple 3D Gabor kernels at different frequencies to
enhance flexibility and efficiency in capturing fine 3D details. Furthermore,
to achieve novel view rendering, an efficient CUDA-based rasterizer is
developed to project the multiple directional 3D frequency components
characterized by 3D Gabor-based primitives onto the 2D image plane, and a
frequency-adaptive mechanism is presented for adaptive joint optimization of
primitives. 3DGabSplat is scalable to be a plug-and-play kernel for seamless
integration into existing 3DGS paradigms to enhance both efficiency and quality
of novel view synthesis. Extensive experiments demonstrate that 3DGabSplat
outperforms 3DGS and its variants using alternative primitives, and achieves
state-of-the-art rendering quality across both real-world and synthetic scenes.
Remarkably, we achieve up to 1.35 dB PSNR gain over 3DGS with simultaneously
reduced number of primitives and memory consumption.

Conclusion: PriorRG通过有效利用先验知识，提高了报告生成的临床准确性和流畅性，为自动报告生成提供了新思路。

Abstract: Chest X-ray report generation aims to reduce radiologists' workload by
automatically producing high-quality preliminary reports. A critical yet
underexplored aspect of this task is the effective use of patient-specific
prior knowledge -- including clinical context (e.g., symptoms, medical history)
and the most recent prior image -- which radiologists routinely rely on for
diagnostic reasoning. Most existing methods generate reports from single
images, neglecting this essential prior information and thus failing to capture
diagnostic intent or disease progression. To bridge this gap, we propose
PriorRG, a novel chest X-ray report generation framework that emulates
real-world clinical workflows via a two-stage training pipeline. In Stage 1, we
introduce a prior-guided contrastive pre-training scheme that leverages
clinical context to guide spatiotemporal feature extraction, allowing the model
to align more closely with the intrinsic spatiotemporal semantics in radiology
reports. In Stage 2, we present a prior-aware coarse-to-fine decoding for
report generation that progressively integrates patient-specific prior
knowledge with the vision encoder's hidden states. This decoding allows the
model to align with diagnostic focus and track disease progression, thereby
enhancing the clinical accuracy and fluency of the generated reports. Extensive
experiments on MIMIC-CXR and MIMIC-ABN datasets demonstrate that PriorRG
outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving a 3.6% BLEU-4 and 3.8% F1 score
improvement on MIMIC-CXR, and a 5.9% BLEU-1 gain on MIMIC-ABN. Code and
checkpoints will be released upon acceptance.

TL;DR: Slice-Loc提出了一种两阶段方法，通过子图像分割和几何验证提升跨视角定位的可靠性和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有跨视角定位方法缺乏冗余观测，难以验证定位可靠性。

Method: 将查询图像分割为子图像，估计每个子图像的3自由度位姿，通过几何刚性公式过滤错误位姿并合并内点。

Result: Slice-Loc显著降低了定位误差，在DReSS数据集上平均定位误差从4.47米降至1.86米。

Conclusion: Slice-Loc通过冗余观测和几何验证提高了定位的可靠性和准确性。

Abstract: Cross-view localization (CVL) matches ground-level images with aerial
references to determine the geo-position of a camera, enabling smart vehicles
to self-localize offline in GNSS-denied environments. However, most CVL methods
output only a single observation, the camera pose, and lack the redundant
observations required by surveying principles, making it challenging to assess
localization reliability through the mutual validation of observational data.
To tackle this, we introduce Slice-Loc, a two-stage method featuring an
a-contrario reliability validation for CVL. Instead of using the query image as
a single input, Slice-Loc divides it into sub-images and estimates the 3-DoF
pose for each slice, creating redundant and independent observations. Then, a
geometric rigidity formula is proposed to filter out the erroneous 3-DoF poses,
and the inliers are merged to generate the final camera pose. Furthermore, we
propose a model that quantifies the meaningfulness of localization by
estimating the number of false alarms (NFA), according to the distribution of
the locations of the sliced images. By eliminating gross errors, Slice-Loc
boosts localization accuracy and effectively detects failures. After filtering
out mislocalizations, Slice-Loc reduces the proportion of errors exceeding 10 m
to under 3\%. In cross-city tests on the DReSS dataset, Slice-Loc cuts the mean
localization error from 4.47 m to 1.86 m and the mean orientation error from
$\mathbf{3.42^{\circ}}$ to $\mathbf{1.24^{\circ}}$, outperforming
state-of-the-art methods. Code and dataset will be available at:

TL;DR: CT-GRAPH是一种分层图注意力网络，通过将解剖区域建模为图，结合细粒度器官特征与全局患者上下文，提升放射学报告的生成准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动化放射学报告生成可减轻放射科医生的工作负担，但现有方法仅依赖全局图像特征，忽略了细粒度器官关系。

Method: 使用预训练的3D医学特征编码器获取全局和器官级特征，通过图注意力网络细化特征，并结合大型语言模型生成报告。

Result: 在CT-RATE数据集上，CT-GRAPH的F1分数比现有最佳方法提高了7.9%。

Conclusion: CT-GRAPH通过显式建模放射学知识，显著提升了放射学报告的生成质量。

Abstract: As medical imaging is central to diagnostic processes, automating the
generation of radiology reports has become increasingly relevant to assist
radiologists with their heavy workloads. Most current methods rely solely on
global image features, failing to capture fine-grained organ relationships
crucial for accurate reporting. To this end, we propose CT-GRAPH, a
hierarchical graph attention network that explicitly models radiological
knowledge by structuring anatomical regions into a graph, linking fine-grained
organ features to coarser anatomical systems and a global patient context. Our
method leverages pretrained 3D medical feature encoders to obtain global and
organ-level features by utilizing anatomical masks. These features are further
refined within the graph and then integrated into a large language model to
generate detailed medical reports. We evaluate our approach for the task of
report generation on the large-scale chest CT dataset CT-RATE. We provide an
in-depth analysis of pretrained feature encoders for CT report generation and
show that our method achieves a substantial improvement of absolute 7.9\% in F1
score over current state-of-the-art methods. The code is publicly available at

Motivation: 现有方法难以捕捉组织结构的空间依赖性，且传统注意力机制缺乏特异性。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: 可变形注意力能有效捕捉复杂空间结构，提升病理图像分析能力。

Abstract: Accurate classification of Whole Slide Images (WSIs) and Regions of Interest
(ROIs) is a fundamental challenge in computational pathology. While mainstream
approaches often adopt Multiple Instance Learning (MIL), they struggle to
capture the spatial dependencies among tissue structures. Graph Neural Networks
(GNNs) have emerged as a solution to model inter-instance relationships, yet
most rely on static graph topologies and overlook the physical spatial
positions of tissue patches. Moreover, conventional attention mechanisms lack
specificity, limiting their ability to focus on structurally relevant regions.
In this work, we propose a novel GNN framework with deformable attention for
pathology image analysis. We construct a dynamic weighted directed graph based
on patch features, where each node aggregates contextual information from its
neighbors via attention-weighted edges. Specifically, we incorporate learnable
spatial offsets informed by the real coordinates of each patch, enabling the
model to adaptively attend to morphologically relevant regions across the
slide. This design significantly enhances the contextual field while preserving
spatial specificity. Our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on
four benchmark datasets (TCGA-COAD, BRACS, gastric intestinal metaplasia
grading, and intestinal ROI classification), demonstrating the power of
deformable attention in capturing complex spatial structures in WSIs and ROIs.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为UNCAGE的无训练方法，通过利用注意力图优先解掩代表单个对象的标记，提升了文本到图像生成的组合保真度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管扩散模型和掩码生成变换器在文本到图像生成中表现优异，但组合生成仍存在挑战，尤其是属性绑定和文本图像对齐问题。

Method: 提出UNCAGE方法，利用注意力图指导解掩过程，优先处理明确代表单个对象的标记。

Result: UNCAGE在多个基准和指标上均显著提升了性能，且推理开销可忽略不计。

Conclusion: UNCAGE为组合文本到图像生成提供了一种高效且无需额外训练的新方法。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) generation has been actively studied using Diffusion
Models and Autoregressive Models. Recently, Masked Generative Transformers have
gained attention as an alternative to Autoregressive Models to overcome the
inherent limitations of causal attention and autoregressive decoding through
bidirectional attention and parallel decoding, enabling efficient and
high-quality image generation. However, compositional T2I generation remains
challenging, as even state-of-the-art Diffusion Models often fail to accurately
bind attributes and achieve proper text-image alignment. While Diffusion Models
have been extensively studied for this issue, Masked Generative Transformers
exhibit similar limitations but have not been explored in this context. To
address this, we propose Unmasking with Contrastive Attention Guidance
(UNCAGE), a novel training-free method that improves compositional fidelity by
leveraging attention maps to prioritize the unmasking of tokens that clearly
represent individual objects. UNCAGE consistently improves performance in both
quantitative and qualitative evaluations across multiple benchmarks and
metrics, with negligible inference overhead. Our code is available at

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有防御机制在检测和修复被投毒图像时面临挑战，可能损害数据实用性，影响系统可靠性。

Method: 采用多数投票机制结合多个先进的大型视觉语言模型，检测投毒图像，并通过校准噪声修正。

Result: TrueBiometric能100%准确检测并修正投毒图像，且不影响干净图像的准确性。

Conclusion: TrueBiometric为抵御人脸识别系统中的后门攻击提供了更实用、准确和有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Biometric systems, such as face recognition systems powered by deep neural
networks (DNNs), rely on large and highly sensitive datasets. Backdoor attacks
can subvert these systems by manipulating the training process. By inserting a
small trigger, such as a sticker, make-up, or patterned mask, into a few
training images, an adversary can later present the same trigger during
authentication to be falsely recognized as another individual, thereby gaining
unauthorized access. Existing defense mechanisms against backdoor attacks still
face challenges in precisely identifying and mitigating poisoned images without
compromising data utility, which undermines the overall reliability of the
system. We propose a novel and generalizable approach, TrueBiometric:
Trustworthy Biometrics, which accurately detects poisoned images using a
majority voting mechanism leveraging multiple state-of-the-art large vision
language models. Once identified, poisoned samples are corrected using targeted
and calibrated corrective noise. Our extensive empirical results demonstrate
that TrueBiometric detects and corrects poisoned images with 100\% accuracy
without compromising accuracy on clean images. Compared to existing
state-of-the-art approaches, TrueBiometric offers a more practical, accurate,
and effective solution for mitigating backdoor attacks in face recognition
systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 物理对抗性伪装对安全关键领域（如自动驾驶）构成重大威胁，现有技术因环境变化导致梯度优化不稳定和攻击效果差。

Method: 提出梯度校准策略确保跨距离梯度一致性，并开发梯度去相关方法优化多角度梯度更新。

Conclusion: 研究强调了更鲁棒系统设计的必要性，并展示了新方法在对抗性伪装中的优越性。

Abstract: The advancement of deep object detectors has greatly affected safety-critical
fields like autonomous driving. However, physical adversarial camouflage poses
a significant security risk by altering object textures to deceive detectors.
Existing techniques struggle with variable physical environments, facing two
main challenges: 1) inconsistent sampling point densities across distances
hinder the gradient optimization from ensuring local continuity, and 2)
updating texture gradients from multiple angles causes conflicts, reducing
optimization stability and attack effectiveness. To address these issues, we
propose a novel adversarial camouflage framework based on gradient
optimization. First, we introduce a gradient calibration strategy, which
ensures consistent gradient updates across distances by propagating gradients
from sparsely to unsampled texture points. Additionally, we develop a gradient
decorrelation method, which prioritizes and orthogonalizes gradients based on
loss values, enhancing stability and effectiveness in multi-angle optimization
by eliminating redundant or conflicting updates. Extensive experimental results
on various detection models, angles and distances show that our method
significantly exceeds the state of the art, with an average increase in attack
success rate (ASR) of 13.46% across distances and 11.03% across angles.
Furthermore, empirical evaluation in real-world scenarios highlights the need
for more robust system design.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Slot Attention (SA) 及其变体是主流对象中心学习 (OCL) 的核心。本文提出 SmoothSA，通过预热冷启动查询和区分视频帧的变换，解决了 SA 在图像和视频中的聚合问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 冷启动查询缺乏样本特定信息，影响图像或视频首帧的精确聚合；非首帧查询已具备样本特定性，需要不同的变换方式。

Method: SmoothSA 通过自蒸馏模块预热冷启动查询，并在视频帧间区分变换方式（首帧用完整迭代，非首帧用单次迭代）。

Result: 在对象发现、识别和下游基准测试中验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: SmoothSA 显著改善了 SA 的迭代和循环效果，代码已开源。

Abstract: Slot Attention (SA) and its variants lie at the heart of mainstream
Object-Centric Learning (OCL). Objects in an image can be aggregated into
respective slot vectors, by \textit{iteratively} refining cold-start query
vectors, typically three times, via SA on image features. For video, such
aggregation is \textit{recurrently} shared across frames, with queries
cold-started on the first frame while transitioned from the previous frame's
slots on non-first frames. However, the cold-start queries lack sample-specific
cues thus hinder precise aggregation on the image or video's first frame; Also,
non-first frames' queries are already sample-specific thus require transforms
different from the first frame's aggregation. We address these issues for the
first time with our \textit{SmoothSA}: (1) To smooth SA iterations on the image
or video's first frame, we \textit{preheat} the cold-start queries with rich
information of input features, via a tiny module self-distilled inside OCL; (2)
To smooth SA recurrences across all video frames, we \textit{differentiate} the
homogeneous transforms on the first and non-first frames, by using full and
single iterations respectively. Comprehensive experiments on object discovery,
recognition and downstream benchmarks validate our method's effectiveness.
Further analyses intuitively illuminate how our method smooths SA iterations
and recurrences. Our code is available in the supplement.

Motivation: 传统显著性方法仅捕捉一阶属性，忽略了跨模态交互的复杂性，需要更全面的解释方法。

Method: 利用加权Banzhaf交互指数，提出FIxLIP方法，并扩展解释评估指标到二阶交互。

Result: 在MS COCO和ImageNet-1k基准测试中，FIxLIP优于一阶方法，并能有效比较不同模型。

Conclusion: FIxLIP提供高质量解释，并展示了在模型比较中的实用性。

Abstract: Language-image pre-training (LIP) enables the development of vision-language
models capable of zero-shot classification, localization, multimodal retrieval,
and semantic understanding. Various explanation methods have been proposed to
visualize the importance of input image-text pairs on the model's similarity
outputs. However, popular saliency maps are limited by capturing only
first-order attributions, overlooking the complex cross-modal interactions
intrinsic to such encoders. We introduce faithful interaction explanations of
LIP models (FIxLIP) as a unified approach to decomposing the similarity in
vision-language encoders. FIxLIP is rooted in game theory, where we analyze how
using the weighted Banzhaf interaction index offers greater flexibility and
improves computational efficiency over the Shapley interaction quantification
framework. From a practical perspective, we propose how to naturally extend
explanation evaluation metrics, like the pointing game and area between the
insertion/deletion curves, to second-order interaction explanations.
Experiments on MS COCO and ImageNet-1k benchmarks validate that second-order
methods like FIxLIP outperform first-order attribution methods. Beyond
delivering high-quality explanations, we demonstrate the utility of FIxLIP in
comparing different models like CLIP vs. SigLIP-2 and ViT-B/32 vs. ViT-L/16.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Flow Matching（FM）的无监督异常检测与定位新范式，解决了传统流方法的表达能力限制。通过时间反转FM（rFM）和Worst Transport（WT）位移插值，构建了非概率演化路径，实现了对异常样本的理论分离。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统流方法在模型表达能力上存在局限，无法有效处理异常检测任务。本文旨在通过FM和rFM解决这一问题，并提出WT-Flow增强动态控制。

Method: 提出时间反转FM（rFM）作为向量场回归方法，结合WT位移插值构建非概率演化路径，形成“退化势阱”分离异常样本。

Result: 在MVTec数据集上实现了单尺度下的最先进性能，验证了FM在无监督异常检测中的有效性。

Conclusion: FM为无监督异常检测提供了理论支持，WT-Flow增强了动态控制能力，为复杂数据的异常检测提供了可扩展框架。

Abstract: We propose a new paradigm for unsupervised anomaly detection and localization
using Flow Matching (FM), which fundamentally addresses the model expressivity
limitations of conventional flow-based methods. To this end, we formalize the
concept of time-reversed Flow Matching (rFM) as a vector field regression along
a predefined probability path to transform unknown data distributions into
standard Gaussian. We bring two core observations that reshape our
understanding of FM. First, we rigorously prove that FM with linear
interpolation probability paths is inherently non-invertible. Second, our
analysis reveals that employing reversed Gaussian probability paths in
high-dimensional spaces can lead to trivial vector fields. This issue arises
due to the manifold-related constraints. Building on the second observation, we
propose Worst Transport (WT) displacement interpolation to reconstruct a
non-probabilistic evolution path. The proposed WT-Flow enhances dynamical
control over sample trajectories, constructing ''degenerate potential wells''
for anomaly-free samples while allowing anomalous samples to escape. This novel
unsupervised paradigm offers a theoretically grounded separation mechanism for
anomalous samples. Notably, FM provides a computationally tractable framework
that scales to complex data. We present the first successful application of FM
for the unsupervised anomaly detection task, achieving state-of-the-art
performance at a single scale on the MVTec dataset. The reproducible code for
training will be released upon camera-ready submission.

Result: F2PASeg能实时稳定分割关键解剖结构，适应术中变化。

Conclusion: F2PASeg为垂体手术规划提供了可靠解决方案。

Abstract: Pituitary tumors often cause deformation or encapsulation of adjacent vital
structures. Anatomical structure segmentation can provide surgeons with early
warnings of regions that pose surgical risks, thereby enhancing the safety of
pituitary surgery. However, pixel-level annotated video stream datasets for
pituitary surgeries are extremely rare. To address this challenge, we introduce
a new dataset for Pituitary Anatomy Segmentation (PAS). PAS comprises 7,845
time-coherent images extracted from 120 videos. To mitigate class imbalance, we
apply data augmentation techniques that simulate the presence of surgical
instruments in the training data. One major challenge in pituitary anatomy
segmentation is the inconsistency in feature representation due to occlusions,
camera motion, and surgical bleeding. By incorporating a Feature Fusion module,
F2PASeg is proposed to refine anatomical structure segmentation by leveraging
both high-resolution image features and deep semantic embeddings, enhancing
robustness against intraoperative variations. Experimental results demonstrate
that F2PASeg consistently segments critical anatomical structures in real time,
providing a reliable solution for intraoperative pituitary surgery planning.

Result: 高真实感重建的压缩模型对攻击更具抵抗力，低真实感模型易被攻破。

Conclusion: 真实感重建图像提供固有鲁棒性，未来攻击需克服这一挑战。

Abstract: Previous work has suggested that preprocessing images through lossy
compression can defend against adversarial perturbations, but comprehensive
attack evaluations have been lacking. In this paper, we construct strong
white-box and adaptive attacks against various compression models and identify
a critical challenge for attackers: high realism in reconstructed images
significantly increases attack difficulty. Through rigorous evaluation across
multiple attack scenarios, we demonstrate that compression models capable of
producing realistic, high-fidelity reconstructions are substantially more
resistant to our attacks. In contrast, low-realism compression models can be
broken. Our analysis reveals that this is not due to gradient masking. Rather,
realistic reconstructions maintaining distributional alignment with natural
images seem to offer inherent robustness. This work highlights a significant
obstacle for future adversarial attacks and suggests that developing more
effective techniques to overcome realism represents an essential challenge for
comprehensive security evaluation.

Result: SMOL-MapSeg能准确分割OND知识定义的类别，并通过少量样本适应新类别，性能优于UNet。

Conclusion: OND知识提示机制有效解决了历史地图分割的挑战，展现了模型的适应性和优越性。

Abstract: Historical maps are valuable for studying changes to the Earth's surface.
With the rise of deep learning, models like UNet have been used to extract
information from these maps through semantic segmentation. Recently,
pre-trained foundation models have shown strong performance across domains such
as autonomous driving, medical imaging, and industrial inspection. However,
they struggle with historical maps. These models are trained on modern or
domain-specific images, where patterns can be tied to predefined concepts
through common sense or expert knowledge. Historical maps lack such consistency
-- similar concepts can appear in vastly different shapes and styles. To
address this, we propose On-Need Declarative (OND) knowledge-based prompting,
which introduces explicit prompts to guide the model on what patterns
correspond to which concepts. This allows users to specify the target concept
and pattern during inference (on-need inference). We implement this by
replacing the prompt encoder of the foundation model SAM with our OND prompting
mechanism and fine-tune it on historical maps. The resulting model is called
SMOL-MapSeg (Show Me One Label). Experiments show that SMOL-MapSeg can
accurately segment classes defined by OND knowledge. It can also adapt to
unseen classes through few-shot fine-tuning. Additionally, it outperforms a
UNet-based baseline in average segmentation performance.

Abstract: Industrial anomaly detection (IAD) is critical for manufacturing quality
control, but conventionally requires significant manual effort for various
application scenarios. This paper introduces AutoIAD, a multi-agent
collaboration framework, specifically designed for end-to-end automated
development of industrial visual anomaly detection. AutoIAD leverages a
Manager-Driven central agent to orchestrate specialized sub-agents (including
Data Preparation, Data Loader, Model Designer, Trainer) and integrates a
domain-specific knowledge base, which intelligently handles the entire pipeline
using raw industrial image data to develop a trained anomaly detection model.
We construct a comprehensive benchmark using MVTec AD datasets to evaluate
AutoIAD across various LLM backends. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
AutoIAD significantly outperforms existing general-purpose agentic
collaboration frameworks and traditional AutoML frameworks in task completion
rate and model performance (AUROC), while effectively mitigating issues like
hallucination through iterative refinement. Ablation studies further confirm
the crucial roles of the Manager central agent and the domain knowledge base
module in producing robust and high-quality IAD solutions.

Abstract: Chirality information (i.e. information that allows distinguishing left from
right) is ubiquitous for various data modes in computer vision, including
images, videos, point clouds, and meshes. While chirality has been extensively
studied in the image domain, its exploration in shape analysis (such as point
clouds and meshes) remains underdeveloped. Although many shape vertex
descriptors have shown appealing properties (e.g. robustness to rigid-body
transformations), they are often not able to disambiguate between left and
right symmetric parts. Considering the ubiquity of chirality information in
different shape analysis problems and the lack of chirality-aware features
within current shape descriptors, developing a chirality feature extractor
becomes necessary and urgent. Based on the recent Diff3F framework, we propose
an unsupervised chirality feature extraction pipeline to decorate shape
vertices with chirality-aware information, extracted from 2D foundation models.
We evaluated the extracted chirality features through quantitative and
qualitative experiments across diverse datasets. Results from downstream tasks
including left-right disentanglement, shape matching, and part segmentation
demonstrate their effectiveness and practical utility. Project page:

while template-free methods typically assume full object visibility. This
assumption often breaks in real-world settings, where fixed camera viewpoints
and static grips leave parts of the object unobserved, resulting in implausible
reconstructions. To overcome this, we present MagicHOI, a method for
reconstructing hands and objects from short monocular interaction videos, even
under limited viewpoint variation. Our key insight is that, despite the
scarcity of paired 3D hand-object data, large-scale novel view synthesis
diffusion models offer rich object supervision. This supervision serves as a
prior to regularize unseen object regions during hand interactions. Leveraging
this insight, we integrate a novel view synthesis model into our hand-object
reconstruction framework. We further align hand to object by incorporating
visible contact constraints. Our results demonstrate that MagicHOI
significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art hand-object reconstruction
methods. We also show that novel view synthesis diffusion priors effectively
regularize unseen object regions, enhancing 3D hand-object reconstruction.

*Lin Zhu,Ruonan Liu,Xiao Wang,Lizhi Wang,Hua Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种自监督预训练框架，用于从稀疏且噪声较多的事件数据中提取潜在信息，包括边缘和纹理线索。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 事件数据具有高时间分辨率和宽动态范围，但其稀疏性和噪声特性使得特征提取困难。

Method: 框架分为三个阶段：差异引导掩码建模、主干固定的特征转换和聚焦对比学习。

Result: 实验表明，该框架在多个下游任务（如目标识别、语义分割和光流估计）中表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该框架能有效提取事件数据中的潜在信息，提升下游任务的性能。

Abstract: Event camera, a novel neuromorphic vision sensor, records data with high
temporal resolution and wide dynamic range, offering new possibilities for
accurate visual representation in challenging scenarios. However, event data is
inherently sparse and noisy, mainly reflecting brightness changes, which
complicates effective feature extraction. To address this, we propose a
self-supervised pre-training framework to fully reveal latent information in
event data, including edge information and texture cues. Our framework consists
of three stages: Difference-guided Masked Modeling, inspired by the event
physical sampling process, reconstructs temporal intensity difference maps to
extract enhanced information from raw event data. Backbone-fixed Feature
Transition contrasts event and image features without updating the backbone to
preserve representations learned from masked modeling and stabilizing their
effect on contrastive learning. Focus-aimed Contrastive Learning updates the
entire model to improve semantic discrimination by focusing on high-value
regions. Extensive experiments show our framework is robust and consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art methods on various downstream tasks, including
object recognition, semantic segmentation, and optical flow estimation. The
code and dataset are available at https://github.com/BIT-Vision/EventPretrain.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种增强的行人跟踪框架，通过结合更丰富的特征表示和鲁棒的运动模型，解决了遮挡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实应用中，行人跟踪在遮挡情况下表现不佳，传统方法依赖全身特征和线性运动假设，难以应对复杂场景。

Method: 结合检测器的回归和分类分支特征，引入头部关键点检测模型，并采用迭代卡尔曼滤波进行运动建模。

Result: 提出的方法在遮挡严重的拥挤环境中表现更鲁棒。

Conclusion: 通过改进特征和运动模型，该方法显著提升了遮挡情况下的跟踪性能。

Abstract: Visual pedestrian tracking represents a promising research field, with
extensive applications in intelligent surveillance, behavior analysis, and
human-computer interaction. However, real-world applications face significant
occlusion challenges. When multiple pedestrians interact or overlap, the loss
of target features severely compromises the tracker's ability to maintain
stable trajectories. Traditional tracking methods, which typically rely on
full-body bounding box features extracted from {Re-ID} models and linear
constant-velocity motion assumptions, often struggle in severe occlusion
scenarios. To address these limitations, this work proposes an enhanced
tracking framework that leverages richer feature representations and a more
robust motion model. Specifically, the proposed method incorporates detection
features from both the regression and classification branches of an object
detector, embedding spatial and positional information directly into the
feature representations. To further mitigate occlusion challenges, a head
keypoint detection model is introduced, as the head is less prone to occlusion
compared to the full body. In terms of motion modeling, we propose an iterative
Kalman filtering approach designed to align with modern detector assumptions,
integrating 3D priors to better complete motion trajectories in complex scenes.
By combining these advancements in appearance and motion modeling, the proposed
method offers a more robust solution for multi-object tracking in crowded
environments where occlusions are prevalent.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于特征空间随机平滑的新型图像质量评估（IQA）认证防御方法，保留图像保真度并提供鲁棒性保证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法在输入图像中直接注入高斯噪声会降低视觉质量，而新方法通过在特征空间应用噪声避免了这一问题。

Method: 通过分析主干网络Jacobian的最大奇异值，将特征空间噪声与输入空间扰动联系起来，支持全参考和无参考IQA模型。

Result: 在两种基准数据集上验证，与五种先进认证防御方法相比，主观质量分数相关性提升高达30.9%，推理时间显著减少。

Conclusion: 该方法在保持图像质量的同时显著提升了IQA模型的鲁棒性和效率。

Abstract: We propose a novel certified defense method for Image Quality Assessment
(IQA) models based on randomized smoothing with noise applied in the feature
space rather than the input space. Unlike prior approaches that inject Gaussian
noise directly into input images, often degrading visual quality, our method
preserves image fidelity while providing robustness guarantees. To formally
connect noise levels in the feature space with corresponding input-space
perturbations, we analyze the maximum singular value of the backbone network's
Jacobian. Our approach supports both full-reference (FR) and no-reference (NR)
IQA models without requiring any architectural modifications, suitable for
various scenarios. It is also computationally efficient, requiring a single
backbone forward pass per image. Compared to previous methods, it reduces
inference time by 99.5% without certification and by 20.6% when certification
is applied. We validate our method with extensive experiments on two benchmark
datasets, involving six widely-used FR and NR IQA models and comparisons
against five state-of-the-art certified defenses. Our results demonstrate
consistent improvements in correlation with subjective quality scores by up to
30.9%.

Conclusion: AI辅助方法可显著提升临床试验效率，加速药物开发，同时保持合规性。

Abstract: Clinical trial data cleaning represents a critical bottleneck in drug
development, with manual review processes struggling to manage exponentially
increasing data volumes and complexity. This paper presents Octozi, an
artificial intelligence-assisted platform that combines large language models
with domain-specific heuristics to transform clinical data review. In a
controlled experimental study with experienced clinical reviewers (n=10), we
demonstrate that AI assistance increased data cleaning throughput by 6.03-fold
while simultaneously decreasing cleaning errors from 54.67% to 8.48% (a
6.44-fold improvement). Crucially, the system reduced false positive queries by
15.48-fold, minimizing unnecessary site burden. These improvements were
consistent across reviewers regardless of experience level, suggesting broad
applicability. Our findings indicate that AI-assisted approaches can address
fundamental inefficiencies in clinical trial operations, potentially
accelerating drug development timelines and reducing costs while maintaining
regulatory compliance. This work establishes a framework for integrating AI
into safety-critical clinical workflows and demonstrates the transformative
potential of human-AI collaboration in pharmaceutical clinical trials.

Conclusion: 提出的框架在结构剪枝中表现优异，解决了参数间相互联系被忽视的问题。

Abstract: Structural pruning has been widely studied for its effectiveness in
compressing neural networks. However, existing methods often neglect the
interconnections among parameters. To address this limitation, this paper
proposes a structural pruning framework termed Optimal Brain Connection. First,
we introduce the Jacobian Criterion, a first-order metric for evaluating the
saliency of structural parameters. Unlike existing first-order methods that
assess parameters in isolation, our criterion explicitly captures both
intra-component interactions and inter-layer dependencies. Second, we propose
the Equivalent Pruning mechanism, which utilizes autoencoders to retain the
contributions of all original connection--including pruned ones--during
fine-tuning. Experimental results demonstrate that the Jacobian Criterion
outperforms several popular metrics in preserving model performance, while the
Equivalent Pruning mechanism effectively mitigates performance degradation
after fine-tuning. Code: https://github.com/ShaowuChen/Optimal_Brain_Connection

Motivation: 生成式视频模型的普及使得检测AI生成和篡改视频成为迫切需求，现有方法因依赖单一信息且模型庞大而难以泛化。

Method: SSTGNN将视频表示为结构化图，结合可学习频谱滤波器和时序差分建模，有效捕捉篡改痕迹。

Conclusion: SSTGNN为轻量级、可扩展的视频篡改检测提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: The proliferation of generative video models has made detecting AI-generated
and manipulated videos an urgent challenge. Existing detection approaches often
fail to generalize across diverse manipulation types due to their reliance on
isolated spatial, temporal, or spectral information, and typically require
large models to perform well. This paper introduces SSTGNN, a lightweight
Spatial-Spectral-Temporal Graph Neural Network framework that represents videos
as structured graphs, enabling joint reasoning over spatial inconsistencies,
temporal artifacts, and spectral distortions. SSTGNN incorporates learnable
spectral filters and temporal differential modeling into a graph-based
architecture, capturing subtle manipulation traces more effectively. Extensive
experiments on diverse benchmark datasets demonstrate that SSTGNN not only
achieves superior performance in both in-domain and cross-domain settings, but
also offers strong robustness against unseen manipulations. Remarkably, SSTGNN
accomplishes these results with up to 42.4$\times$ fewer parameters than
state-of-the-art models, making it highly lightweight and scalable for
real-world deployment.

Abstract: As the volume of video content online grows exponentially, the demand for
moderation of unsafe videos has surpassed human capabilities, posing both
operational and mental health challenges. While recent studies demonstrated the
merits of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in various video
understanding tasks, their application to multimodal content moderation, a
domain that requires nuanced understanding of both visual and textual cues,
remains relatively underexplored. In this work, we benchmark the capabilities
of MLLMs in brand safety classification, a critical subset of content
moderation for safe-guarding advertising integrity. To this end, we introduce a
novel, multimodal and multilingual dataset, meticulously labeled by
professional reviewers in a multitude of risk categories. Through a detailed
comparative analysis, we demonstrate the effectiveness of MLLMs such as Gemini,
GPT, and Llama in multimodal brand safety, and evaluate their accuracy and cost
efficiency compared to professional human reviewers. Furthermore, we present an
in-depth discussion shedding light on limitations of MLLMs and failure cases.
We are releasing our dataset alongside this paper to facilitate future research
on effective and responsible brand safety and content moderation.

Motivation: 解决部分标注数据集中模糊动作和未标注动作的识别问题，适用于神经科学等领域。

Result: 在Breakfast、50Salads和Desktop Assembly三个数据集上，方法显著优于现有基线。

Conclusion: Action Discovery方法有效解决了部分标注数据中的动作识别问题，为相关领域提供了新思路。

Abstract: We introduce Action Discovery, a novel setup within Temporal Action
Segmentation that addresses the challenge of defining and annotating ambiguous
actions and incomplete annotations in partially labeled datasets. In this
setup, only a subset of actions - referred to as known actions - is annotated
in the training data, while other unknown actions remain unlabeled. This
scenario is particularly relevant in domains like neuroscience, where
well-defined behaviors (e.g., walking, eating) coexist with subtle or
infrequent actions that are often overlooked, as well as in applications where
datasets are inherently partially annotated due to ambiguous or missing labels.
To address this problem, we propose a two-step approach that leverages the
known annotations to guide both the temporal and semantic granularity of
unknown action segments. First, we introduce the Granularity-Guided
Segmentation Module (GGSM), which identifies temporal intervals for both known
and unknown actions by mimicking the granularity of annotated actions. Second,
we propose the Unknown Action Segment Assignment (UASA), which identifies
semantically meaningful classes within the unknown actions, based on learned
embedding similarities. We systematically explore the proposed setting of
Action Discovery on three challenging datasets - Breakfast, 50Salads, and
Desktop Assembly - demonstrating that our method considerably improves upon
existing baselines.

Conclusion: Follow-Your-Instruction作为一种可扩展且高效的数据引擎，具有推动生成智能发展的潜力。

Abstract: With the growing demands of AI-generated content (AIGC), the need for
high-quality, diverse, and scalable data has become increasingly crucial.
However, collecting large-scale real-world data remains costly and
time-consuming, hindering the development of downstream applications. While
some works attempt to collect task-specific data via a rendering process, most
approaches still rely on manual scene construction, limiting their scalability
and accuracy. To address these challenges, we propose Follow-Your-Instruction,
a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM)-driven framework for automatically
synthesizing high-quality 2D, 3D, and 4D data. Our
\textbf{Follow-Your-Instruction} first collects assets and their associated
descriptions through multimodal inputs using the MLLM-Collector. Then it
constructs 3D layouts, and leverages Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for semantic
refinement through multi-view scenes with the MLLM-Generator and
MLLM-Optimizer, respectively. Finally, it uses MLLM-Planner to generate
temporally coherent future frames. We evaluate the quality of the generated
data through comprehensive experiments on the 2D, 3D, and 4D generative tasks.
The results show that our synthetic data significantly boosts the performance
of existing baseline models, demonstrating Follow-Your-Instruction's potential
as a scalable and effective data engine for generative intelligence.

Motivation: 解决VLP模型在细粒度定位和类别依赖关系建模上的不足，提升开放词汇多标签识别效果。

Method: 提出DART框架，包含自适应细化模块（ARM）和自适应转移模块（ATM），利用LLM构建类别关系图。

Result: 在多个基准测试中达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: DART通过结合LLM知识和自适应模块，显著提升了开放词汇多标签识别的性能。

Abstract: Open-Vocabulary Multi-Label Recognition (OV-MLR) aims to identify multiple
seen and unseen object categories within an image, requiring both precise
intra-class localization to pinpoint objects and effective inter-class
reasoning to model complex category dependencies. While Vision-Language
Pre-training (VLP) models offer a strong open-vocabulary foundation, they often
struggle with fine-grained localization under weak supervision and typically
fail to explicitly leverage structured relational knowledge beyond basic
semantics, limiting performance especially for unseen classes. To overcome
these limitations, we propose the Dual Adaptive Refinement Transfer (DART)
framework. DART enhances a frozen VLP backbone via two synergistic adaptive
modules. For intra-class refinement, an Adaptive Refinement Module (ARM)
refines patch features adaptively, coupled with a novel Weakly Supervised Patch
Selecting (WPS) loss that enables discriminative localization using only
image-level labels. Concurrently, for inter-class transfer, an Adaptive
Transfer Module (ATM) leverages a Class Relationship Graph (CRG), constructed
using structured knowledge mined from a Large Language Model (LLM), and employs
graph attention network to adaptively transfer relational information between
class representations. DART is the first framework, to our knowledge, to
explicitly integrate external LLM-derived relational knowledge for adaptive
inter-class transfer while simultaneously performing adaptive intra-class
refinement under weak supervision for OV-MLR. Extensive experiments on
challenging benchmarks demonstrate that our DART achieves new state-of-the-art
performance, validating its effectiveness.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉分词器在压缩比和重建保真度之间难以平衡，WeTok旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 采用分组无查找量化（GQ）和生成解码（GD）技术，前者通过分组量化提升效率，后者通过概率建模增强细节重建。

Result: 在ImageNet 50k验证集上，WeTok实现了最低的零样本rFID（0.12），并在高压缩比下表现优异。

Conclusion: WeTok在视觉生成任务中表现卓越，尤其在压缩比和重建质量方面超越现有方法。

Abstract: Visual tokenizer is a critical component for vision generation. However, the
existing tokenizers often face unsatisfactory trade-off between compression
ratios and reconstruction fidelity. To fill this gap, we introduce a powerful
and concise WeTok tokenizer, which surpasses the previous leading tokenizers
via two core innovations. (1) Group-wise lookup-free Quantization (GQ). We
partition the latent features into groups, and perform lookup-free quantization
for each group. As a result, GQ can efficiently overcome memory and computation
limitations of prior tokenizers, while achieving a reconstruction breakthrough
with more scalable codebooks. (2) Generative Decoding (GD). Different from
prior tokenizers, we introduce a generative decoder with a prior of extra noise
variable. In this case, GD can probabilistically model the distribution of
visual data conditioned on discrete tokens, allowing WeTok to reconstruct
visual details, especially at high compression ratios. Extensive experiments on
mainstream benchmarks show superior performance of our WeTok. On the ImageNet
50k validation set, WeTok achieves a record-low zero-shot rFID (WeTok: 0.12 vs.
FLUX-VAE: 0.18 vs. SD-VAE 3.5: 0.19). Furthermore, our highest compression
model achieves a zero-shot rFID of 3.49 with a compression ratio of 768,
outperforming Cosmos (384) 4.57 which has only 50% compression rate of ours.

Result: 实验验证了该框架的有效性。

Conclusion: LLaVA-RE为二元图像-文本相关性评估提供了灵活且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal generative AI usually involves generating image or text responses
given inputs in another modality. The evaluation of image-text relevancy is
essential for measuring response quality or ranking candidate responses. In
particular, binary relevancy evaluation, i.e., ``Relevant'' vs. ``Not
Relevant'', is a fundamental problem. However, this is a challenging task
considering that texts have diverse formats and the definition of relevancy
varies in different scenarios. We find that Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) are an ideal choice to build such evaluators, as they can flexibly
handle complex text formats and take in additional task information. In this
paper, we present LLaVA-RE, a first attempt for binary image-text relevancy
evaluation with MLLM. It follows the LLaVA architecture and adopts detailed
task instructions and multimodal in-context samples. In addition, we propose a
novel binary relevancy data set that covers various tasks. Experimental results
validate the effectiveness of our framework.

Conclusion: Hi3DEval为3D生成内容提供了可扩展的评估方法，替代人工评估。

Abstract: Despite rapid advances in 3D content generation, quality assessment for the
generated 3D assets remains challenging. Existing methods mainly rely on
image-based metrics and operate solely at the object level, limiting their
ability to capture spatial coherence, material authenticity, and high-fidelity
local details. 1) To address these challenges, we introduce Hi3DEval, a
hierarchical evaluation framework tailored for 3D generative content. It
combines both object-level and part-level evaluation, enabling holistic
assessments across multiple dimensions as well as fine-grained quality
analysis. Additionally, we extend texture evaluation beyond aesthetic
appearance by explicitly assessing material realism, focusing on attributes
such as albedo, saturation, and metallicness. 2) To support this framework, we
construct Hi3DBench, a large-scale dataset comprising diverse 3D assets and
high-quality annotations, accompanied by a reliable multi-agent annotation
pipeline. We further propose a 3D-aware automated scoring system based on
hybrid 3D representations. Specifically, we leverage video-based
representations for object-level and material-subject evaluations to enhance
modeling of spatio-temporal consistency and employ pretrained 3D features for
part-level perception. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach
outperforms existing image-based metrics in modeling 3D characteristics and
achieves superior alignment with human preference, providing a scalable
alternative to manual evaluations. The project page is available at

TL;DR: MOSEv2是一个更复杂的视频对象分割数据集，旨在推动真实场景下的研究，包含更多挑战性场景和对象，导致现有方法性能显著下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频对象分割（VOS）数据集主要包含显著、主导和孤立的对象，限制了其在真实场景中的泛化能力。MOSEv2旨在填补这一空白，提供更复杂的场景。

Method: MOSEv2包含5,024个视频和701,976个高质量掩码，涵盖200个类别的10,074个对象，引入了更多复杂场景和挑战。

Result: 在MOSEv2上，20种代表性VOS方法的性能显著下降（如SAM2从76.4%降至50.9%），视频对象跟踪方法也表现类似。

Conclusion: MOSEv2揭示了当前VOS方法在真实复杂场景中的局限性，为未来研究提供了更具挑战性的基准。

Abstract: Video object segmentation (VOS) aims to segment specified target objects
throughout a video. Although state-of-the-art methods have achieved impressive
performance (e.g., 90+% J&F) on existing benchmarks such as DAVIS and
YouTube-VOS, these datasets primarily contain salient, dominant, and isolated
objects, limiting their generalization to real-world scenarios. To advance VOS
toward more realistic environments, coMplex video Object SEgmentation (MOSEv1)
was introduced to facilitate VOS research in complex scenes. Building on the
strengths and limitations of MOSEv1, we present MOSEv2, a significantly more
challenging dataset designed to further advance VOS methods under real-world
conditions. MOSEv2 consists of 5,024 videos and over 701,976 high-quality masks
for 10,074 objects across 200 categories. Compared to its predecessor, MOSEv2
introduces significantly greater scene complexity, including more frequent
object disappearance and reappearance, severe occlusions and crowding, smaller
objects, as well as a range of new challenges such as adverse weather (e.g.,
rain, snow, fog), low-light scenes (e.g., nighttime, underwater), multi-shot
sequences, camouflaged objects, non-physical targets (e.g., shadows,
reflections), scenarios requiring external knowledge, etc. We benchmark 20
representative VOS methods under 5 different settings and observe consistent
performance drops. For example, SAM2 drops from 76.4% on MOSEv1 to only 50.9%
on MOSEv2. We further evaluate 9 video object tracking methods and find similar
declines, demonstrating that MOSEv2 presents challenges across tasks. These
results highlight that despite high accuracy on existing datasets, current VOS
methods still struggle under real-world complexities. MOSEv2 is publicly

*Weiqi Zhang,Junsheng Zhou,Haotian Geng,Wenyuan Zhang,Yu-Shen Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GAP是一种新方法，通过文本引导将原始点云转化为高保真3D高斯分布，解决了无色点云直接生成高斯的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 点云是广泛使用的3D表示形式，但如何从无色点云生成高斯分布仍是一个未解决的难题。

Method: GAP采用多视角优化框架，结合深度感知图像扩散模型和表面锚定机制，确保几何准确性，并使用基于扩散的修复策略完成难观测区域。

Result: GAP在从合成点云到真实扫描的不同复杂度任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: GAP为点云到高斯的生成任务提供了一种高效且高质量的解决方案。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated its advantages in achieving
fast and high-quality rendering. As point clouds serve as a widely-used and
easily accessible form of 3D representation, bridging the gap between point
clouds and Gaussians becomes increasingly important. Recent studies have
explored how to convert the colored points into Gaussians, but directly
generating Gaussians from colorless 3D point clouds remains an unsolved
challenge. In this paper, we propose GAP, a novel approach that gaussianizes
raw point clouds into high-fidelity 3D Gaussians with text guidance. Our key
idea is to design a multi-view optimization framework that leverages a
depth-aware image diffusion model to synthesize consistent appearances across
different viewpoints. To ensure geometric accuracy, we introduce a
surface-anchoring mechanism that effectively constrains Gaussians to lie on the
surfaces of 3D shapes during optimization. Furthermore, GAP incorporates a
diffuse-based inpainting strategy that specifically targets at completing
hard-to-observe regions. We evaluate GAP on the Point-to-Gaussian generation
task across varying complexity levels, from synthetic point clouds to
challenging real-world scans, and even large-scale scenes. Project Page:

*Mohammed Talha Alam,Fahad Shamshad,Fakhri Karray,Karthik Nandakumar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FaceAnonyMixer是一种可撤销的人脸生成框架，通过混合真实人脸图像的潜在代码与可撤销密钥生成的合成代码，生成隐私保护的人脸图像，同时满足生物识别模板保护的要求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的人脸匿名化方法通常只关注隐藏身份，但未能满足生物识别模板保护的要求（如可撤销性、不可链接性和不可逆性）。

Method: 利用预训练生成模型的潜在空间，将真实人脸图像的潜在代码与可撤销密钥生成的合成代码混合，并通过多目标损失函数优化，生成高质量的可撤销人脸图像。

Result: 在基准数据集上的实验表明，FaceAnonyMixer在保持高识别精度的同时，提供了更强的隐私保护，商业API上比现有方法提升了11%以上。

Conclusion: FaceAnonyMixer是一种高效的人脸匿名化方法，能够同时满足隐私保护和识别精度的需求。

Abstract: Advancements in face recognition (FR) technologies have amplified privacy
concerns, necessitating methods that protect identity while maintaining
recognition utility. Existing face anonymization methods typically focus on
obscuring identity but fail to meet the requirements of biometric template
protection, including revocability, unlinkability, and irreversibility. We
propose FaceAnonyMixer, a cancelable face generation framework that leverages
the latent space of a pre-trained generative model to synthesize
privacy-preserving face images. The core idea of FaceAnonyMixer is to
irreversibly mix the latent code of a real face image with a synthetic code
derived from a revocable key. The mixed latent code is further refined through
a carefully designed multi-objective loss to satisfy all cancelable biometric
requirements. FaceAnonyMixer is capable of generating high-quality cancelable
faces that can be directly matched using existing FR systems without requiring
any modifications. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that
FaceAnonyMixer delivers superior recognition accuracy while providing
significantly stronger privacy protection, achieving over an 11% gain on
commercial API compared to recent cancelable biometric methods. Code is

### [102] [Enhancing Dialogue Annotation with Speaker Characteristics Leveraging a Frozen LLM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04795)
*Thomas Thebaud,Yen-Ju Lu,Matthew Wiesner,Peter Viechnicki,Najim Dehak*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种在对话转录后处理中添加说话者特征元数据的方法，结合音频基础模型和语言模型，无需微调即可实现高效性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索如何在对话转录后处理中进一步丰富内容，通过添加说话者特征（如年龄、性别、情感）的元数据，提升转录的实用性和可读性。

Method: 结合冻结的音频基础模型（如Whisper或WavLM）和冻结的LLAMA语言模型，通过轻量级连接器桥接音频和语言表示，推断说话者属性。

Result: 在说话者分析任务中表现优异，同时保持模块化和速度；冻结的LLAMA模型在某些场景下直接比较x-向量，实现了8.8%的等错误率。

Conclusion: 该方法为对话转录后处理提供了新的元数据丰富途径，展示了冻结模型在跨模态任务中的潜力。

Abstract: In dialogue transcription pipelines, Large Language Models (LLMs) are
frequently employed in post-processing to improve grammar, punctuation, and
readability. We explore a complementary post-processing step: enriching
transcribed dialogues by adding metadata tags for speaker characteristics such
as age, gender, and emotion. Some of the tags are global to the entire
dialogue, while some are time-variant. Our approach couples frozen audio
foundation models, such as Whisper or WavLM, with a frozen LLAMA language model
to infer these speaker attributes, without requiring task-specific fine-tuning
of either model. Using lightweight, efficient connectors to bridge audio and
language representations, we achieve competitive performance on speaker
profiling tasks while preserving modularity and speed. Additionally, we
demonstrate that a frozen LLAMA model can compare x-vectors directly, achieving
an Equal Error Rate of 8.8% in some scenarios.

*Negar Foroutan,Clara Meister,Debjit Paul,Joel Niklaus,Sina Ahmadi,Antoine Bosselut,Rico Sennrich*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种改进的BPE算法（Parity-aware BPE），旨在解决传统BPE算法对低资源语言的不公平问题，通过优化压缩增益实现跨语言公平性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统BPE算法基于频率目标，导致低资源语言的tokenization效果差，加剧了语言间的计算和财务不平等。

Method: 提出Parity-aware BPE算法，在每一步合并时优先优化当前压缩效果最差的语言的压缩增益。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著改善了跨语言的token数量公平性，且对全局压缩率和下游任务性能影响极小。

Conclusion: Parity-aware BPE是一种有效的改进方法，能够在不牺牲性能的前提下提升低资源语言的tokenization公平性。

Abstract: Tokenization is the first -- and often least scrutinized -- step of most NLP
pipelines. Standard algorithms for learning tokenizers rely on frequency-based
objectives, which favor languages dominant in the training data and
consequently leave lower-resource languages with tokenizations that are
disproportionately longer, morphologically implausible, or even riddled with
<UNK> placeholders. This phenomenon ultimately amplifies computational and
financial inequalities between users from different language backgrounds. To
remedy this, we introduce Parity-aware Byte Pair Encoding (BPE), a variant of
the widely-used BPE algorithm. At every merge step, Parity-aware BPE maximizes
the compression gain of the currently worst-compressed language, trading a
small amount of global compression for cross-lingual parity. We find
empirically that Parity-aware BPE leads to more equitable token counts across
languages, with negligible impact on global compression rate and no substantial
effect on language-model performance in downstream tasks.

Motivation: 探索如何通过音高重音检测模块提升ASR系统的性能，并验证保留或重新学习重要韵律线索（如音高重音）的价值。

Method: 提出联合ASR和音高重音检测模型，结合半监督语音表示进行训练。

Result: 音高重音检测F1分数提升41%，ASR在LibriSpeech上的WER降低28.3%。

Conclusion: 联合模型显著提升性能，证明了韵律线索在ASR中的重要性。

Abstract: We show the performance of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems that

pitch accent detection module, by introducing a joint ASR and pitch accent
detection model. The pitch accent detection component of our model achieves a
significant improvement on the state-of-the-art for the task, closing the gap
in F1-score by 41%. Additionally, the ASR performance in joint training
decreases WER by 28.3% on LibriSpeech, under limited resource fine-tuning. With
these results, we show the importance of extending pretrained speech models to

TL;DR: PERSIST框架评估了25+开源大语言模型的行为稳定性，发现即使是400B+参数的模型也存在显著响应变异性，提示当前LLM缺乏行为一致性基础。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大语言模型的行为稳定性，以评估其安全部署的可行性。

Method: 使用BFI-44、SD3等传统及LLM适配的人格测评工具，系统测试模型在不同条件下的响应。

Result: 发现模型响应变异性高，干预措施可能加剧不稳定性，LLM适配工具与传统工具表现相似。

Conclusion: 当前LLM缺乏行为一致性基础，人格对齐策略可能不足以支持安全关键应用。

Abstract: Large language models require consistent behavioral patterns for safe
deployment, yet their personality-like traits remain poorly understood. We
present PERSIST (PERsonality Stability in Synthetic Text), a comprehensive
evaluation framework testing 25+ open-source models (1B-671B parameters) across
500,000+ responses. Using traditional (BFI-44, SD3) and novel LLM-adapted
personality instruments, we systematically vary question order, paraphrasing,
personas, and reasoning modes. Our findings challenge fundamental deployment
assumptions: (1) Even 400B+ models exhibit substantial response variability (SD
> 0.4); (2) Minor prompt reordering alone shifts personality measurements by up
to 20%; (3) Interventions expected to stabilize behavior, such as
chain-of-thought reasoning, detailed personas instruction, inclusion of
conversation history, can paradoxically increase variability; (4) LLM-adapted
instruments show equal instability to human-centric versions, confirming
architectural rather than translational limitations. This persistent
instability across scales and mitigation strategies suggests current LLMs lack
the foundations for genuine behavioral consistency. For safety-critical
applications requiring predictable behavior, these findings indicate that
personality-based alignment strategies may be fundamentally inadequate.

TL;DR: RCR-Router是一个模块化、角色感知的上下文路由框架，用于多代理LLM系统，通过动态选择语义相关内存子集，减少令牌使用并提高效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有协调方案依赖静态或全上下文路由策略，导致令牌消耗过多、内存冗余和适应性差。

Method: 引入轻量级评分策略动态选择内存子集，迭代整合代理输出到共享内存中。

Result: 在三个多跳QA基准测试中，RCR-Router减少令牌使用（高达30%）并保持或提高答案质量。

Conclusion: 结构化内存路由和输出感知评估对可扩展多代理LLM系统至关重要。

Abstract: Multi-agent large language model (LLM) systems have shown strong potential in
complex reasoning and collaborative decision-making tasks. However, most
existing coordination schemes rely on static or full-context routing
strategies, which lead to excessive token consumption, redundant memory
exposure, and limited adaptability across interaction rounds. We introduce
RCR-Router, a modular and role-aware context routing framework designed to
enable efficient, adaptive collaboration in multi-agent LLMs. To our knowledge,
this is the first routing approach that dynamically selects semantically
relevant memory subsets for each agent based on its role and task stage, while
adhering to a strict token budget. A lightweight scoring policy guides memory
selection, and agent outputs are iteratively integrated into a shared memory
store to facilitate progressive context refinement. To better evaluate model
behavior, we further propose an Answer Quality Score metric that captures
LLM-generated explanations beyond standard QA accuracy. Experiments on three
multi-hop QA benchmarks -- HotPotQA, MuSiQue, and 2WikiMultihop -- demonstrate
that RCR-Router reduces token usage (up to 30%) while improving or maintaining
answer quality. These results highlight the importance of structured memory
routing and output-aware evaluation in advancing scalable multi-agent LLM
systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种评估大型语言模型（LLMs）对语言标记（如性别、社会阶层或地域背景）反应的基准，揭示了模型对某些语言模式（如模糊表达）的系统性偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是检测和量化LLMs中的语言歧视，特别是在自动评估系统中对不同语言模式的偏见。

Method: 通过100个验证过的问题-回答对构建的模拟访谈，生成语义等效但语言变异的回答，以精确测量偏见。

Result: 结果显示，模糊表达的回答平均评分低25.6%，验证了基准在识别模型特定偏见上的有效性。

Conclusion: 该研究为检测和测量AI系统中的语言歧视提供了基础框架，对自动决策中的公平性有广泛应用。

Abstract: This paper introduces a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating how Large
Language Models (LLMs) respond to linguistic shibboleths: subtle linguistic
markers that can inadvertently reveal demographic attributes such as gender,
social class, or regional background. Through carefully constructed interview
simulations using 100 validated question-response pairs, we demonstrate how
LLMs systematically penalize certain linguistic patterns, particularly hedging
language, despite equivalent content quality. Our benchmark generates
controlled linguistic variations that isolate specific phenomena while
maintaining semantic equivalence, which enables the precise measurement of
demographic bias in automated evaluation systems. We validate our approach
along multiple linguistic dimensions, showing that hedged responses receive
25.6% lower ratings on average, and demonstrate the benchmark's effectiveness
in identifying model-specific biases. This work establishes a foundational
framework for detecting and measuring linguistic discrimination in AI systems,
with broad applications to fairness in automated decision-making contexts.

*Louie Hong Yao,Nicholas Jarvis,Tianyu Jiang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于视觉语言聚类的框架，用于更全面地评估视觉活动识别系统，解决了动词语义和图像解释的模糊性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于动词语义和图像解释的模糊性，标准精确匹配评估方法无法全面评估模型性能。

Method: 提出了一种视觉语言聚类框架，构建动词意义簇，用于更稳健的评估。

Result: 在imSitu数据集上，每张图像平均映射到2.8个意义簇，每个簇代表图像的不同视角。聚类评估与人类判断更一致。

Conclusion: 聚类评估方法比标准评估方法更能反映模型性能，提供了更细致的评估。

Abstract: Evaluating visual activity recognition systems is challenging due to inherent
ambiguities in verb semantics and image interpretation. When describing actions
in images, synonymous verbs can refer to the same event (e.g., brushing vs.
grooming), while different perspectives can lead to equally valid but distinct
verb choices (e.g., piloting vs. operating). Standard exact-match evaluation,
which relies on a single gold answer, fails to capture these ambiguities,
resulting in an incomplete assessment of model performance. To address this, we
propose a vision-language clustering framework that constructs verb sense
clusters, providing a more robust evaluation. Our analysis of the imSitu
dataset shows that each image maps to an average of 2.8 sense clusters, with
each cluster representing a distinct perspective of the image. We evaluate
multiple activity recognition models and compare our cluster-based evaluation
with standard evaluation methods. Additionally, our human alignment analysis
suggests that the cluster-based evaluation better aligns with human judgements,
offering a more nuanced assessment of model performance.

TL;DR: 提出了一种多阶段大语言模型框架，用于从非结构化文本中提取社会健康决定因素（SDoH），提升自杀相关因素的提取准确性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决自杀事件中SDoH因素提取的挑战，如长尾分布、关键压力源分析和模型可解释性不足。

Method: 采用多阶段大语言模型框架，对比BioBERT、GPT-3.5-turbo和DeepSeek-R1，并通过用户研究评估模型解释效果。

Result: 框架在SDoH因素提取和相关上下文检索任务中表现优异，且小规模任务专用模型在降低推理成本的同时性能相当。

Conclusion: 该方法提升了从非结构化文本中提取自杀相关SDoH的准确性和透明度，有助于早期风险识别和预防策略制定。

Abstract: Background: Understanding social determinants of health (SDoH) factors
contributing to suicide incidents is crucial for early intervention and
prevention. However, data-driven approaches to this goal face challenges such
as long-tailed factor distributions, analyzing pivotal stressors preceding
suicide incidents, and limited model explainability. Methods: We present a
multi-stage large language model framework to enhance SDoH factor extraction
from unstructured text. Our approach was compared to other state-of-the-art
language models (i.e., pre-trained BioBERT and GPT-3.5-turbo) and reasoning
models (i.e., DeepSeek-R1). We also evaluated how the model's explanations help
people annotate SDoH factors more quickly and accurately. The analysis included
both automated comparisons and a pilot user study. Results: We show that our
proposed framework demonstrated performance boosts in the overarching task of
extracting SDoH factors and in the finer-grained tasks of retrieving relevant
context. Additionally, we show that fine-tuning a smaller, task-specific model
achieves comparable or better performance with reduced inference costs. The
multi-stage design not only enhances extraction but also provides intermediate
explanations, improving model explainability. Conclusions: Our approach
improves both the accuracy and transparency of extracting suicide-related SDoH
from unstructured texts. These advancements have the potential to support early
identification of individuals at risk and inform more effective prevention
strategies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法假设情感元素均匀分布，而实际对话中存在多个语义独立的子对话，跨对话学习会引入噪声。

Method: 利用结构熵最小化算法分割对话为语义独立的子对话，并采用两步框架（先提取情感元素，后匹配四元组）。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在DiaASQ任务中达到最先进性能，且计算成本更低。

Conclusion: 通过语义分割和两步提取框架，有效解决了噪声问题并提升了四元组提取的效率和准确性。

Abstract: Dialogues Aspect-based Sentiment Quadruple Extraction (DiaASQ) aims to
extract all target-aspect-opinion-sentiment quadruples from a given
multi-round, multi-participant dialogue. Existing methods typically learn word
relations across entire dialogues, assuming a uniform distribution of sentiment
elements. However, we find that dialogues often contain multiple semantically
independent sub-dialogues without clear dependencies between them. Therefore,
learning word relationships across the entire dialogue inevitably introduces
additional noise into the extraction process. To address this, our method
focuses on partitioning dialogues into semantically independent sub-dialogues.
Achieving completeness while minimizing these sub-dialogues presents a
significant challenge. Simply partitioning based on reply relationships is
ineffective. Instead, we propose utilizing a structural entropy minimization
algorithm to partition the dialogues. This approach aims to preserve relevant
utterances while distinguishing irrelevant ones as much as possible.
Furthermore, we introduce a two-step framework for quadruple extraction: first
extracting individual sentiment elements at the utterance level, then matching
quadruples at the sub-dialogue level. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in DiaASQ with much lower
computational costs.

Abstract: Meaning Representation (AMR) is a semantic formalism that encodes sentence

straightfoward finetuning of decoder only LLMs can achieve comparable
performance to complex State of the Art (SOTA) AMR parsers. Notably, LLaMA 3.2
demonstrates competitive performance against SOTA AMR parsers given a
straightforward finetuning approach. We achieved SMATCH F1: 0.804 on the full
LDC2020T02 test split, on par with APT + Silver (IBM) at 0.804 and approaching
Graphene Smatch (MBSE) at 0.854. Across our analysis, we also observed a
consistent pattern where LLaMA 3.2 leads in semantic performance while Phi 3.5

Motivation: 多任务学习（MTL）中，现有方法倾向于使用多适配器或多头结构以捕获任务特定知识，但论文发现这种复杂结构并非必要，甚至可能影响性能。

Method: 提出Align-LoRA，通过增加单适配器LoRA的秩并引入显式损失函数以对齐任务表示，简化了多任务学习的架构。

Result: 实验表明，Align-LoRA显著优于现有基线，验证了学习共享表示而非隔离任务特征的重要性。

Conclusion: 论文确立了更简单有效的LLM多任务适应范式，强调共享表示对泛化的关键作用。

Abstract: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) is essential for adapting Large
Language Models (LLMs). In practice, LLMs are often required to handle a
diverse set of tasks from multiple domains, a scenario naturally addressed by
multi-task learning (MTL). Within this MTL context, a prevailing trend involves
LoRA variants with multiple adapters or heads, which advocate for structural
diversity to capture task-specific knowledge. Our findings present a direct
challenge to this paradigm. We first show that a simplified multi-head
architecture with high inter-head similarity substantially outperforms complex
multi-adapter and multi-head systems. This leads us to question the
multi-component paradigm itself, and we further demonstrate that a standard
single-adapter LoRA, with a sufficiently increased rank, also achieves highly
competitive performance. These results lead us to a new hypothesis: effective
MTL generalization hinges on learning robust shared representations, not
isolating task-specific features. To validate this, we propose Align-LoRA,
which incorporates an explicit loss to align task representations within the
shared adapter space. Experiments confirm that Align-LoRA significantly
surpasses all baselines, establishing a simpler yet more effective paradigm for
adapting LLMs to multiple tasks. The code is available at

Conclusion: 多模态推理的有效性为复杂现实场景中的可扩展和可解释事实核查提供了潜力。

Abstract: The growing rate of multimodal misinformation, where claims are supported by
both text and images, poses significant challenges to fact-checking systems
that rely primarily on textual evidence. In this work, we have proposed a
unified framework for fine-grained multimodal fact verification called
"MultiCheck", designed to reason over structured textual and visual signals.
Our architecture combines dedicated encoders for text and images with a fusion
module that captures cross-modal relationships using element-wise interactions.
A classification head then predicts the veracity of a claim, supported by a
contrastive learning objective that encourages semantic alignment between
claim-evidence pairs in a shared latent space. We evaluate our approach on the
Factify 2 dataset, achieving a weighted F1 score of 0.84, substantially
outperforming the baseline. These results highlight the effectiveness of
explicit multimodal reasoning and demonstrate the potential of our approach for
scalable and interpretable fact-checking in complex, real-world scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）的知识局限性需要通过检索增强生成（RAG）补充，但长检索上下文会导致熵增长和注意力稀释，影响性能。

Method: 提出BEE-RAG框架，利用平衡上下文熵重新定义注意力动态，分离注意力敏感性与上下文长度，保持熵稳定。引入零样本推理策略和多重要性估计，以及参数高效的自适应微调机制。

Result: 在多个RAG任务上的实验证明了BEE-RAG的有效性。

Conclusion: BEE-RAG通过熵工程优化RAG性能，解决了长上下文带来的问题，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs),
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has emerged as a critical approach to
supplement the inherent knowledge limitations of LLMs. However, due to the
typically large volume of retrieved information, RAG tends to operate with long
context lengths. From the perspective of entropy engineering, we identify
unconstrained entropy growth and attention dilution due to long retrieval
context as significant factors affecting RAG performance. In this paper, we
propose the balanced entropy-engineered RAG (BEE-RAG) framework, which improves
the adaptability of RAG systems to varying context lengths through the
principle of entropy invariance. By leveraging balanced context entropy to
reformulate attention dynamics, BEE-RAG separates attention sensitivity from
context length, ensuring a stable entropy level. Building upon this, we

TL;DR: 论文研究了大型语言模型（LLMs）对输入信息位置敏感的现象，提出了一种名为AttnRank的无训练、即插即用的方法，通过重排输入内容以优化模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究LLMs对输入信息位置敏感的原因，并找到一种无需修改模型参数或训练的方法来提升性能。

Method: 提出Attention-Driven Reranking（AttnRank）框架，通过校准集估计模型的注意力偏好，并重排输入内容以匹配高注意力位置。

Result: 在多项任务中，AttnRank显著提升了10种不同架构和规模的LLMs的性能。

Conclusion: AttnRank是一种高效且通用的方法，能够在不改变模型结构或训练过程的情况下优化LLMs的性能。

Abstract: The performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) is significantly sensitive to
the contextual position of information in the input. To investigate the
mechanism behind this positional bias, our extensive experiments reveal a
consistent phenomenon we term the attention basin: when presented with a
sequence of structured items (e.g., retrieved documents or few-shot examples),
models systematically assign higher attention to the items at the beginning and
end of the sequence, while neglecting those in the middle. Crucially, our
analysis further reveals that allocating higher attention to critical
information is key to enhancing model performance. Based on these insights, we
introduce Attention-Driven Reranking (AttnRank), a two-stage framework that (i)
estimates a model's intrinsic positional attention preferences using a small
calibration set, and (ii) reorders retrieved documents or few-shot examples to
align the most salient content with these high-attention positions. AttnRank is
a model-agnostic, training-free, and plug-and-play method with minimal
computational overhead. Experiments on multi-hop QA and few-shot in-context
learning tasks demonstrate that AttnRank achieves substantial improvements
across 10 large language models of varying architectures and scales, without
modifying model parameters or training procedures.

Motivation: 当前基准测试常忽视大语言模型在医疗伦理推理方面的评估，因此需要开发一个系统性工具来填补这一空白。

Method: 基于Principlism理论，构建了一个包含选择题和开放式问题的数据集，所有问题均经过医学专家验证。

Result: 实验显示，模型在伦理知识与应用间存在差距，尤其在动态应用伦理原则时表现不佳。前沿闭源模型表现最佳，但医疗领域微调可提升伦理能力。

Conclusion: PrinciplismQA为诊断模型伦理弱点提供了可扩展框架，有助于推动更平衡、负责任的医疗AI发展。

Abstract: The integration of large language models into healthcare necessitates a
rigorous evaluation of their ethical reasoning, an area current benchmarks
often overlook. We introduce PrinciplismQA, a comprehensive benchmark with
3,648 questions designed to systematically assess LLMs' alignment with core
medical ethics. Grounded in Principlism, our benchmark features a high-quality
dataset. This includes multiple-choice questions curated from authoritative
textbooks and open-ended questions sourced from authoritative medical ethics
case study literature, all validated by medical experts. Our experiments reveal
a significant gap between models' ethical knowledge and their practical
application, especially in dynamically applying ethical principles to
real-world scenarios. Most LLMs struggle with dilemmas concerning Beneficence,
often over-emphasizing other principles. Frontier closed-source models, driven
by strong general capabilities, currently lead the benchmark. Notably, medical
domain fine-tuning can enhance models' overall ethical competence, but further
progress requires better alignment with medical ethical knowledge.
PrinciplismQA offers a scalable framework to diagnose these specific ethical
weaknesses, paving the way for more balanced and responsible medical AI.

Motivation: 当前多模态情感分析（MSA）主要依赖参数庞大的多模态大语言模型（MLLMs），忽视了资源受限环境下的自主推理需求，因此需要轻量级解决方案。

Method: 采用“教师-助理-学生”蒸馏范式：先用高性能MLLM生成初始推理数据集，训练中等规模的助理模型，再联合训练轻量级学生模型进行推理和分类。

Result: 在四个数据集上的实验表明，MulCoT-RD仅需3B参数即可在JMSRC任务上表现优异，且具有强泛化能力和可解释性。

Conclusion: MulCoT-RD为资源受限环境提供了一种高效的多模态情感推理和分类解决方案，兼具性能和轻量化。

Abstract: The surge in rich multimodal content on social media platforms has greatly
advanced Multimodal Sentiment Analysis (MSA), with Large Language Models (LLMs)
further accelerating progress in this field. Current approaches primarily
leverage the knowledge and reasoning capabilities of parameter-heavy
(Multimodal) LLMs for sentiment classification, overlooking autonomous
multimodal sentiment reasoning generation in resource-constrained environments.
Therefore, we focus on the Resource-Limited Joint Multimodal Sentiment
Reasoning and Classification task, JMSRC, which simultaneously performs
multimodal sentiment reasoning chain generation and sentiment classification
only with a lightweight model. We propose a Multimodal Chain-of-Thought
Reasoning Distillation model, MulCoT-RD, designed for JMSRC that employs a
"Teacher-Assistant-Student" distillation paradigm to address deployment
constraints in resource-limited environments. We first leverage a
high-performance Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) to generate the initial
reasoning dataset and train a medium-sized assistant model with a multi-task
learning mechanism. A lightweight student model is jointly trained to perform
efficient multimodal sentiment reasoning generation and classification.
Extensive experiments on four datasets demonstrate that MulCoT-RD with only 3B
parameters achieves strong performance on JMSRC, while exhibiting robust
generalization and enhanced interpretability.

Abstract: Structured pruning is one of the representative techniques for compressing
large language models (LLMs) to reduce GPU memory consumption and accelerate
inference speed. It offers significant practical value in improving the
efficiency of LLMs in real-world applications. Current structured pruning
methods typically rely on assessment of the importance of the structure units
and pruning the units with less importance. Most of them overlooks the
interaction and collaboration among artificial neurons that are crucial for the
functionalities of LLMs, leading to a disruption in the macro functional
architecture of LLMs and consequently a pruning performance degradation.
Inspired by the inherent similarities between artificial neural networks and
functional neural networks in the human brain, we alleviate this challenge and
propose to prune LLMs by identifying and preserving functional networks within
LLMs in this study. To achieve this, we treat an LLM as a digital brain and
decompose the LLM into functional networks, analogous to identifying functional
brain networks in neuroimaging data. Afterwards, an LLM is pruned by preserving
the key neurons within these functional networks. Experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed method can successfully identify and locate
functional networks and key neurons in LLMs, enabling efficient model pruning.

Result: 实验表明，CodeBoost在多代码LLM和基准测试中均能提升性能。

Conclusion: CodeBoost是一种可扩展且高效的训练框架，适用于代码LLM的后训练。

Abstract: Code large language models (LLMs) have become indispensable tools for
building efficient and automated coding pipelines. Existing models are
typically post-trained using reinforcement learning (RL) from general-purpose
LLMs using "human instruction-final answer" pairs, where the instructions are
usually from manual annotations. However, collecting high-quality coding
instructions is both labor-intensive and difficult to scale. On the other hand,
code snippets are abundantly available from various sources. This imbalance
presents a major bottleneck in instruction-based post-training. We propose
CodeBoost, a post-training framework that enhances code LLMs purely from code
snippets, without relying on human-annotated instructions. CodeBoost introduces
the following key components: (1) maximum-clique curation, which selects a
representative and diverse training corpus from code; (2) bi-directional
prediction, which enables the model to learn from both forward and backward
prediction objectives; (3) error-aware prediction, which incorporates learning
signals from both correct and incorrect outputs; (4) heterogeneous
augmentation, which diversifies the training distribution to enrich code
semantics; and (5) heterogeneous rewarding, which guides model learning through
multiple reward types including format correctness and execution feedback from
both successes and failures. Extensive experiments across several code LLMs and
benchmarks verify that CodeBoost consistently improves performance,
demonstrating its effectiveness as a scalable and effective training pipeline.

Motivation: 研究大型语言模型（LLM）推理链中错误的实际影响，尤其是对早期错误更严重的假设提出质疑。

Method: 提出ASCoT方法，包括自适应验证管理器（AVM）和多视角自校正引擎（MSCE），通过位置权重和双路径校正解决晚期脆弱性。

Result: 实验表明ASCoT在GSM8K和MATH基准上表现优异，优于标准CoT。

Conclusion: 强调诊断LLM推理失败模式的重要性，提倡转向自适应、针对性校正机制。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has significantly advanced the reasoning
capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), yet the reliability of these
reasoning chains remains a critical challenge. A widely held "cascading
failure" hypothesis suggests that errors are most detrimental when they occur
early in the reasoning process. This paper challenges that assumption through
systematic error-injection experiments, revealing a counter-intuitive
phenomenon we term "Late-Stage Fragility": errors introduced in the later
stages of a CoT chain are significantly more likely to corrupt the final answer
than identical errors made at the beginning. To address this specific
vulnerability, we introduce the Adaptive Self-Correction Chain-of-Thought
(ASCoT) method. ASCoT employs a modular pipeline in which an Adaptive
Verification Manager (AVM) operates first, followed by the Multi-Perspective
Self-Correction Engine (MSCE). The AVM leverages a Positional Impact Score
function I(k) that assigns different weights based on the position within the
reasoning chains, addressing the Late-Stage Fragility issue by identifying and
prioritizing high-risk, late-stage steps. Once these critical steps are
identified, the MSCE applies robust, dual-path correction specifically to the
failure parts. Extensive experiments on benchmarks such as GSM8K and MATH
demonstrate that ASCoT achieves outstanding accuracy, outperforming strong
baselines, including standard CoT. Our work underscores the importance of
diagnosing specific failure modes in LLM reasoning and advocates for a shift
from uniform verification strategies to adaptive, vulnerability-aware
correction mechanisms.

Abstract: Meta-reviewing is a pivotal stage in the peer-review process, serving as the
final step in determining whether a paper is recommended for acceptance. Prior
research on meta-reviewing has treated this as a summarization problem over
review reports. However, complementary to this perspective, meta-reviewing is a
decision-making process that requires weighing reviewer arguments and placing
them within a broader context. Prior research has demonstrated that
decision-makers can be effectively assisted in such scenarios via dialogue
agents. In line with this framing, we explore the practical challenges for
realizing dialog agents that can effectively assist meta-reviewers. Concretely,
we first address the issue of data scarcity for training dialogue agents by
generating synthetic data using Large Language Models (LLMs) based on a
self-refinement strategy to improve the relevance of these dialogues to expert
domains. Our experiments demonstrate that this method produces higher-quality
synthetic data and can serve as a valuable resource towards training
meta-reviewing assistants. Subsequently, we utilize this data to train dialogue
agents tailored for meta-reviewing and find that these agents outperform
\emph{off-the-shelf} LLM-based assistants for this task. Finally, we apply our
agents in real-world meta-reviewing scenarios and confirm their effectiveness
in enhancing the efficiency of meta-reviewing.\footnote{Code and Data:

Abstract: The recently proposed Large Concept Model (LCM) generates text by predicting
a sequence of sentence-level embeddings and training with either mean-squared
error or diffusion objectives. We present SONAR-LLM, a decoder-only transformer
that "thinks" in the same continuous SONAR embedding space, yet is supervised
through token-level cross-entropy propagated via the frozen SONAR decoder. This
hybrid objective retains the semantic abstraction of LCM while eliminating its
diffusion sampler and restoring a likelihood-based training signal. Across
model sizes from 39M to 1.3B parameters, SONAR-LLM attains competitive
generation quality. We report scaling trends, ablations, benchmark results, and
release the complete training code and all pretrained checkpoints to foster
reproducibility and future research.

Motivation: 解决大语言模型在长链推理中因过度反思导致的token浪费和推理成本增加问题。

Method: CGRS通过动态抑制高置信度时的反思触发词，避免冗余推理步骤。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，CGRS平均减少18.5%至41.9%的token使用，同时保持准确性。

Conclusion: CGRS是一种无需训练或架构修改的高效推理方法，适用于不同规模和架构的模型。

Abstract: Recent Large Reasoning Language Models (LRLMs) employ long chain-of-thought
reasoning with complex reflection behaviors, typically signaled by specific
trigger words (e.g., "Wait" and "Alternatively") to enhance performance.
However, these reflection behaviors can lead to the overthinking problem where
the generation of redundant reasoning steps that unnecessarily increase token
usage, raise inference costs, and reduce practical utility. In this paper, we
propose Certainty-Guided Reflection Suppression (CGRS), a novel method that
mitigates overthinking in LRLMs while maintaining reasoning accuracy. CGRS
operates by dynamically suppressing the model's generation of reflection
triggers when it exhibits high confidence in its current response, thereby
preventing redundant reflection cycles without compromising output quality. Our
approach is model-agnostic, requires no retraining or architectural
modifications, and can be integrated seamlessly with existing autoregressive
generation pipelines. Extensive experiments across four reasoning benchmarks
(i.e., AIME24, AMC23, MATH500, and GPQA-D) demonstrate CGRS's effectiveness: it
reduces token usage by an average of 18.5% to 41.9% while preserving accuracy.
It also achieves the optimal balance between length reduction and performance
compared to state-of-the-art baselines. These results hold consistently across
model architectures (e.g., DeepSeek-R1-Distill series, QwQ-32B, and Qwen3
family) and scales (4B to 32B parameters), highlighting CGRS's practical value
for efficient reasoning.

Abstract: This paper presents an investigation into the impact of adding adjustment
features to an existing sign language (SL) avatar on a Microsoft Hololens 2
device. Through a detailed analysis of interactions of expert German Sign
Language (DGS) users with both adjustable and non-adjustable avatars in a
specific use case, this study identifies the key factors influencing the
comprehensibility, the user experience (UX), and the acceptability of such a
system. Despite user preference for adjustable settings, no significant
improvements in UX or comprehensibility were observed, which remained at low
levels, amid missing SL elements (mouthings and facial expressions) and
implementation issues (indistinct hand shapes, lack of feedback and menu
positioning). Hedonic quality was rated higher than pragmatic quality,
indicating that users found the system more emotionally or aesthetically
pleasing than functionally useful. Stress levels were higher for the adjustable
avatar, reflecting lower performance, greater effort and more frustration.
Additionally, concerns were raised about whether the Hololens adjustment
gestures are intuitive and easy to familiarise oneself with. While
acceptability of the concept of adjustability was generally positive, it was
strongly dependent on usability and animation quality. This study highlights
that personalisation alone is insufficient, and that SL avatars must be
comprehensible by default. Key recommendations include enhancing mouthing and
facial animation, improving interaction interfaces, and applying participatory
design.

Conclusion: 研究为LLM自校正提供了见解，并探讨了未来比较LLM生成反馈与人类专家直接输入的可行性。

Abstract: Agentic Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and 'deep research' systems aim
to enable autonomous search processes where Large Language Models (LLMs)
iteratively refine outputs. However, applying these systems to domain-specific
professional search, such as biomedical research, presents challenges, as
automated systems may reduce user involvement and misalign with expert
information needs. Professional search tasks often demand high levels of user
expertise and transparency. The BioASQ CLEF 2025 challenge, using
expert-formulated questions, can serve as a platform to study these issues. We
explored the performance of current reasoning and nonreasoning LLMs like
Gemini-Flash 2.0, o3-mini, o4-mini and DeepSeek-R1. A key aspect of our
methodology was a self-feedback mechanism where LLMs generated, evaluated, and
then refined their outputs for query expansion and for multiple answer types
(yes/no, factoid, list, ideal). We investigated whether this iterative
self-correction improves performance and if reasoning models are more capable
of generating useful feedback. Preliminary results indicate varied performance
for the self-feedback strategy across models and tasks. This work offers
insights into LLM self-correction and informs future work on comparing the
effectiveness of LLM-generated feedback with direct human expert input in these
search systems.

Conclusion: MyCulture通过开放式结构提高了公平性和区分能力，为LLM的文化评估提供了新方向。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit cultural biases due to training
data dominated by high-resource languages like English and Chinese. This poses
challenges for accurately representing and evaluating diverse cultural
contexts, particularly in low-resource language settings. To address this, we
introduce MyCulture, a benchmark designed to comprehensively evaluate LLMs on
Malaysian culture across six pillars: arts, attire, customs, entertainment,
food, and religion presented in Bahasa Melayu. Unlike conventional benchmarks,
MyCulture employs a novel open-ended multiple-choice question format without
predefined options, thereby reducing guessing and mitigating format bias. We
provide a theoretical justification for the effectiveness of this open-ended
structure in improving both fairness and discriminative power. Furthermore, we
analyze structural bias by comparing model performance on structured versus
free-form outputs, and assess language bias through multilingual prompt
variations. Our evaluation across a range of regional and international LLMs
reveals significant disparities in cultural comprehension, highlighting the
urgent need for culturally grounded and linguistically inclusive benchmarks in
the development and assessment of LLMs.

Result: 20个月的纵向研究表明，LLMEval-3能揭示模型的知识记忆上限和数据污染漏洞，排名稳定性和一致性表现优异。

Conclusion: LLMEval-3为评估LLM真实能力提供了可信方法，推动了更可靠的评估标准的发展。

Abstract: Existing evaluation of Large Language Models (LLMs) on static benchmarks is
vulnerable to data contamination and leaderboard overfitting, critical issues
that obscure true model capabilities. To address this, we introduce LLMEval-3,
a framework for dynamic evaluation of LLMs. LLMEval-3 is built on a proprietary
bank of 220k graduate-level questions, from which it dynamically samples unseen
test sets for each evaluation run. Its automated pipeline ensures integrity via
contamination-resistant data curation, a novel anti-cheating architecture, and
a calibrated LLM-as-a-judge process achieving 90% agreement with human experts,
complemented by a relative ranking system for fair comparison. An 20-month
longitudinal study of nearly 50 leading models reveals a performance ceiling on
knowledge memorization and exposes data contamination vulnerabilities
undetectable by static benchmarks. The framework demonstrates exceptional
robustness in ranking stability and consistency, providing strong empirical
validation for the dynamic evaluation paradigm. LLMEval-3 offers a robust and
credible methodology for assessing the true capabilities of LLMs beyond
leaderboard scores, promoting the development of more trustworthy evaluation
standards.

*Chenzhuo Zhao,Xinda Wang,Yue Huang,Junting Lu,Ziqian Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TASE是一个评估大语言模型（LLMs）在细粒度、符号级理解和结构推理能力的基准测试，涵盖10种任务，涉及中、英、韩三种语言。结果显示人类表现显著优于现有LLMs，揭示了其在符号级推理上的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在高层语义任务上表现优异，但在需要精确控制的细粒度和符号级任务上存在不足。TASE旨在评估和改进LLMs在这些方面的能力。

Method: TASE包含35,927个实例的评估集和可扩展的合成数据生成管道，涵盖符号感知和结构理解两大类任务，如字符计数、符号对齐等。评估了30多个主流LLMs，并训练了自定义模型Qwen2.5-14B。

Result: 人类表现显著优于LLMs，揭示了LLMs在符号级推理上的持续弱点。TASE为未来改进低层语言理解和跨语言泛化提供了诊断工具。

Conclusion: TASE揭示了LLMs在符号级任务上的局限性，为未来研究提供了新的评估和改进方向。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance
on high-level semantic tasks, they often struggle with fine-grained,
token-level understanding and structural reasoning--capabilities that are
essential for applications requiring precision and control. We introduce TASE,
a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs' ability to perceive and
reason about token-level information across languages. TASE covers 10 tasks
under two core categories: token awareness and structural understanding,
spanning Chinese, English, and Korean, with a 35,927-instance evaluation set
and a scalable synthetic data generation pipeline for training. Tasks include
character counting, token alignment, syntactic structure parsing, and length
constraint satisfaction. We evaluate over 30 leading commercial and open-source
LLMs, including O3, Claude 4, Gemini 2.5 Pro, and DeepSeek-R1, and train a
custom Qwen2.5-14B model using the GRPO training method. Results show that
human performance significantly outpaces current LLMs, revealing persistent
weaknesses in token-level reasoning. TASE sheds light on these limitations and
provides a new diagnostic lens for future improvements in low-level language
understanding and cross-lingual generalization. Our code and dataset are
publicly available at https://github.com/cyzcz/Tase .

TL;DR: 论文系统比较了多种创造力衡量指标，发现它们一致性有限，各有局限性，并呼吁更鲁棒的评估框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨不同创造力衡量指标的有效性和局限性，以改进创造力评估方法。

Method: 系统分析和比较创造力指数、困惑度、句法模板和LLM-as-a-Judge在多个创意领域的表现。

Result: 各指标一致性有限，分别捕捉不同创造力维度，且存在各自的局限性。

Conclusion: 需要开发更鲁棒、通用的评估框架，以更贴合人类对创造力的判断。

Abstract: We systematically examine, analyze, and compare representative creativity
measures--creativity index, perplexity, syntactic templates, and
LLM-as-a-Judge--across diverse creative domains, including creative writing,
unconventional problem-solving, and research ideation. Our analyses reveal that
these metrics exhibit limited consistency, capturing different dimensions of
creativity. We highlight key limitations, including the creativity index's
focus on lexical diversity, perplexity's sensitivity to model confidence, and
syntactic templates' inability to capture conceptual creativity. Additionally,
LLM-as-a-Judge shows instability and bias. Our findings underscore the need for
more robust, generalizable evaluation frameworks that better align with human
judgments of creativity.

*Yilin Xiao,Chuang Zhou,Qinggang Zhang,Su Dong,Shengyuan Chen,Xiao Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为LAG的新方法，通过逻辑分解和依赖感知推理增强语言模型的知识密集型任务表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在知识密集型任务中存在幻觉问题，现有检索增强生成方法在复杂推理场景中表现不足。

Method: LAG将复杂问题分解为原子子问题，按逻辑依赖顺序解决，并引入逻辑终止机制防止错误传播。

Result: 实验表明LAG显著提升了推理鲁棒性，减少幻觉，并更符合人类认知。

Conclusion: LAG为现有RAG系统提供了一种更原则性的替代方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
a wide range of tasks, yet exhibit critical limitations in knowledge-intensive
tasks, often generating hallucinations when faced with questions requiring
specialized expertise. While retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) mitigates
this by integrating external knowledge, it struggles with complex reasoning
scenarios due to its reliance on direct semantic retrieval and lack of
structured logical organization. Inspired by Cartesian principles from
\textit{Discours de la m\'ethode}, this paper introduces Logic-Augmented
Generation (LAG), a novel paradigm that reframes knowledge augmentation through
systematic question decomposition and dependency-aware reasoning. Specifically,
LAG first decomposes complex questions into atomic sub-questions ordered by
logical dependencies. It then resolves these sequentially, using prior answers
to guide context retrieval for subsequent sub-questions, ensuring stepwise
grounding in logical chain. To prevent error propagation, LAG incorporates a
logical termination mechanism that halts inference upon encountering
unanswerable sub-questions and reduces wasted computation on excessive
reasoning. Finally, it synthesizes all sub-resolutions to generate verified
responses. Experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that LAG
significantly enhances reasoning robustness, reduces hallucination, and aligns
LLM problem-solving with human cognition, offering a principled alternative to
existing RAG systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文通过20 Questions游戏评估大型语言模型（LLMs）在地理实体推理中的表现，发现模型对全球北方和西方的实体推理更成功，揭示了隐含的地理和文化偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLMs已针对显性偏见进行了调整，但其预训练数据中的隐性偏见仍存在。传统方法可能触发模型的防护机制，因此研究模型主动提问时的行为更具价值。

Method: 使用Geo20Q+数据集，在七种语言和两种游戏配置下测试LLMs的地理实体推理能力，分析其表现差异。

Result: LLMs对全球北方和西方的实体推理显著优于全球南方和东方，且语言对表现差异影响较小。预训练数据频率和维基百科浏览量无法完全解释这些差异。

Conclusion: 自由形式的评估框架能揭示LLMs中的隐性偏见，地理和文化差异嵌入其推理过程。数据集和代码已公开。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been extensively tuned to mitigate explicit
biases, yet they often exhibit subtle implicit biases rooted in their
pre-training data. Rather than directly probing LLMs with human-crafted
questions that may trigger guardrails, we propose studying how models behave
when they proactively ask questions themselves. The 20 Questions game, a
multi-turn deduction task, serves as an ideal testbed for this purpose. We
systematically evaluate geographic performance disparities in entity deduction
using a new dataset, Geo20Q+, consisting of both notable people and culturally
significant objects (e.g., foods, landmarks, animals) from diverse regions. We
test popular LLMs across two gameplay configurations (canonical 20-question and
unlimited turns) and in seven languages (English, Hindi, Mandarin, Japanese,
French, Spanish, and Turkish). Our results reveal geographic disparities: LLMs
are substantially more successful at deducing entities from the Global North
than the Global South, and the Global West than the Global East. While
Wikipedia pageviews and pre-training corpus frequency correlate mildly with
performance, they fail to fully explain these disparities. Notably, the
language in which the game is played has minimal impact on performance gaps.
These findings demonstrate the value of creative, free-form evaluation
frameworks for uncovering subtle biases in LLMs that remain hidden in standard
prompting setups. By analyzing how models initiate and pursue reasoning goals
over multiple turns, we find geographic and cultural disparities embedded in
their reasoning processes. We release the dataset (Geo20Q+) and code at
https://sites.google.com/view/llmbias20q/home.

TL;DR: CoCoLex是一种解码策略，通过动态结合模型生成的词汇分布和从上下文中复制的分布，提高法律文本生成的忠实度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在法律领域的应用受到生成不忠实或幻觉输出的限制，需要一种方法确保上下文的有效整合和忠实性。

Method: 提出Confidence-guided Copy-based Decoding (CoCoLex)，动态结合模型生成的词汇分布和从上下文中复制的分布，基于模型置信度鼓励直接复制。

Result: 在五个法律基准测试中，CoCoLex优于现有上下文感知解码方法，尤其在长文本生成任务中表现突出。

Conclusion: CoCoLex通过增强上下文的忠实整合，显著提升了法律文本生成的质量和可靠性。

Abstract: Due to their ability to process long and complex contexts, LLMs can offer key
benefits to the Legal domain, but their adoption has been hindered by their
tendency to generate unfaithful, ungrounded, or hallucinatory outputs. While
Retrieval-Augmented Generation offers a promising solution by grounding
generations in external knowledge, it offers no guarantee that the provided
context will be effectively integrated. To address this, context-aware decoding
strategies have been proposed to amplify the influence of relevant context, but
they usually do not explicitly enforce faithfulness to the context. In this
work, we introduce Confidence-guided Copy-based Decoding for Legal Text
Generation (CoCoLex)-a decoding strategy that dynamically interpolates the
model produced vocabulary distribution with a distribution derived based on
copying from the context. CoCoLex encourages direct copying based on the
model's confidence, ensuring greater fidelity to the source. Experimental
results on five legal benchmarks demonstrate that CoCoLex outperforms existing
context-aware decoding methods, particularly in long-form generation tasks.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于频率的不确定性量化方法，用于黑箱设置下的多选问答任务，通过共形预测提供可证明的覆盖保证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型语言模型在多选问答中的不可靠性问题（如幻觉和过度自信），以提升高风险领域的应用可信度。

Method: 通过多次独立采样模型的输出分布，利用最高频样本计算预测熵，并与共形预测结合。

Result: 在六个大型语言模型和四个数据集上的实验表明，频率预测熵在区分正确与错误预测方面优于基于logit的方法（AUROC指标）。

Conclusion: 该方法为黑箱场景提供了一种无需分布假设的模型无关框架，增强了大型语言模型在实际应用中的可信度。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable progress in
multiple-choice question answering (MCQA), but their inherent unreliability,
such as hallucination and overconfidence, limits their application in high-risk
domains. To address this, we propose a frequency-based uncertainty
quantification method under black-box settings, leveraging conformal prediction
(CP) to ensure provable coverage guarantees. Our approach involves multiple
independent samplings of the model's output distribution for each input, with
the most frequent sample serving as a reference to calculate predictive entropy
(PE). Experimental evaluations across six LLMs and four datasets (MedMCQA,
MedQA, MMLU, MMLU-Pro) demonstrate that frequency-based PE outperforms
logit-based PE in distinguishing between correct and incorrect predictions, as
measured by AUROC. Furthermore, the method effectively controls the empirical
miscoverage rate under user-specified risk levels, validating that sampling
frequency can serve as a viable substitute for logit-based probabilities in
black-box scenarios. This work provides a distribution-free model-agnostic
framework for reliable uncertainty quantification in MCQA with guaranteed
coverage, enhancing the trustworthiness of LLMs in practical applications.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，未对齐的多语言大语言模型（MLLMs）在政治观点上几乎没有显著的跨语言差异，而政治对齐后观点在五种西方语言中几乎一致变化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨跨文化政治观点差异是否在多语言大语言模型中表现为跨语言差异。

Method: 通过提示MLLMs对政治声明表达（不）同意，评估其观点，并在对齐前后比较跨语言差异。

Result: 未对齐模型的政治观点几乎没有跨语言差异；对齐后观点在五种语言中一致变化。

Conclusion: 西方语言背景下，政治观点在语言间转移，突显了MLLMs在社会语言、文化和政治对齐上的挑战。

Abstract: Public opinion surveys show cross-cultural differences in political opinions
between socio-cultural contexts. However, there is no clear evidence whether
these differences translate to cross-lingual differences in multilingual large
language models (MLLMs). We analyze whether opinions transfer between languages
or whether there are separate opinions for each language in MLLMs of various
sizes across five Western languages. We evaluate MLLMs' opinions by prompting
them to report their (dis)agreement with political statements from voting
advice applications. To better understand the interaction between languages in
the models, we evaluate them both before and after aligning them with more left
or right views using direct preference optimization and English alignment data
only. Our findings reveal that unaligned models show only very few significant
cross-lingual differences in the political opinions they reflect. The political
alignment shifts opinions almost uniformly across all five languages. We
conclude that in Western language contexts, political opinions transfer between
languages, demonstrating the challenges in achieving explicit socio-linguistic,
cultural, and political alignment of MLLMs.

TL;DR: MathSmith是一个新框架，通过从零生成高难度数学问题来增强大语言模型的推理能力，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖人工模板，数据多样性和可扩展性受限，需要高质量高难度训练数据。

Method: 从PlanetMath随机采样概念-解释对生成新问题，采用强化学习优化问题结构、推理复杂度和答案一致性。

Result: 在五个基准测试中表现优于基线，尤其在长链推理任务中。

Conclusion: MathSmith展示了高难度合成数据在提升LLM推理能力中的潜力，具有强扩展性和泛化性。

Abstract: Large language models have achieved substantial progress in mathematical
reasoning, yet their advancement is limited by the scarcity of high-quality,
high-difficulty training data. Existing synthesis methods largely rely on
transforming human-written templates, limiting both diversity and scalability.
We propose MathSmith, a novel framework for synthesizing challenging
mathematical problems to enhance LLM reasoning. Rather than modifying existing
problems, MathSmith constructs new ones from scratch by randomly sampling
concept-explanation pairs from PlanetMath, ensuring data independence and
avoiding contamination. To increase difficulty, we design nine predefined
strategies as soft constraints during rationales. We further adopts
reinforcement learning to jointly optimize structural validity, reasoning
complexity, and answer consistency. The length of the reasoning trace generated
under autoregressive prompting is used to reflect cognitive complexity,
encouraging the creation of more demanding problems aligned with
long-chain-of-thought reasoning. Experiments across five benchmarks,
categorized as easy & medium (GSM8K, MATH-500) and hard (AIME2024, AIME2025,
OlympiadBench), show that MathSmith consistently outperforms existing baselines
under both short and long CoT settings. Additionally, a weakness-focused
variant generation module enables targeted improvement on specific concepts.
Overall, MathSmith exhibits strong scalability, generalization, and
transferability, highlighting the promise of high-difficulty synthetic data in
advancing LLM reasoning capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有奖励模型存在规则奖励不稳健和模型奖励易受奖励攻击的问题，需改进。

Method: 提出Cooper框架，结合规则奖励的高精度和动态构建正负样本对优化奖励模型，并引入混合标注策略和基于参考的奖励建模。

Result: Cooper缓解了奖励攻击，提升了端到端强化学习性能，如在Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct上平均准确率提升0.54%。

Conclusion: 动态更新奖励模型是应对奖励攻击的有效方法，为奖励模型与强化学习的更好结合提供了参考。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in
reasoning tasks, where reinforcement learning (RL) serves as a key algorithm
for enhancing their reasoning capabilities. Currently, there are two mainstream
reward paradigms: model-based rewards and rule-based rewards. However, both
approaches suffer from limitations: rule-based rewards lack robustness, while
model-based rewards are vulnerable to reward hacking. To address these issues,
we propose Cooper(Co-optimizing Policy Model and Reward Model), a RL framework
that jointly optimizes both the policy model and the reward model. Cooper
leverages the high precision of rule-based rewards when identifying correct
responses, and dynamically constructs and selects positive-negative sample
pairs for continued training the reward model. This design enhances robustness
and mitigates the risk of reward hacking. To further support Cooper, we
introduce a hybrid annotation strategy that efficiently and accurately
generates training data for the reward model. We also propose a reference-based
reward modeling paradigm, where the reward model takes a reference answer as
input. Based on this design, we train a reward model named VerifyRM, which
achieves higher accuracy on VerifyBench compared to other models of the same
size. We conduct reinforcement learning using both VerifyRM and Cooper. Our
experiments show that Cooper not only alleviates reward hacking but also
improves end-to-end RL performance, for instance, achieving a 0.54% gain in
average accuracy on Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct. Our findings demonstrate that
dynamically updating reward model is an effective way to combat reward hacking,
providing a reference for better integrating reward models into RL.

Motivation: 探索语言模型在具身推理中的能力，填补现有评估方法的不足，特别是在动态工具获取和自主协调方面。

Method: 通过文本环境表示建模连续物理属性和复杂空间关系，覆盖1,500个家庭和工业场景，系统评估模型性能。

Result: 模型在明确指令下表现良好（85-96%成功率），但在工具推理（56-85%）和隐式协作（63-85%）中性能下降，复合任务失败率超50%。微调对单智能体任务提升显著（0.6%到76.3%），但对多智能体任务效果有限（1.5%到5.5%）。

Conclusion: 具身推理对当前模型构成根本性挑战，OmniEAR为评估和推进具身AI系统提供了严格基准。

Abstract: Large language models excel at abstract reasoning but their capacity for
embodied agent reasoning remains largely unexplored. We present OmniEAR, a
comprehensive framework for evaluating how language models reason about
physical interactions, tool usage, and multi-agent coordination in embodied
tasks. Unlike existing benchmarks that provide predefined tool sets or explicit
collaboration directives, OmniEAR requires agents to dynamically acquire
capabilities and autonomously determine coordination strategies based on task
demands. Through text-based environment representation, we model continuous
physical properties and complex spatial relationships across 1,500 scenarios
spanning household and industrial domains. Our systematic evaluation reveals
severe performance degradation when models must reason from constraints: while
achieving 85-96% success with explicit instructions, performance drops to
56-85% for tool reasoning and 63-85% for implicit collaboration, with compound
tasks showing over 50% failure rates. Surprisingly, complete environmental
information degrades coordination performance, indicating models cannot filter
task-relevant constraints. Fine-tuning improves single-agent tasks dramatically
(0.6% to 76.3%) but yields minimal multi-agent gains (1.5% to 5.5%), exposing
fundamental architectural limitations. These findings demonstrate that embodied
reasoning poses fundamentally different challenges than current models can
address, establishing OmniEAR as a rigorous benchmark for evaluating and
advancing embodied AI systems. Our code and data are included in the
supplementary materials and will be open-sourced upon acceptance.

Motivation: 尽管推理型大型语言模型在复杂任务中表现优异，但在长篇事实性任务中幻觉生成较多，且现有在线强化学习方法因缺乏可靠验证机制而难以直接应用。

Method: 提出了一种新的奖励函数，综合考虑事实精确性、回答详细程度和相关性，并应用于在线强化学习。

Result: 在六个长篇事实性基准测试中，模型平均减少23.1%的幻觉率，回答详细程度提升23%，且整体回答有用性未下降。

Conclusion: 新奖励函数结合在线强化学习有效提升了大型语言模型的长篇事实性推理能力，减少了幻觉生成。

Abstract: Reasoning Large Language Models (R-LLMs) have significantly advanced complex
reasoning tasks but often struggle with factuality, generating substantially
more hallucinations than their non-reasoning counterparts on long-form
factuality benchmarks. However, extending online Reinforcement Learning (RL), a
key component in recent R-LLM advancements, to the long-form factuality setting
poses several unique challenges due to the lack of reliable verification
methods. Previous work has utilized automatic factuality evaluation frameworks
such as FActScore to curate preference data in the offline RL setting, yet we
find that directly leveraging such methods as the reward in online RL leads to
reward hacking in multiple ways, such as producing less detailed or relevant
responses. We propose a novel reward function that simultaneously considers the
factual precision, response detail level, and answer relevance, and applies
online RL to learn high quality factual reasoning. Evaluated on six long-form
factuality benchmarks, our factual reasoning model achieves an average
reduction of 23.1 percentage points in hallucination rate, a 23% increase in
answer detail level, and no degradation in the overall response helpfulness.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了如何利用线性探针（probes）研究大型语言模型（LLMs）在多轮对话中的说服动态，发现探针在捕捉说服成功、被说服者个性和说服策略等方面表现优异，甚至在某些情况下优于基于提示的方法。

Motivation: 理解LLMs如何说服人类是一个尚未充分研究的领域，线性探针作为一种轻量级工具，可用于分析模型在复杂行为（如说服）中的表现。

Method: 利用认知科学的见解，训练探针对话中的说服动态，包括说服成功、被说服者个性和说服策略等方面。

Result: 探针在多轮对话中能准确识别说服成功的时刻和策略，且在某些任务中表现优于基于提示的方法。

Conclusion: 线性探针是研究复杂行为（如欺骗和操纵）的有效工具，尤其适用于多轮对话和大规模数据集分析。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have started to demonstrate the ability to
persuade humans, yet our understanding of how this dynamic transpires is
limited. Recent work has used linear probes, lightweight tools for analyzing
model representations, to study various LLM skills such as the ability to model
user sentiment and political perspective. Motivated by this, we apply probes to
study persuasion dynamics in natural, multi-turn conversations. We leverage
insights from cognitive science to train probes on distinct aspects of
persuasion: persuasion success, persuadee personality, and persuasion strategy.
Despite their simplicity, we show that they capture various aspects of
persuasion at both the sample and dataset levels. For instance, probes can
identify the point in a conversation where the persuadee was persuaded or where
persuasive success generally occurs across the entire dataset. We also show
that in addition to being faster than expensive prompting-based approaches,
probes can do just as well and even outperform prompting in some settings, such
as when uncovering persuasion strategy. This suggests probes as a plausible
avenue for studying other complex behaviours such as deception and
manipulation, especially in multi-turn settings and large-scale dataset
analysis where prompting-based methods would be computationally inefficient.

TL;DR: H-NET++是一种分层动态分块模型，通过端到端训练学习语言感知的分割，解决了字节级语言模型在形态丰富语言中的计算挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 字节级语言模型避免了脆弱的标记器，但在形态丰富的语言中，单词跨越多个字节，导致计算挑战。

Method: H-NET++采用轻量级Transformer上下文混合器、两级潜在超先验、专门处理拼写伪影（如波斯ZWNJ）以及基于课程的训练。

Result: 在1.4B标记的波斯语语料库上，H-NET++实现了最佳结果：比BPE-based GPT-2-fa压缩率提高12%，ParsGLUE提升5.4pp，ZWNJ损坏鲁棒性提高53%，形态边界F1为73.8%。

Conclusion: 分层动态分块为形态丰富语言提供了一种无需标记器的有效解决方案，同时保持计算效率。

Abstract: Byte-level language models eliminate fragile tokenizers but face
computational challenges in morphologically-rich languages (MRLs), where words
span many bytes. We propose H-NET++, a hierarchical dynamic-chunking model that
learns linguistically-informed segmentation through end-to-end training. Key
innovations include: (1) a lightweight Transformer context-mixer (1.9M
parameters) for cross-chunk attention, (2) a two-level latent hyper-prior for
document-level consistency, (3) specialized handling of orthographic artifacts
(e.g. Persian ZWNJ), and (4) curriculum-based training with staged sequence
lengths. On a 1.4B-token Persian corpus, H-NET++ achieves state-of-the-art
results: 0.159 BPB reduction versus BPE-based GPT-2-fa (12% better
compression), 5.4pp gain on ParsGLUE, 53% improved robustness to ZWNJ
corruption, and 73.8% F1 on gold morphological boundaries. Our learned chunks
align with Persian morphology without explicit supervision, demonstrating that
hierarchical dynamic chunking provides an effective tokenizer-free solution for
MRLs while maintaining computational efficiency.
