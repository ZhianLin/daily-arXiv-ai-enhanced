### [1] [Beyond CNNs: Efficient Fine-Tuning of Multi-Modal LLMs for Object Detection on Low-Data Regimes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08589)
*Nirmal Elamon,Rouzbeh Davoudi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文比较了传统CNN、零样本多模态LLM和微调多模态LLM在图像中人工文本叠加检测任务上的表现，发现LLM只需少量数据微调即可显著提升性能，匹配甚至超越需要大量数据的CNN模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索多模态大语言模型在视觉任务中的潜力，特别是在数据有限的情况下，如何通过微调充分发挥其能力，弥补传统CNN模型需要大量数据的不足。

Method: 对传统CNN、零样本预训练多模态LLM和微调多模态LLM进行综合比较，特别关注LLM在少量数据（少于1000张图像）下的微调效果。

Result: LLM经过微调后准确率提升高达36%，能够匹配或超越需要大量数据的CNN基线模型，展示了LLM在数据效率方面的优势。

Conclusion: 多模态LLM在低资源视觉环境中具有出色的适应性和数据效率，为跨模态学习提供了有效的策略指导，并证明了语言引导模型在精确视觉理解任务中的潜力。

Abstract: The field of object detection and understanding is rapidly evolving, driven
by advances in both traditional CNN-based models and emerging multi-modal large
language models (LLMs). While CNNs like ResNet and YOLO remain highly effective
for image-based tasks, recent transformer-based LLMs introduce new capabilities
such as dynamic context reasoning, language-guided prompts, and holistic scene
understanding. However, when used out-of-the-box, the full potential of LLMs
remains underexploited, often resulting in suboptimal performance on
specialized visual tasks. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive comparison
of fine-tuned traditional CNNs, zero-shot pre-trained multi-modal LLMs, and
fine-tuned multi-modal LLMs on the challenging task of artificial text overlay
detection in images. A key contribution of our study is demonstrating that LLMs
can be effectively fine-tuned on very limited data (fewer than 1,000 images) to
achieve up to 36% accuracy improvement, matching or surpassing CNN-based
baselines that typically require orders of magnitude more data. By exploring
how language-guided models can be adapted for precise visual understanding with
minimal supervision, our work contributes to the broader effort of bridging
vision and language, offering novel insights into efficient cross-modal
learning strategies. These findings highlight the adaptability and data
efficiency of LLM-based approaches for real-world object detection tasks and
provide actionable guidance for applying multi-modal transformers in
low-resource visual environments. To support continued progress in this area,
we have made the code used to fine-tune the models available in our GitHub,
enabling future improvements and reuse in related applications.

### [2] [Zero-shot image privacy classification with Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09253)
*Alina Elena Baia,Alessio Xompero,Andrea Cavallaro*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文建立了图像隐私分类的零样本基准，评估了开源视觉语言模型与传统专用模型在隐私预测性能、效率和鲁棒性方面的对比。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前文献倾向于采用为通用任务设计的视觉语言模型，但缺乏系统评估可能导致忽视专用模型的性能上限，需要公平比较。

Method: 建立零样本基准，使用任务对齐提示评估前3名开源视觉语言模型，并与已建立的视觉专用和多模态方法对比性能、效率和鲁棒性。

Result: 视觉语言模型尽管参数多、推理慢，但在隐私预测准确性上落后于更小的专用模型，但对图像扰动的鲁棒性更高。

Conclusion: 视觉语言模型在图像隐私预测任务中尚未超越专用模型，但具有更好的鲁棒性，需要在资源消耗和性能之间权衡。

Abstract: While specialized learning-based models have historically dominated image
privacy prediction, the current literature increasingly favours adopting large
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) designed for generic tasks. This trend risks
overlooking the performance ceiling set by purpose-built models due to a lack
of systematic evaluation. To address this problem, we establish a zero-shot
benchmark for image privacy classification, enabling a fair comparison. We
evaluate the top-3 open-source VLMs, according to a privacy benchmark, using
task-aligned prompts and we contrast their performance, efficiency, and
robustness against established vision-only and multi-modal methods.
Counter-intuitively, our results show that VLMs, despite their
resource-intensive nature in terms of high parameter count and slower
inference, currently lag behind specialized, smaller models in privacy
prediction accuracy. We also find that VLMs exhibit higher robustness to image
perturbations.

*Saumya B*

Main category: cs.CV

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 脑肿瘤分割对诊断和治疗规划至关重要，但类别不平衡和模型泛化能力有限等问题阻碍了进展，需要建立可重复的基准方法。

Method: 使用U-Net架构，结合焦点损失函数进行参数调优，并评估三种基础数据增强技术：水平翻转、旋转和缩放。

Result: 使用焦点损失的U-Net达到了90%的精确度，与最先进方法结果相当。

Conclusion: 通过公开所有代码和结果，本研究建立了透明、可重复的基准，为未来脑肿瘤分割中的数据增强策略和损失函数设计研究提供指导。

Abstract: Brain tumor segmentation is crucial for diagnosis and treatment planning, yet
challenges such as class imbalance and limited model generalization continue to
hinder progress. This work presents a reproducible evaluation of U-Net
segmentation performance on brain tumor MRI using focal loss and basic data
augmentation strategies. Experiments were conducted on a publicly available MRI
dataset, focusing on focal loss parameter tuning and assessing the impact of
three data augmentation techniques: horizontal flip, rotation, and scaling. The
U-Net with focal loss achieved a precision of 90%, comparable to
state-of-the-art results. By making all code and results publicly available,
this study establishes a transparent, reproducible baseline to guide future
research on augmentation strategies and loss function design in brain tumor
segmentation.

### [4] [Adjusting Initial Noise to Mitigate Memorization in Text-to-Image Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08625)
*Hyeonggeun Han,Sehwan Kim,Hyungjun Joo,Sangwoo Hong,Jungwoo Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文研究了文本到图像扩散模型中的记忆化问题，提出了通过调整初始噪声样本来促进早期逃逸记忆化吸引盆的方法，从而在减少记忆化的同时保持图像-文本对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文本到图像扩散模型经常记忆并复制训练数据，引发隐私和版权担忧。现有方法延迟应用分类器自由引导(CFG)来避免记忆化，但这会导致图像与提示对齐不佳。

Method: 提出两种缓解策略：集体或单独调整初始噪声样本，寻找能够促进早期逃逸记忆化吸引盆的初始样本。

Result: 这些方法显著减少了记忆化，同时保持了图像-文本对齐。

Conclusion: 初始噪声样本在决定记忆化逃逸时间方面起关键作用，通过调整初始噪声可以有效缓解记忆化问题。

Abstract: Despite their impressive generative capabilities, text-to-image diffusion
models often memorize and replicate training data, prompting serious concerns
over privacy and copyright. Recent work has attributed this memorization to an
attraction basin-a region where applying classifier-free guidance (CFG) steers
the denoising trajectory toward memorized outputs-and has proposed deferring
CFG application until the denoising trajectory escapes this basin. However,
such delays often result in non-memorized images that are poorly aligned with
the input prompts, highlighting the need to promote earlier escape so that CFG
can be applied sooner in the denoising process. In this work, we show that the
initial noise sample plays a crucial role in determining when this escape
occurs. We empirically observe that different initial samples lead to varying
escape times. Building on this insight, we propose two mitigation strategies
that adjust the initial noise-either collectively or individually-to find and
utilize initial samples that encourage earlier basin escape. These approaches
significantly reduce memorization while preserving image-text alignment.

### [5] [The Digital Mirror: Gender Bias and Occupational Stereotypes in AI-Generated Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08628)
*Siiri Leppälampi,Sonja M. Hyrynsalmi,Erno Vanhala*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究测试了AI生成图像中的表征偏见，发现DALL-E 3和Ideogram都强化了传统性别刻板印象，并提出增加性别可见图像多样性的建议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI生成可视化研究主要关注创建过程和质量，忽视了表征偏见问题，特别是在职业场景中可能存在的性别偏见。

Method: 通过生成750多张AI职业图像，使用主题分析方法比较DALL-E 3和Ideogram两个AI图像生成工具的表现。

Result: 两个AI工具都强化了传统性别刻板印象，尽管程度不同，表明AI可视化工具存在强化狭隘表征的风险。

Conclusion: 需要采取措施缓解有害的性别偏见，确保媒体和专业场景中的多样化表征，为从业者、个人和研究者提供增加图像性别多样性的建议。

Abstract: Generative AI offers vast opportunities for creating visualisations, such as
graphics, videos, and images. However, recent studies around AI-generated
visualisations have primarily focused on the creation process and image
quality, overlooking representational biases. This study addresses this gap by
testing representation biases in AI-generated pictures in an occupational
setting and evaluating how two AI image generator tools, DALL-E 3 and Ideogram,
compare. Additionally, the study discusses topics such as ageing and emotions
in AI-generated images. As AI image tools are becoming more widely used,
addressing and mitigating harmful gender biases becomes essential to ensure
diverse representation in media and professional settings. In this study, over
750 AI-generated images of occupations were prompted. The thematic analysis
results revealed that both DALL-E 3 and Ideogram reinforce traditional gender
stereotypes in AI-generated images, although to varying degrees. These findings
emphasise that AI visualisation tools risk reinforcing narrow representations.
In our discussion section, we propose suggestions for practitioners,
individuals and researchers to increase representation when generating images
with visible genders.

### [6] [Dynamic Mixture-of-Experts for Visual Autoregressive Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08629)
*Jort Vincenti,Metod Jazbec,Guoxuan Xia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种集成动态专家混合路由器的视觉自回归模型，通过尺度感知阈值策略在无需额外训练的情况下减少计算冗余，实现20% FLOPs减少和11%推理加速，同时保持图像质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉自回归模型在图像生成中虽然高效且质量高，但在分辨率递增时存在重复Transformer调用的计算冗余问题。

Method: 在VAR中集成动态专家混合路由器，采用尺度感知阈值策略，根据token复杂度和分辨率平衡专家选择。

Result: 实现了20% FLOPs减少、11%推理加速，同时图像质量与密集基线模型相当。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了VAR模型的计算冗余问题，在保持生成质量的同时显著提升了计算效率。

Abstract: Visual Autoregressive Models (VAR) offer efficient and high-quality image
generation but suffer from computational redundancy due to repeated Transformer
calls at increasing resolutions. We introduce a dynamic Mixture-of-Experts
router integrated into VAR. The new architecture allows to trade compute for
quality through scale-aware thresholding. This thresholding strategy balances
expert selection based on token complexity and resolution, without requiring
additional training. As a result, we achieve 20% fewer FLOPs, 11% faster
inference and match the image quality achieved by the dense baseline.

### [7] [Out-of-Distribution Detection in LiDAR Semantic Segmentation Using Epistemic Uncertainty from Hierarchical GMMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08631)
*Hanieh Shojaei Miandashti,Claus Brenner*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于层次贝叶斯建模的无监督OOD检测方法，通过分离认知不确定性和偶然不确定性，在LiDAR点云语义分割中显著提升了未知物体检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有无监督OOD检测方法依赖预测熵，但会混淆认知不确定性和偶然不确定性，导致将分布内模糊区域误分类为OOD。需要一种能准确分离这两种不确定性的方法。

Method: 使用层次贝叶斯建模对深度神经网络特征空间中的高斯混合模型参数进行建模，从中提取认知不确定性，无需辅助数据或额外训练阶段。

Result: 在SemanticKITTI数据集上，相比基于预测熵的方法，AUROC提升18%，AUPRC提升22%，FPR95从76%降至40%（改善36%）。

Conclusion: 提出的基于认知不确定性的无监督OOD检测方法能有效分离模型和数据不确定性，显著优于现有方法，无需额外数据或训练。

Abstract: In addition to accurate scene understanding through precise semantic
segmentation of LiDAR point clouds, detecting out-of-distribution (OOD)
objects, instances not encountered during training, is essential to prevent the
incorrect assignment of unknown objects to known classes. While supervised OOD
detection methods depend on auxiliary OOD datasets, unsupervised methods avoid
this requirement but typically rely on predictive entropy, the entropy of the
predictive distribution obtained by averaging over an ensemble or multiple
posterior weight samples. However, these methods often conflate epistemic
(model) and aleatoric (data) uncertainties, misclassifying ambiguous in
distribution regions as OOD. To address this issue, we present an unsupervised
OOD detection approach that employs epistemic uncertainty derived from
hierarchical Bayesian modeling of Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) parameters in
the feature space of a deep neural network. Without requiring auxiliary data or
additional training stages, our approach outperforms existing uncertainty-based
methods on the SemanticKITTI dataset, achieving an 18\% improvement in AUROC,
22\% increase in AUPRC, and 36\% reduction in FPR95 (from 76\% to 40\%),
compared to the predictive entropy approach used in prior works.

### [8] [Hi-OSCAR: Hierarchical Open-set Classifier for Human Activity Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08635)
*Conor McCarthy,Loes Quirijnen,Jan Peter van Zandwijk,Zeno Geradts,Marcel Worring*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Hi-OSCAR：一种用于活动识别的分层开放集分类器，能够在保持最先进准确率的同时拒绝未知活动，并将未知类定位到最近的内部节点


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在人类活动识别中，真实生活中执行的活动范围与标注传感器数据集中可捕获的活动之间存在巨大差距，未能正确处理未见活动会严重削弱分类器的可靠性

Method: 将活动类别组织成结构化层次结构，开发Hi-OSCAR分层开放集分类器，同时收集新的NFI_FARED数据集

Result: 能够以最先进准确率识别已知活动，同时拒绝未知活动，并提供超越二元"已知/未知"分类的洞察

Conclusion: Hi-OSCAR不仅实现了开放集分类，还允许将未知类定位到最近的内部节点，为开放集HAR研究提供了新数据集和有效方法

Abstract: Within Human Activity Recognition (HAR), there is an insurmountable gap
between the range of activities performed in life and those that can be
captured in an annotated sensor dataset used in training. Failure to properly
handle unseen activities seriously undermines any HAR classifier's reliability.
Additionally within HAR, not all classes are equally dissimilar, some
significantly overlap or encompass other sub-activities. Based on these
observations, we arrange activity classes into a structured hierarchy. From
there, we propose Hi-OSCAR: a Hierarchical Open-set Classifier for Activity
Recognition, that can identify known activities at state-of-the-art accuracy
while simultaneously rejecting unknown activities. This not only enables
open-set classification, but also allows for unknown classes to be localized to
the nearest internal node, providing insight beyond a binary "known/unknown"
classification. To facilitate this and future open-set HAR research, we
collected a new dataset: NFI_FARED. NFI_FARED contains data from multiple
subjects performing nineteen activities from a range of contexts, including
daily living, commuting, and rapid movements, which is fully public and
available for download.

### [9] [Detection of high-frequency oscillations using time-frequency analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08637)
*Mostafa Mohammadpour,Mehdi Zekriyapanah Gashti,Yusif S. Gasimov*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 开发了一种基于无监督聚类的高频振荡自动检测方法，在80-500Hz频段检测癫痫患者中的高频振荡，相比现有方法具有更高的敏感性和精确度，且与手术结果相关性更强。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高频振荡是识别癫痫灶的新生物标志物，但视觉识别耗时费力且主观，需要开发自动检测方法用于研究和临床应用。

Method: 使用时频域的S变换提取事件，采用无监督聚类技术将高频振荡事件与尖峰、背景活动和伪影区分开来。

Result: 在控制数据集上敏感性97.67%、精确度98.57%、F分数97.78%；在癫痫患者中，切除与非切除接触点的高频振荡率比值为0.73，与手术结果相关性更强。

Conclusion: 高频振荡是癫痫患者中癫痫发生性的有前景生物标志物，切除高频振荡（特别是快速波纹）可导致癫痫自由，而残留高频振荡则导致癫痫复发。

Abstract: High-frequency oscillations (HFOs) are a new biomarker for identifying the
epileptogenic zone. Mapping HFO-generating regions can improve the precision of
resection sites in patients with refractory epilepsy. However, detecting HFOs
remains challenging, and their clinical features are not yet fully defined.
Visual identification of HFOs is time-consuming, labor-intensive, and
subjective. As a result, developing automated methods to detect HFOs is
critical for research and clinical use. In this study, we developed a novel
method for detecting HFOs in the ripple and fast ripple frequency bands (80-500
Hz). We validated it using both controlled datasets and data from epilepsy
patients. Our method employs an unsupervised clustering technique to categorize
events extracted from the time-frequency domain using the S-transform. The
proposed detector differentiates HFOs events from spikes, background activity,
and artifacts. Compared to existing detectors, our method achieved a
sensitivity of 97.67%, a precision of 98.57%, and an F-score of 97.78% on the
controlled dataset. In epilepsy patients, our results showed a stronger
correlation with surgical outcomes, with a ratio of 0.73 between HFOs rates in
resected versus non-resected contacts. The study confirmed previous findings
that HFOs are promising biomarkers of epileptogenicity in epileptic patients.
Removing HFOs, especially fast ripple, leads to seizure freedom, while
remaining HFOs lead to seizure recurrence.

### [10] [Into the Rabbit Hull: From Task-Relevant Concepts in DINO to Minkowski Geometry](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08638)
*Thomas Fel,Binxu Wang,Michael A. Lepori,Matthew Kowal,Andrew Lee,Randall Balestriero,Sonia Joseph,Ekdeep S. Lubana,Talia Konkle,Demba Ba,Martin Wattenberg*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文分析了DINOv2模型的内部表示机制，通过稀疏自编码器构建了32,000个概念的字典，发现模型表示具有功能专业化特征，并提出基于凸混合原型组合的Minkowski表示假说。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管DINOv2被广泛用于物体、场景和动作识别，但其内部感知机制仍不明确。研究旨在理解该模型的表示本质，超越传统的线性表示假说。

Method: 采用线性表示假说作为基线，使用稀疏自编码器构建32,000个单元的概念字典，分析不同下游任务如何利用这些概念，并研究表示几何和统计特性。

Result: 发现功能专业化：分类利用'Elsewhere'概念实现学习否定；分割依赖边界检测器形成连贯子空间；深度估计使用三种单目深度线索。表示部分密集而非严格稀疏，具有低维局部连接结构。

Conclusion: 提出Minkowski表示假说，认为token是通过原型（如动物中的兔子、颜色中的棕色）的凸混合组合形成的，这种结构基于概念空间理论，为理解视觉变换器表示提供了新视角。

Abstract: DINOv2 is routinely deployed to recognize objects, scenes, and actions; yet
the nature of what it perceives remains unknown. As a working baseline, we
adopt the Linear Representation Hypothesis (LRH) and operationalize it using
SAEs, producing a 32,000-unit dictionary that serves as the interpretability
backbone of our study, which unfolds in three parts.
  In the first part, we analyze how different downstream tasks recruit concepts
from our learned dictionary, revealing functional specialization:
classification exploits "Elsewhere" concepts that fire everywhere except on
target objects, implementing learned negations; segmentation relies on boundary
detectors forming coherent subspaces; depth estimation draws on three distinct
monocular depth cues matching visual neuroscience principles.
  Following these functional results, we analyze the geometry and statistics of
the concepts learned by the SAE. We found that representations are partly dense
rather than strictly sparse. The dictionary evolves toward greater coherence
and departs from maximally orthogonal ideals (Grassmannian frames). Within an
image, tokens occupy a low dimensional, locally connected set persisting after
removing position. These signs suggest representations are organized beyond
linear sparsity alone.
  Synthesizing these observations, we propose a refined view: tokens are formed
by combining convex mixtures of archetypes (e.g., a rabbit among animals, brown
among colors, fluffy among textures). This structure is grounded in Gardenfors'
conceptual spaces and in the model's mechanism as multi-head attention produces
sums of convex mixtures, defining regions bounded by archetypes. We introduce
the Minkowski Representation Hypothesis (MRH) and examine its empirical
signatures and implications for interpreting vision-transformer
representations.

*Maoliang Li,Ke Li,Yaoyang Liu,Jiayu Chen,Zihao Zheng,Yinjun Wu,Xiang Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出HiMIR框架，通过分层检索和冗余最小化，提升多模态检索的准确性和效率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统检索方法准确率有限，现有多向量检索方法在图像对象对齐和细粒度片段冗余方面存在不足

Method: 采用分层范式处理不同图像对象，利用跨层次相似性一致性和层次稀疏性减少冗余匹配计算，自动配置数据集参数

Result: 在现有MVR系统基础上，准确率显著提升，计算量减少高达3.5倍

Conclusion: HiMIR框架在提升检索准确性的同时大幅降低了计算开销，适用于多样化场景

Abstract: To effectively leverage user-specific data, retrieval augmented generation
(RAG) is employed in multimodal large language model (MLLM) applications.
However, conventional retrieval approaches often suffer from limited retrieval
accuracy. Recent advances in multi-vector retrieval (MVR) improve accuracy by
decomposing queries and matching against segmented images. They still suffer
from sub-optimal accuracy and efficiency, overlooking alignment between the
query and varying image objects and redundant fine-grained image segments. In
this work, we present an efficient scheduling framework for image retrieval -
HiMIR. First, we introduce a novel hierarchical paradigm, employing multiple
intermediate granularities for varying image objects to enhance alignment.
Second, we minimize redundancy in retrieval by leveraging cross-hierarchy
similarity consistency and hierarchy sparsity to minimize unnecessary matching
computation. Furthermore, we configure parameters for each dataset
automatically for practicality across diverse scenarios. Our empirical study
shows that, HiMIR not only achieves substantial accuracy improvements but also
reduces computation by up to 3.5 times over the existing MVR system.

Conclusion: PhyDAE通过显式建模退化物理和智能专家激活机制，有效解决了遥感图像多退化修复问题，在性能和效率方面均优于现有方法。

Abstract: Remote sensing images inevitably suffer from various degradation factors
during acquisition, including atmospheric interference, sensor limitations, and
imaging conditions. These complex and heterogeneous degradations pose severe
challenges to image quality and downstream interpretation tasks. Addressing
limitations of existing all-in-one restoration methods that overly rely on
implicit feature representations and lack explicit modeling of degradation
physics, this paper proposes Physics-Guided Degradation-Adaptive Experts
(PhyDAE). The method employs a two-stage cascaded architecture transforming
degradation information from implicit features into explicit decision signals,
enabling precise identification and differentiated processing of multiple
heterogeneous degradations including haze, noise, blur, and low-light
conditions. The model incorporates progressive degradation mining and
exploitation mechanisms, where the Residual Manifold Projector (RMP) and
Frequency-Aware Degradation Decomposer (FADD) comprehensively analyze
degradation characteristics from manifold geometry and frequency perspectives.
Physics-aware expert modules and temperature-controlled sparse activation
strategies are introduced to enhance computational efficiency while ensuring
imaging physics consistency. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets
(MD-RSID, MD-RRSHID, and MDRS-Landsat) demonstrate that PhyDAE achieves
superior performance across all four restoration tasks, comprehensively
outperforming state-of-the-art methods. Notably, PhyDAE substantially improves
restoration quality while achieving significant reductions in parameter count
and computational complexity, resulting in remarkable efficiency gains compared
to mainstream approaches and achieving optimal balance between performance and
efficiency. Code is available at https://github.com/HIT-SIRS/PhyDAE.

Conclusion: 通过开源完整流程证明高性能医学VLM可以透明实现，为可访问和有影响力的临床AI提供基础工具。

Abstract: Real-world clinical decision-making grapples with integrating information
from diverse data modalities, including medical text, 2D/3D images, and video,
leading to inefficiencies and potential diagnostic oversights. While generalist
vision-language models (VLMs) offer promise, their medical development faces
challenges of opaque pipelines, data scarcity, and architectural inflexibility.
Here we present Hulu-Med, a transparent medical VLM that unifies understanding
across all these modalities. Built upon a unified patch-based vision encoder
and an LLM decoder, Hulu-Med was progressively trained on 16.7 million (M)
samples to scale from 2D to 3D and video comprehension. The medical-aware token
reduction enables efficient training, requiring only 4,000 to 40,000 GPU hours
for 7B to 32B parameter variants. Extensive evaluation across 30 benchmarks
exhibits state-of-the-art performance, surpassing leading open-source models
and competing with proprietary systems in tasks spanning visual
question-answering, medical report generation, and complex reasoning in
multilingual and rare disease scenarios. By open-sourcing our complete
pipeline, we establish that high-performance medical VLM can be achieved
transparently, providing a foundational tool for accessible and impactful
clinical AI. Code is released on

intelligence, yet they are typically studied in isolation. We present Puffin, a
unified camera-centric multimodal model that extends spatial awareness along
the camera dimension. Puffin integrates language regression and diffusion-based
generation to interpret and create scenes from arbitrary viewpoints. To bridge
the modality gap between cameras and vision-language, we introduce a novel
paradigm that treats camera as language, enabling thinking with camera. This
guides the model to align spatially grounded visual cues with photographic
terminology while reasoning across geometric context. Puffin is trained on
Puffin-4M, a large-scale dataset of 4 million vision-language-camera triplets.
We incorporate both global camera parameters and pixel-wise camera maps,
yielding flexible and reliable spatial generation. Experiments demonstrate
Puffin superior performance over specialized models for camera-centric
generation and understanding. With instruction tuning, Puffin generalizes to
diverse cross-view tasks such as spatial imagination, world exploration, and
photography guidance. We will release the code, models, dataset pipeline, and
benchmark to advance multimodal spatial intelligence research.

### [15] [Structured Output Regularization: a framework for few-shot transfer learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08728)
*Nicolas Ewen,Jairo Diaz-Rodriguez,Kelly Ramsay*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了结构化输出正则化(SOR)框架，通过冻结网络内部结构并使用组套索和L1惩罚，在少样本医学影像分类任务中取得竞争性结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统迁移学习冻结预训练网络权重并添加任务特定层，虽然计算高效但限制了模型适应领域特定特征的能力，在数据有限时仍容易过拟合。

Method: SOR框架冻结内部网络结构(如卷积滤波器)，同时使用组套索和L1惩罚的组合，以最少的额外参数为特定数据定制模型。

Result: 在三个少样本医学影像分类任务中，使用DenseNet121和EfficientNetB4基础网络，相比现有基准取得了竞争性结果。

Conclusion: SOR是一个简单有效的框架，可广泛应用于各种网络组件，为迁移学习任务提供了广泛的适用性。

Abstract: Traditional transfer learning typically reuses large pre-trained networks by
freezing some of their weights and adding task-specific layers. While this
approach is computationally efficient, it limits the model's ability to adapt
to domain-specific features and can still lead to overfitting with very limited
data. To address these limitations, we propose Structured Output Regularization
(SOR), a simple yet effective framework that freezes the internal network
structures (e.g., convolutional filters) while using a combination of group
lasso and $L_1$ penalties. This framework tailors the model to specific data
with minimal additional parameters and is easily applicable to various network
components, such as convolutional filters or various blocks in neural networks
enabling broad applicability for transfer learning tasks. We evaluate SOR on
three few shot medical imaging classification tasks and we achieve competitive
results using DenseNet121, and EfficientNetB4 bases compared to established
benchmarks.

Motivation: 现有基准测试主要关注特定领域如规划或空间理解，缺乏对多模态大语言模型具身能力的系统性和全面性评估。

Method: 提出BEAR基准测试，包含4,469个跨模态条目，涵盖6个类别14个领域的具身能力评估。同时开发BEAR-Agent，集成预训练视觉模型来增强MLLM的感知、3D理解和规划能力。

Result: 对20个代表性MLLM的评估显示它们在所有具身能力领域都存在持续局限。BEAR-Agent显著提升了MLLM在BEAR上的表现，获得9.12%的绝对增益和17.5%的相对改进。

Conclusion: 提升MLLM的具身能力可以有益于模拟环境中的具身任务，BEAR基准测试为系统评估和提升MLLM的具身能力提供了重要工具。

Abstract: Embodied capabilities refer to a suite of fundamental abilities for an agent
to perceive, comprehend, and interact with the physical world. While multimodal
large language models (MLLMs) show promise as embodied agents, a thorough and
systematic evaluation of their embodied capabilities remains underexplored, as
existing benchmarks primarily focus on specific domains such as planning or
spatial understanding. To bridge this gap, we introduce BEAR, a comprehensive
and fine-grained benchmark that evaluates MLLMs on atomic embodied
capabilities. BEAR comprises 4,469 interleaved image-video-text entries across
14 domains in 6 categories, including tasks from low-level pointing, trajectory
understanding, spatial reasoning, to high-level planning. Extensive evaluation
results of 20 representative MLLMs reveal their persistent limitations across
all domains of embodied capabilities. To tackle the shortfall, we propose
BEAR-Agent, a multimodal conversable agent that integrates pretrained vision
models to strengthen MLLM perception, 3D understanding, and planning
capabilities. It substantially enhances MLLM performance across diverse
embodied capabilities on BEAR, yielding a 9.12% absolute gain and a relative
improvement of 17.5% on GPT-5. Furthermore, our experiments indicate that
improving MLLM embodied capabilities can benefit embodied tasks in simulated
environments. Project website: https://bear-official66.github.io/

*Jiayang Liu,Daniel Tso,Yiming Bu,Qinru Qiu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种基于生物视觉机制（中央凹-外周处理、眼跳运动、皮层填充）的对抗防御框架，通过强化学习引导的眼跳选择性采样多视角图像，在分类前重建图像以消除对抗噪声，无需重新训练下游分类器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统对抗防御方法依赖计算密集型优化，而人类视觉系统通过进化机制天然具有对抗扰动的鲁棒性。假设注意力引导的非均匀稀疏采样和预测编码是这种鲁棒性的关键。

Method: 结合三种生物机制：中央凹-外周处理、眼跳运动和皮层填充。使用强化学习引导的眼跳选择性捕获多个中央凹-外周视角，将这些视角整合成重建图像后再进行分类。

Result: 在ImageNet数据集上的实验表明，该方法提高了系统对不同分类器和攻击类型的鲁棒性，同时显著减少了训练开销。

Conclusion: 生物启发的预处理方法能有效缓解对抗噪声，保持语义完整性，且无需重新训练或微调下游分类器，可与现有系统无缝集成。

Abstract: Adversarial attacks significantly challenge the safe deployment of deep
learning models, particularly in real-world applications. Traditional defenses
often rely on computationally intensive optimization (e.g., adversarial
training or data augmentation) to improve robustness, whereas the human visual
system achieves inherent robustness to adversarial perturbations through
evolved biological mechanisms. We hypothesize that attention guided
non-homogeneous sparse sampling and predictive coding plays a key role in this
robustness. To test this hypothesis, we propose a novel defense framework
incorporating three key biological mechanisms: foveal-peripheral processing,
saccadic eye movements, and cortical filling-in. Our approach employs
reinforcement learning-guided saccades to selectively capture multiple
foveal-peripheral glimpses, which are integrated into a reconstructed image
before classification. This biologically inspired preprocessing effectively
mitigates adversarial noise, preserves semantic integrity, and notably requires
no retraining or fine-tuning of downstream classifiers, enabling seamless
integration with existing systems. Experiments on the ImageNet dataset
demonstrate that our method improves system robustness across diverse
classifiers and attack types, while significantly reducing training overhead
compared to both biologically and non-biologically inspired defense techniques.

pretrained deep learning models with RGB and thermal imaging to classify spill
vs. no-spill scenarios across varied environments. Using a balanced binary
dataset (4,000 images), our experiments demonstrate the advantages of thermal
imaging in inference speed, accuracy, and model size. We achieve up to 100%
accuracy using lightweight models like VGG19 and NasNetMobile, with thermal
models performing faster and more robustly across different lighting
conditions. Our system runs on consumer-grade hardware (RTX 4080) and achieves
inference times as low as 44 ms with model sizes under 350 MB, highlighting its
deployability in safety-critical contexts. Results from experiments with a real
robot and test datasets indicate that a VGG19 model trained on thermal imaging
performs best.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LinearSR是一个基于线性注意力的图像超分辨率框架，通过解决训练不稳定性和感知-失真权衡问题，首次实现了线性注意力在真实感超分辨率中的有效应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式图像超分辨率模型依赖自注意力的二次复杂度(O(N^2))，造成计算瓶颈。线性注意力提供O(N)解决方案，但历史上因一系列相互关联的未解决问题而未能充分发挥潜力。

Method: 1. 使用基于"拐点"的早期停止引导微调(ESGF)策略解决训练不稳定性；2. 采用基于SNR的专家混合(MoE)架构缓解感知-失真权衡；3. 建立基于"精度优先于数量"原则的轻量级引导范式TAG。

Result: LinearSR同时实现了最先进的感知质量和卓越效率。其核心扩散前向传播(1-NFE)达到SOTA级速度，整体多步推理时间保持高度竞争力。

Conclusion: 这项工作首次为在真实感超分辨率领域应用线性注意力提供了稳健方法，为高效生成式超分辨率的未来研究建立了基础范式。

Abstract: Generative models for Image Super-Resolution (SR) are increasingly powerful,
yet their reliance on self-attention's quadratic complexity (O(N^2)) creates a
major computational bottleneck. Linear Attention offers an O(N) solution, but
its promise for photorealistic SR has remained largely untapped, historically
hindered by a cascade of interrelated and previously unsolved challenges. This
paper introduces LinearSR, a holistic framework that, for the first time,
systematically overcomes these critical hurdles. Specifically, we resolve a
fundamental, training instability that causes catastrophic model divergence
using our novel "knee point"-based Early-Stopping Guided Fine-tuning (ESGF)
strategy. Furthermore, we mitigate the classic perception-distortion trade-off
with a dedicated SNR-based Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture. Finally, we
establish an effective and lightweight guidance paradigm, TAG, derived from our
"precision-over-volume" principle. Our resulting LinearSR model simultaneously
delivers state-of-the-art perceptual quality with exceptional efficiency. Its
core diffusion forward pass (1-NFE) achieves SOTA-level speed, while its
overall multi-step inference time remains highly competitive. This work
provides the first robust methodology for applying Linear Attention in the
photorealistic SR domain, establishing a foundational paradigm for future
research in efficient generative super-resolution.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统野生动物监测方法（如鸟类腿环标记）耗时且具有侵入性，需要开发非侵入式、高效的自动化识别方案来改进种群监测。

Method: 结合YOLO和Grounding DINO进行目标检测，使用光流模糊检测、DINOv2图像编码和聚类方法，从定制喂食器的视频中提取代表性关键帧。

Result: 所提出的关键帧选择方法在kākā重识别任务中实现了高精度，为在更复杂环境中使用媒体数据提供了基础。

Conclusion: 这种基于AI和计算机视觉的非侵入式方法为野生动物监测提供了有价值的替代方案，有助于生态学和保护生物学的新方法发展。

Abstract: Accurate recognition and re-identification of individual animals is essential
for successful wildlife population monitoring. Traditional methods, such as leg
banding of birds, are time consuming and invasive. Recent progress in
artificial intelligence, particularly computer vision, offers encouraging
solutions for smart conservation and efficient automation. This study presents
a unique pipeline for extracting high-quality key frames from videos of
k\={a}k\={a} (Nestor meridionalis), a threatened forest-dwelling parrot in New
Zealand. Key frame extraction is well-studied in person re-identification,
however, its application to wildlife is limited. Using video recordings at a
custom-built feeder, we extract key frames and evaluate the re-identification
performance of our pipeline. Our unsupervised methodology combines object
detection using YOLO and Grounding DINO, optical flow blur detection, image
encoding with DINOv2, and clustering methods to identify representative key
frames. The results indicate that our proposed key frame selection methods
yield image collections which achieve high accuracy in k\={a}k\={a}
re-identification, providing a foundation for future research using media
collected in more diverse and challenging environments. Through the use of
artificial intelligence and computer vision, our non-invasive and efficient
approach provides a valuable alternative to traditional physical tagging
methods for recognising k\={a}k\={a} individuals and therefore improving the
monitoring of populations. This research contributes to developing fresh
approaches in wildlife monitoring, with applications in ecology and
conservation biology.

*Shuo Xing,Soumik Dey,Mingyang Wu,Ashirbad Mishra,Hansi Wu,Binbin Li,Zhengzhong Tu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Q-Router是一个基于多层级模型路由的智能视频质量评估框架，通过视觉语言模型动态选择和集成专家模型，解决了现有VQA模型泛化性差、可解释性弱和扩展性不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频质量评估模型存在泛化能力差（难以适应UGC、短视频、AIGC等多样化内容）、可解释性有限以及缺乏对新用例或内容类型的扩展性等问题。

Method: 提出Q-Router框架，集成多种专家模型，使用视觉语言模型作为实时路由器，根据输入视频语义动态推理并集成最合适的专家模型。构建基于计算预算的多层级路由系统，最重层级包含特定的时空伪影定位以增强可解释性。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，Q-Router达到或超越了最先进的VQA模型性能，显著提高了泛化能力和可解释性。在Q-Bench-Video基准测试中表现出色，并能够有效定位时空伪影，展示了作为视频生成模型后训练奖励函数的潜力。

Conclusion: Q-Router通过智能路由机制结合专家模型的互补优势，实现了跨异构视频源和任务的灵活性和鲁棒性，有望成为下一代VQA系统的基础框架。

Abstract: Video quality assessment (VQA) is a fundamental computer vision task that
aims to predict the perceptual quality of a given video in alignment with human
judgments. Existing performant VQA models trained with direct score supervision
suffer from (1) poor generalization across diverse content and tasks, ranging
from user-generated content (UGC), short-form videos, to AI-generated content
(AIGC), (2) limited interpretability, and (3) lack of extensibility to novel
use cases or content types. We propose Q-Router, an agentic framework for
universal VQA with a multi-tier model routing system. Q-Router integrates a
diverse set of expert models and employs vision--language models (VLMs) as
real-time routers that dynamically reason and then ensemble the most
appropriate experts conditioned on the input video semantics. We build a
multi-tiered routing system based on the computing budget, with the heaviest
tier involving a specific spatiotemporal artifacts localization for
interpretability. This agentic design enables Q-Router to combine the
complementary strengths of specialized experts, achieving both flexibility and
robustness in delivering consistent performance across heterogeneous video
sources and tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Q-Router matches or
surpasses state-of-the-art VQA models on a variety of benchmarks, while
substantially improving generalization and interpretability. Moreover, Q-Router
excels on the quality-based question answering benchmark, Q-Bench-Video,
highlighting its promise as a foundation for next-generation VQA systems.
Finally, we show that Q-Router capably localizes spatiotemporal artifacts,
showing potential as a reward function for post-training video generation
models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Med-VQA方法在模态对齐、硬负样本处理和知识融合方面存在不足，缺乏统一解决方案且可能引入无关信息。

Method: 1) 多层级模态对齐的统一方案；2) 使用软标签的硬负样本挖掘方法；3) 集成答案词汇表作为先验知识的门控交叉注意力模块。

Result: 在RAD-VQA、SLAKE、PathVQA和VQA-2019等广泛使用的Med-VQA数据集上超越了之前的最先进方法。

Conclusion: 该框架通过解决模态对齐、硬负样本和知识融合等关键挑战，显著提升了Med-VQA任务的性能。

Abstract: Medical Visual Question Answering (Med-VQA) is a challenging task that
requires a deep understanding of both medical images and textual questions.
Although recent works leveraging Medical Vision-Language Pre-training (Med-VLP)
have shown strong performance on the Med-VQA task, there is still no unified
solution for modality alignment, and the issue of hard negatives remains
under-explored. Additionally, commonly used knowledge fusion techniques for
Med-VQA may introduce irrelevant information. In this work, we propose a
framework to address these challenges through three key contributions: (1) a
unified solution for heterogeneous modality alignments across multiple levels,
modalities, views, and stages, leveraging methods like contrastive learning and
optimal transport theory; (2) a hard negative mining method that employs soft
labels for multi-modality alignments and enforces the hard negative pair
discrimination; and (3) a Gated Cross-Attention Module for Med-VQA that
integrates the answer vocabulary as prior knowledge and selects relevant
information from it. Our framework outperforms the previous state-of-the-art on
widely used Med-VQA datasets like RAD-VQA, SLAKE, PathVQA and VQA-2019.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SkipSR是一个加速视频超分辨率的方法，通过识别低细节区域并跳过计算，仅对需要细化的区域进行超分辨率处理，在保持感知质量的同时显著减少计算量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于扩散的超分辨率方法在处理视频时计算成本高且速度慢，限制了向更高分辨率和更长视频的扩展。许多视频区域本质上是低细节的，从细化中获益甚微，但现有方法对所有像素进行统一处理。

Method: 提出SkipSR框架，直接从低分辨率输入中识别低细节区域，然后完全跳过这些区域的计算，仅对需要细化的区域进行超分辨率处理。

Result: 在标准SR基准测试中，该方法在720p视频上比现有模型实现了高达60%的端到端延迟减少，且没有可感知的质量损失。

Conclusion: SkipSR是一种简单而有效的策略，在保持感知质量的同时显著减少了基于扩散的视频超分辨率计算量。

Abstract: Diffusion-based super-resolution (SR) is a key component in video generation
and video restoration, but is slow and expensive, limiting scalability to
higher resolutions and longer videos. Our key insight is that many regions in
video are inherently low-detail and gain little from refinement, yet current
methods process all pixels uniformly. To take advantage of this, we propose
SkipSR, a simple framework for accelerating video SR by identifying low-detail
regions directly from low-resolution input, then skipping computation on them
entirely, only super-resolving the areas that require refinement. This simple
yet effective strategy preserves perceptual quality in both standard and
one-step diffusion SR models while significantly reducing computation. In
standard SR benchmarks, our method achieves up to 60% faster end-to-end latency
than prior models on 720p videos with no perceptible loss in quality. Video
demos are available at https://rccchoudhury.github.io/skipsr/

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将图像预训练的视觉语言模型扩展到视频领域面临挑战，因为需要处理密集且时间延长的视觉输入，这超出了基于图像模型的能力。论文识别了感知瓶颈和token过载作为关键挑战。

Method: 提出D-CoDe框架，包含动态压缩（自适应选择代表性帧和内容感知的空间token聚合）和问题分解（将原始查询重新表述为子问题）。

Result: 实验表明D-CoDe有效提升了各种基准测试中的视频理解能力，在具有挑战性的长视频基准上表现出色。

Conclusion: D-CoDe展示了处理复杂视频-语言任务的潜力，无需训练即可有效解决视频理解中的关键挑战。

Abstract: Video large language models (Vid-LLMs), which excel in diverse video-language
tasks, can be effectively constructed by adapting image-pretrained
vision-language models (VLMs). However, this adaptation remains challenging, as
it requires processing dense and temporally extended visual inputs that exceed
the capacity of image-based models. This paper identifies the perception
bottleneck and token overload as key challenges in extending image-based VLMs
to the video domain. To address these issues, we propose D-CoDe, a
training-free adaptation framework that incorporates dynamic compression and
question decomposition. Specifically, dynamic compression alleviates the
perception bottleneck through adaptive selection of representative frames and
content-aware aggregation of spatial tokens, thereby reducing redundancy while
preserving informative content. In parallel, question decomposition mitigates
token overload by reformulating the original query into sub-questions, guiding
the model to focus on distinct aspects of the video and enabling more
comprehensive understanding. Experiments demonstrate that D-CoDe effectively
improves video understanding across various benchmarks. Furthermore, strong
performance on the challenging long-video benchmark highlights the potential of
D-CoDe in handling complex video-language tasks. Code is available at

TL;DR: 提出FOLK方法，通过标签引导的知识蒸馏实现快速开放词汇3D实例分割，避免2D映射带来的噪声和计算开销，显著提升推理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将3D实例映射到2D RGB-D图像，然后使用视觉语言模型分类，但这种方法会引入2D遮挡噪声，且推理时计算和内存成本高，速度慢。

Method: 设计教师模型提取高质量实例嵌入，通过标签引导的蒸馏算法将开放词汇知识蒸馏到3D学生模型中，学生模型可直接从点云分类实例。

Result: 在ScanNet200数据集上达到35.7的AP50分数，运行速度比之前方法快6.0倍到152.2倍。

Conclusion: FOLK方法通过知识蒸馏有效解决了开放词汇3D实例分割中的噪声和效率问题，实现了高性能和高效率的平衡。

Abstract: Open-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation seeks to segment and classify
instances beyond the annotated label space. Existing methods typically map 3D
instances to 2D RGB-D images, and then employ vision-language models (VLMs) for
classification. However, such a mapping strategy usually introduces noise from
2D occlusions and incurs substantial computational and memory costs during
inference, slowing down the inference speed. To address the above problems, we
propose a Fast Open-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation method via Label-guided
Knowledge distillation (FOLK). Our core idea is to design a teacher model that
extracts high-quality instance embeddings and distills its open-vocabulary
knowledge into a 3D student model. In this way, during inference, the distilled
3D model can directly classify instances from the 3D point cloud, avoiding
noise caused by occlusions and significantly accelerating the inference
process. Specifically, we first design a teacher model to generate a 2D CLIP
embedding for each 3D instance, incorporating both visibility and viewpoint
diversity, which serves as the learning target for distillation. We then
develop a 3D student model that directly produces a 3D embedding for each 3D
instance. During training, we propose a label-guided distillation algorithm to
distill open-vocabulary knowledge from label-consistent 2D embeddings into the
student model. FOLK conducted experiments on the ScanNet200 and Replica
datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance on the ScanNet200 dataset with
an AP50 score of 35.7, while running approximately 6.0x to 152.2x faster than
previous methods. All codes will be released after the paper is accepted.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 蔓越莓生长监测目前主要依赖人工，耗时且效率低。深度学习虽有潜力但面临高维特征难以解释和需要大量标注的问题。

Method: 使用自监督方法微调视觉变换器，通过时间回归和类别预测的双重预训练任务学习植物和果实外观的时间演化潜在空间。

Result: 生成了可解释的2D时间轨迹，能够预测生长过程并区分不同蔓越莓品种的时间差异，同时提供了包含8个品种、52次观测的新时间序列数据集。

Conclusion: 该方法通用性强，可应用于其他作物和场景，解决了传统监测方法效率低和深度学习需要大量标注的问题。

Abstract: Change monitoring is an essential task for cranberry farming as it provides
both breeders and growers with the ability to analyze growth, predict yield,
and make treatment decisions. However, this task is often done manually,
requiring significant time on the part of a cranberry grower or breeder. Deep
learning based change monitoring holds promise, despite the caveat of
hard-to-interpret high dimensional features and hand-annotations for
fine-tuning. To address this gap, we introduce a method for modeling crop
growth based on fine-tuning vision transformers (ViTs) using a self-supervised
approach that avoids tedious image annotations. We use a two-fold pretext task
(time regression and class prediction) to learn a latent space for the
time-lapse evolution of plant and fruit appearance. The resulting 2D temporal
tracks provide an interpretable time-series model of crop growth that can be
used to: 1) predict growth over time and 2) distinguish temporal differences of
cranberry varieties. We also provide a novel time-lapse dataset of cranberry
fruit featuring eight distinct varieties, observed 52 times over the growing
season (span of around four months), annotated with information about fungicide
application, yield, and rot. Our approach is general and can be applied to
other crops and applications (code and dataset can be found at https://github.

*Daiki Yoshikawa,Takashi Matsubara*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PHyCLIP提出了一种在双曲空间乘积上使用ℓ₁-乘积度量的方法，同时捕捉概念族内的层次结构和跨概念族的组合性，在多个任务上优于现有单空间方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉语言模型难以同时表达概念族内的层次结构（如狗⊑哺乳动物⊑动物）和跨概念族的组合性（如"车里的狗"⊑狗,车），双曲空间虽能有效捕捉层次结构，但对组合性的表示能力尚不明确。

Method: PHyCLIP在双曲因子的笛卡尔积上使用ℓ₁-乘积度量，概念族内层次结构在单个双曲因子中形成，跨概念族组合通过ℓ₁-乘积度量捕获，类似于布尔代数。

Result: 在零样本分类、检索、层次分类和组合理解任务上的实验表明，PHyCLIP优于现有的单空间方法，并在嵌入空间中提供了更可解释的结构。

Conclusion: PHyCLIP通过双曲空间的乘积结构成功解决了同时表示层次结构和组合性的挑战，为多模态表示学习提供了更强大的框架。

Abstract: Vision-language models have achieved remarkable success in multi-modal

descriptions. However, they still struggle to simultaneously express two
distinct types of semantic structures: the hierarchy within a concept family
(e.g., dog $\preceq$ mammal $\preceq$ animal) and the compositionality across
different concept families (e.g., "a dog in a car" $\preceq$ dog, car). Recent
works have addressed this challenge by employing hyperbolic space, which
efficiently captures tree-like hierarchy, yet its suitability for representing
compositionality remains unclear. To resolve this dilemma, we propose PHyCLIP,
which employs an $\ell_1$-Product metric on a Cartesian product of Hyperbolic
factors. With our design, intra-family hierarchies emerge within individual
hyperbolic factors, and cross-family composition is captured by the
$\ell_1$-product metric, analogous to a Boolean algebra. Experiments on
zero-shot classification, retrieval, hierarchical classification, and
compositional understanding tasks demonstrate that PHyCLIP outperforms existing
single-space approaches and offers more interpretable structures in the
embedding space.

TL;DR: 提出SegTrans框架，通过分割输入样本为多个局部区域并重映射语义信息来增强对抗样本的跨模型迁移性，显著提高分割模型的对抗攻击成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有分割模型对抗攻击方法在跨模型迁移时效果不佳，主要由于模型间复杂的上下文依赖性和特征分布差异导致迁移成功率低。

Method: 将输入样本分割为多个局部区域，重映射其语义信息生成多样化增强样本，用这些样本替代原始样本进行扰动优化，仅保留局部语义信息而非全局信息。

Result: 在PASCAL VOC和Cityscapes数据集上，对四种分割模型和三种骨干网络的实验表明，SegTrans显著提高了对抗迁移成功率，平均提升8.55%，计算效率提升超过100%。

Conclusion: SegTrans框架有效解决了分割模型对抗攻击的跨模型迁移问题，在不增加计算开销的情况下显著提高了攻击成功率和效率。

Abstract: Segmentation models exhibit significant vulnerability to adversarial examples
in white-box settings, but existing adversarial attack methods often show poor
transferability across different segmentation models. While some researchers
have explored transfer-based adversarial attack (i.e., transfer attack) methods
for segmentation models, the complex contextual dependencies within these
models and the feature distribution gaps between surrogate and target models
result in unsatisfactory transfer success rates. To address these issues, we
propose SegTrans, a novel transfer attack framework that divides the input
sample into multiple local regions and remaps their semantic information to
generate diverse enhanced samples. These enhanced samples replace the original
ones for perturbation optimization, thereby improving the transferability of
adversarial examples across different segmentation models. Unlike existing
methods, SegTrans only retains local semantic information from the original
input, rather than using global semantic information to optimize perturbations.
Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets, PASCAL VOC and Cityscapes,
four different segmentation models, and three backbone networks show that
SegTrans significantly improves adversarial transfer success rates without
introducing additional computational overhead. Compared to the current
state-of-the-art methods, SegTrans achieves an average increase of 8.55% in
transfer attack success rate and improves computational efficiency by more than
100%.

TL;DR: 提出ASVP方法保护图像恢复模型免受知识蒸馏攻击，通过在内部特征图中放大topk奇异值来注入结构化高频扰动，破坏蒸馏过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 知识蒸馏攻击威胁深度模型知识产权，现有防御方法在图像分类中有效但难以扩展到图像恢复任务，因为恢复任务是生成式任务，具有连续高维输出，需要空间一致性和细节保持。

Method: ASVP方法在运行时对教师模型的内部特征图进行奇异值分解，放大前k个奇异值来注入结构化高频扰动，破坏学生模型学习所需的对齐关系。

Result: 在五个图像恢复任务上评估，ASVP可将学生模型的PSNR降低最多4dB，SSIM降低60-75%，对教师模型性能影响可忽略。

Conclusion: ASVP为保护开源图像恢复模型免受未经授权的知识蒸馏攻击提供了实用解决方案，相比现有方法提供更强更一致的防御效果。

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) attacks pose a significant threat to deep model
intellectual property by enabling adversaries to train student networks using a
teacher model's outputs. While recent defenses in image classification have
successfully disrupted KD by perturbing output probabilities, extending these
methods to image restoration is difficult. Unlike classification, restoration
is a generative task with continuous, high-dimensional outputs that depend on
spatial coherence and fine details. Minor perturbations are often insufficient,
as students can still learn the underlying mapping.To address this, we propose
Adaptive Singular Value Perturbation (ASVP), a runtime defense tailored for
image restoration models. ASVP operates on internal feature maps of the teacher
using singular value decomposition (SVD). It amplifies the topk singular values
to inject structured, high-frequency perturbations, disrupting the alignment
needed for distillation. This hinders student learning while preserving the
teacher's output quality.We evaluate ASVP across five image restoration tasks:
super-resolution, low-light enhancement, underwater enhancement, dehazing, and
deraining. Experiments show ASVP reduces student PSNR by up to 4 dB and SSIM by
60-75%, with negligible impact on the teacher's performance. Compared to prior
methods, ASVP offers a stronger and more consistent defense.Our approach
provides a practical solution to protect open-source restoration models from
unauthorized knowledge distillation.

Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在视频理解任务中表现出色，但其在面对被操纵视频内容时的鲁棒性尚未得到充分研究。

Method: 通过编辑风格、物体、背景及其组合来创建高质量、多样化且时间相关的反事实视频数据集，构建Ro-Bench基准测试，并评估了8个最新的视频MLLMs。

Result: 当前模型在反事实视频内容上表现出显著的性能下降，但通过反事实数据微调，在Ro-Bench上性能提升21.73%，在MVBench数据集的20个任务中提升12.78%。

Conclusion: 反事实数据能有效增强MLLMs的视频理解能力，强调了评估和改进模型鲁棒性的重要性。

Abstract: Recently, Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated
significant performance across various video understanding tasks. However,
their robustness, particularly when faced with manipulated video content,
remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we introduce Ro-Bench, the first
benchmark for evaluating MLLMs on dynamic out-of-distribution (OOD)
counterfactual video test sets. Ro-Bench incorporates high-quality, diverse and
temporally relevant video data, by editing Style, Object, Background and their
compositions. We evaluated eight recent video MLLMs and found that current
models exhibit substantial performance degradation on Ro-Bench when exposed to
counterfactual video content. Furthermore, we demonstrate that fine-tuning
MLLMs with counterfactual data enhances robustness, achieving a 21.73%
performance increase on Ro-Bench and a 12.78% improvement across 20 tasks in
the MVBench dataset. These findings underscore the effectiveness of
counterfactual data in enhancing the video understanding ability of MLLMs. The

Method: 开发对象聚焦数据增强框架，分割动物与背景，通过变换和基于扩散的合成技术创建真实多样的场景，提升动物检测和监测性能。

Result: 初步实验表明，增强后的数据集在动物检测任务上相比基线模型表现更优。

Conclusion: 该方法通过生成领域特定数据，在数据稀缺场景下赋能实时动物健康监测解决方案，弥合有限数据与实际应用之间的差距。

Abstract: Modern agricultural operations increasingly rely on integrated monitoring
systems that combine multiple data sources for farm optimization. Aerial
drone-based animal health monitoring serves as a key component but faces
limited data availability, compounded by scene-specific issues such as small,
occluded, or partially visible animals. Transfer learning approaches often fail
to address this limitation due to the unavailability of large datasets that
reflect specific farm conditions, including variations in animal breeds,
environments, and behaviors. Therefore, there is a need for developing a
problem-specific, animal-focused data augmentation strategy tailored to these
unique challenges. To address this gap, we propose an object-focused data
augmentation framework designed explicitly for animal health monitoring in
constrained data settings. Our approach segments animals from backgrounds and
augments them through transformations and diffusion-based synthesis to create
realistic, diverse scenes that enhance animal detection and monitoring
performance. Our initial experiments demonstrate that our augmented dataset
yields superior performance compared to our baseline models on the animal
detection task. By generating domain-specific data, our method empowers
real-time animal health monitoring solutions even in data-scarce scenarios,
bridging the gap between limited data and practical applicability.

TL;DR: 本文提出了Perception-Time Scaling (PTS)新范式，通过分解复杂感知问题为中间可处理子问题，显著提升大视觉语言模型在视觉感知任务中的精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大视觉语言模型在推理时间扩展方面取得进展，但对视觉感知的影响尚不明确。研究发现当前模型采用快速感知范式，将视觉理解视为一次性输出，限制了感知精度。

Method: 提出PTS范式，鼓励丰富的token感知，将复杂感知问题分解为中间可处理的子问题，并结合强化学习技术。

Result: PTS将DisTANCE基准上的高精度性能从8.0%提升至64.7%，在领域外任务上泛化良好，即使使用纯合成数据也能提升数学推理和真实世界感知能力。

Conclusion: PTS通过增加感知相关token和提升模型对图像token的关注度，有效解决了当前LVLMs感知精度有限的问题，为视觉感知任务提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in inference-time scaling, particularly those leveraging
reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards, have substantially enhanced the
reasoning capabilities of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). Inspired by
this success, similar strategies have been applied to multimodal reasoning, yet
their impact on visual perception remains unclear. To investigate this gap, we
introduce DisTANCE, a perception-centric benchmark for visual estimation tasks.
Evaluation results show that LVLMs exhibit limited estimation precision, and
inference-time scaling offers only marginal gains. We attribute this to the
fast perception paradigm of current LVLMs, where visual understanding is
treated as a one-shot output without modeling the underlying perceptual
process. To address this, we propose Perception-Time Scaling (PTS), a novel
paradigm that encourages token-rich perception and decomposes complex
perception problems into intermediate tractable sub-problems, thereby enabling
perception to align with and benefit from inference-time scaling. Combined with
reinforcement learning techniques, PTS significantly improves perception
accuracy, raising high-precision performance on DisTANCE from 8.0% to 64.7%,
and generalizes well to out-of-domain tasks. Surprisingly, even though PTS data
are purely synthetic, combining them with math reasoning data yields consistent
gains in both reasoning and real-world perception benchmarks. Further analysis
reveals that PTS introduces more perception-related tokens and increases the
model's attention to image tokens. Our code and data will be publicly released.

TL;DR: mmJoints框架通过为预训练的毫米波3D姿态估计器输出添加关节描述符，显式表示统计先验偏差，提高下游任务性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 毫米波姿态估计中稀疏信号和弱反射导致模型过度依赖统计先验而非传感器数据，这降低了手势和活动识别等下游任务的性能

Method: 在预训练的黑盒毫米波3D姿态估计器输出基础上，添加估计关节被感知的可能性和预测位置可靠性的额外关节描述符

Result: 在13种姿态估计设置下使用115,000多个信号帧评估，描述符估计错误率低于4.2%，关节位置精度提升12.5%，活动识别性能提升16%

Conclusion: 通过显式表示统计先验偏差而非缓解它，mmJoints提高了姿态估计的可解释性和下游任务准确性

Abstract: In mmWave-based pose estimation, sparse signals and weak reflections often
cause models to infer body joints from statistical priors rather than sensor
data. While prior knowledge helps in learning meaningful representations,
over-reliance on it degrades performance in downstream tasks like gesture and
activity recognition. In this paper, we introduce mmJoints, a framework that
augments a pre-trained, black-box mmWave-based 3D pose estimator's output with
additional joint descriptors. Rather than mitigating bias, mmJoints makes it
explicit by estimating the likelihood of a joint being sensed and the
reliability of its predicted location. These descriptors enhance
interpretability and improve downstream task accuracy. Through extensive
evaluations using over 115,000 signal frames across 13 pose estimation
settings, we show that mmJoints estimates descriptors with an error rate below
4.2%. mmJoints also improves joint position accuracy by up to 12.5% and boosts
activity recognition by up to 16% over state-of-the-art methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到图像模型在复杂局部区域（特别是人手）生成准确细节方面仍有困难，而手部质量评估被忽视，限制了人像生成质量优化和AIGC检测等下游任务性能。

Method: 构建HandPair数据集（4.8万张高质量-低质量手部图像对），开发HandEval模型，结合多模态大语言模型的视觉理解能力和手部关键点先验知识。

Result: HandEval与人类判断更一致，集成到图像生成和AIGC检测流程中分别显著提升了生成手部真实感和检测准确率。

Conclusion: 提出的手部质量评估方法在多个下游应用中展现出普遍有效性，为提升生成图像质量和AIGC检测提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Although recent text-to-image (T2I) models have significantly improved the
overall visual quality of generated images, they still struggle in the
generation of accurate details in complex local regions, especially human
hands. Generated hands often exhibit structural distortions and unrealistic
textures, which can be very noticeable even when the rest of the body is
well-generated. However, the quality assessment of hand regions remains largely
neglected, limiting downstream task performance like human-centric generation
quality optimization and AIGC detection. To address this, we propose the first
quality assessment task targeting generated hand regions and showcase its
abundant downstream applications. We first introduce the HandPair dataset for
training hand quality assessment models. It consists of 48k images formed by
high- and low-quality hand pairs, enabling low-cost, efficient supervision
without manual annotation. Based on it, we develop HandEval, a carefully
designed hand-specific quality assessment model. It leverages the powerful
visual understanding capability of Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) and
incorporates prior knowledge of hand keypoints, gaining strong perception of
hand quality. We further construct a human-annotated test set with hand images
from various state-of-the-art (SOTA) T2I models to validate its quality
evaluation capability. Results show that HandEval aligns better with human
judgments than existing SOTA methods. Furthermore, we integrate HandEval into
image generation and AIGC detection pipelines, prominently enhancing generated
hand realism and detection accuracy, respectively, confirming its universal
effectiveness in downstream applications. Code and dataset will be available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI上色技术虽然能生成逼真的彩色图像，但存在版权侵权风险，如未经授权对黑白漫画和电影进行上色并转售。目前缺乏有效的防范方法。

Method: 提出PAChroma方法，通过拉普拉斯滤波器优化不可察觉的扰动以保持感知质量，并在优化过程中应用多样化的输入变换来增强跨模型迁移性和对常见后处理的鲁棒性。

Result: 在ImageNet和Danbooru数据集上的实验表明，PAChroma能有效降低上色质量，同时保持视觉外观不变。

Conclusion: 这是保护视觉内容免受非法AI上色的首个防御方法，为生成媒体中的版权保护防御开辟了新途径。

Abstract: AI-based colorization has shown remarkable capability in generating realistic
color images from grayscale inputs. However, it poses risks of copyright
infringement -- for example, the unauthorized colorization and resale of
monochrome manga and films. Despite these concerns, no effective method
currently exists to prevent such misuse. To address this, we introduce the
first defensive paradigm, Uncolorable Examples, which embed imperceptible
perturbations into grayscale images to invalidate unauthorized colorization. To
ensure real-world applicability, we establish four criteria: effectiveness,
imperceptibility, transferability, and robustness. Our method, Perception-Aware
Chroma-Restrictive Perturbation (PAChroma), generates Uncolorable Examples that
meet these four criteria by optimizing imperceptible perturbations with a
Laplacian filter to preserve perceptual quality, and applying diverse input
transformations during optimization to enhance transferability across models
and robustness against common post-processing (e.g., compression). Experiments
on ImageNet and Danbooru datasets demonstrate that PAChroma effectively
degrades colorization quality while maintaining the visual appearance. This
work marks the first step toward protecting visual content from illegitimate AI
colorization, paving the way for copyright-aware defenses in generative media.

Conclusion: SJD2框架成功地将去噪过程与Jacobi迭代相结合，实现了自回归模型的并行token生成，在保持图像质量的同时显著提升了生成效率。

Abstract: As a new paradigm of visual content generation, autoregressive text-to-image
models suffer from slow inference due to their sequential token-by-token
decoding process, often requiring thousands of model forward passes to generate
a single image. To address this inefficiency, we propose Speculative
Jacobi-Denoising Decoding (SJD2), a framework that incorporates the denoising
process into Jacobi iterations to enable parallel token generation in
autoregressive models. Our method introduces a next-clean-token prediction
paradigm that enables the pre-trained autoregressive models to accept
noise-perturbed token embeddings and predict the next clean tokens through
low-cost fine-tuning. This denoising paradigm guides the model towards more
stable Jacobi trajectories. During inference, our method initializes token
sequences with Gaussian noise and performs iterative
next-clean-token-prediction in the embedding space. We employ a probabilistic
criterion to verify and accept multiple tokens in parallel, and refine the
unaccepted tokens for the next iteration with the denoising trajectory.
Experiments show that our method can accelerate generation by reducing model
forward passes while maintaining the visual quality of generated images.

Method: 提出一种简单有效的方法：1）使用对抗扰动识别不确定视觉标记；2）在视觉编码器中间层的自注意力过程中掩码这些不确定标记，抑制其对视觉编码的影响。

Result: 大量实验表明，该方法显著减少了LVLMs中的物体幻觉，并能与其他现有方法协同工作。

Conclusion: 通过仅修改视觉编码器来识别和掩码不确定视觉标记，可以有效缓解物体幻觉问题，且该方法简单高效。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs), which integrate a vision encoder (VE)
with a large language model, have achieved remarkable success across various
tasks. However, there are still crucial challenges in LVLMs such as object
hallucination, generating descriptions of objects that are not in the input
image. Here, we argue that uncertain visual tokens within the VE is a key
factor that contributes to object hallucination. Our statistical analysis found
that there are positive correlations between visual tokens with high epistemic
uncertainty and the occurrence of hallucinations. Furthermore, we show
theoretically and empirically that visual tokens in early VE layers that
exhibit large representation deviations under small adversarial perturbations
indicate high epistemic uncertainty. Based on these findings, we propose a
simple yet effective strategy to mitigate object hallucination by modifying the
VE only. Our method comprises a proxy method with adversarial perturbations for
identifying uncertain visual tokens efficiently and a method to mask these
uncertain visual tokens during the self-attention process in the middle layers
of the VE, suppressing their influence on visual encoding and thus alleviating
hallucinations. Extensive experiments show that our method significantly
reduces object hallucinations in LVLMs and can synergistically work with other
prior arts.

Conclusion: 所提出的熵信息解码策略能够显著提升自回归图像生成的质量和效率，为AR图像生成提供了有效的采样优化方案。

Abstract: In this work, we first revisit the sampling issues in current autoregressive
(AR) image generation models and identify that image tokens, unlike text
tokens, exhibit lower information density and non-uniform spatial distribution.
Accordingly, we present an entropy-informed decoding strategy that facilitates
higher autoregressive generation quality with faster synthesis speed.
Specifically, the proposed method introduces two main innovations: 1) dynamic
temperature control guided by spatial entropy of token distributions, enhancing
the balance between content diversity, alignment accuracy, and structural
coherence in both mask-based and scale-wise models, without extra computational
overhead, and 2) entropy-aware acceptance rules in speculative decoding,
achieving near-lossless generation at about 85\% of the inference cost of
conventional acceleration methods. Extensive experiments across multiple
benchmarks using diverse AR image generation models demonstrate the
effectiveness and generalizability of our approach in enhancing both generation
quality and sampling speed.

Motivation: LiDAR标注存在噪声，且噪声在域偏移下会被放大，威胁系统可靠性。现有噪声标签学习方法在3D LiDAR分割中的域泛化问题尚未充分探索。

Method: 提出DuNe双视图框架，包含强分支和弱分支，通过特征级一致性约束和基于置信度过滤的交叉熵损失来处理噪声标签。

Result: 在10%对称标签噪声下，在SemanticKITTI上达到56.86% mIoU，nuScenes上42.28%，SemanticPOSS上52.58%，整体算术平均49.57%，调和平均48.50%。

Conclusion: DuNe框架在DGLSS-NL任务中表现出强大的域泛化能力，为解决LiDAR分割中的噪声标签问题提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Accurate perception is critical for vehicle safety, with LiDAR as a key
enabler in autonomous driving. To ensure robust performance across
environments, sensor types, and weather conditions without costly
re-annotation, domain generalization in LiDAR-based 3D semantic segmentation is
essential. However, LiDAR annotations are often noisy due to sensor
imperfections, occlusions, and human errors. Such noise degrades segmentation
accuracy and is further amplified under domain shifts, threatening system
reliability. While noisy-label learning is well-studied in images, its
extension to 3D LiDAR segmentation under domain generalization remains largely
unexplored, as the sparse and irregular structure of point clouds limits direct
use of 2D methods. To address this gap, we introduce the novel task Domain
Generalization for LiDAR Semantic Segmentation under Noisy Labels (DGLSS-NL)
and establish the first benchmark by adapting three representative noisy-label
learning strategies from image classification to 3D segmentation. However, we
find that existing noisy-label learning approaches adapt poorly to LiDAR data.
We therefore propose DuNe, a dual-view framework with strong and weak branches
that enforce feature-level consistency and apply cross-entropy loss based on
confidence-aware filtering of predictions. Our approach shows state-of-the-art
performance by achieving 56.86% mIoU on SemanticKITTI, 42.28% on nuScenes, and
52.58% on SemanticPOSS under 10% symmetric label noise, with an overall
Arithmetic Mean (AM) of 49.57% and Harmonic Mean (HM) of 48.50%, thereby
demonstrating robust domain generalization in DGLSS-NL tasks. The code is

Abstract: Image-to-Image translation models can help mitigate various challenges
inherent to medical image acquisition. Latent diffusion models (LDMs) leverage
efficient learning in compressed latent space and constitute the core of
state-of-the-art generative image models. However, this efficiency comes with a
trade-off, potentially compromising crucial pixel-level detail essential for
high-fidelity medical images. This limitation becomes particularly critical
when generating clinically significant structures, such as lesions, which often
occupy only a small portion of the image. Failure to accurately reconstruct
these regions can severely impact diagnostic reliability and clinical
decision-making. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel post-training
framework for LDMs in medical image-to-image translation by incorporating
lesion-aware medical pixel space objectives. This approach is essential, as it
not only enhances overall image quality but also improves the precision of
lesion delineation. We evaluate our framework on brain CT-to-MRI translation in
acute ischemic stroke patients, where early and accurate diagnosis is critical
for optimal treatment selection and improved patient outcomes. While diffusion
MRI is the gold standard for stroke diagnosis, its clinical utility is often
constrained by high costs and low accessibility. Using a dataset of 817
patients, we demonstrate that our framework improves overall image quality and
enhances lesion delineation when synthesizing DWI and ADC images from CT
perfusion scans, outperforming existing image-to-image translation models.
Furthermore, our post-training strategy is easily adaptable to pre-trained LDMs
and exhibits substantial potential for broader applications across diverse
medical image translation tasks.

*Mahdi Abavisani,Hamid Reza Vaezi Joze,Vishal M. Patel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种通过多模态知识训练单模态3D-CNN的方法，用于动态手势识别。使用时空语义对齐损失(SSA)和焦点正则化参数，使单模态网络能够学习多模态知识，提高性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常显式组合多模态信息，但本文希望通过嵌入多模态知识到单模态网络中，使每个单模态网络都能获得性能提升，避免显式多模态融合的复杂性。

Method: 为每个模态分配单独网络，通过时空语义对齐损失(SSA)强制不同网络的特征内容对齐，并使用焦点正则化参数防止负知识迁移。

Result: 实验结果表明，该框架提高了单模态网络的测试时识别准确率，并在多个动态手势识别数据集上达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 提出的方法成功地将多模态知识嵌入到单模态网络中，实现了更好的特征表示，为动态手势识别提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: We present an efficient approach for leveraging the knowledge from multiple
modalities in training unimodal 3D convolutional neural networks (3D-CNNs) for
the task of dynamic hand gesture recognition. Instead of explicitly combining
multimodal information, which is commonplace in many state-of-the-art methods,
we propose a different framework in which we embed the knowledge of multiple
modalities in individual networks so that each unimodal network can achieve an
improved performance. In particular, we dedicate separate networks per
available modality and enforce them to collaborate and learn to develop
networks with common semantics and better representations. We introduce a
"spatiotemporal semantic alignment" loss (SSA) to align the content of the
features from different networks. In addition, we regularize this loss with our
proposed "focal regularization parameter" to avoid negative knowledge transfer.
Experimental results show that our framework improves the test time recognition
accuracy of unimodal networks, and provides the state-of-the-art performance on
various dynamic hand gesture recognition datasets.

Motivation: 柔性微电极植入脑皮层具有挑战性，因为FME探针的可变形纤维状结构与关键生物组织相互作用。为确保可靠性和安全性，需要仔细监控植入过程。

Method: 利用机器人FME植入系统的显微摄像头，在四个检查点分别检查微针、FME探针、钩挂结果和植入点。采用预训练的视觉Transformer，提出渐进粒度补丁特征采样方法解决不同位置的敏感度-容忍度权衡问题，并选择信噪比更高的特征通道。

Conclusion: 提出的图像异常检测框架能够有效监控柔性微电极植入过程，确保植入的可靠性和安全性。

Abstract: Flexible microelectrode (FME) implantation into brain cortex is challenging
due to the deformable fiber-like structure of FME probe and the interaction
with critical bio-tissue. To ensure reliability and safety, the implantation
process should be monitored carefully. This paper develops an image-based
anomaly detection framework based on the microscopic cameras of the robotic FME
implantation system. The unified framework is utilized at four checkpoints to
check the micro-needle, FME probe, hooking result, and implantation point,
respectively. Exploiting the existing object localization results, the aligned
regions of interest (ROIs) are extracted from raw image and input to a
pretrained vision transformer (ViT). Considering the task specifications, we
propose a progressive granularity patch feature sampling method to address the
sensitivity-tolerance trade-off issue at different locations. Moreover, we
select a part of feature channels with higher signal-to-noise ratios from the
raw general ViT features, to provide better descriptors for each specific
scene. The effectiveness of the proposed methods is validated with the image
datasets collected from our implantation system.

Abstract: We present a transductive deep learning-based formulation for the sparse
representation-based classification (SRC) method. The proposed network consists
of a convolutional autoencoder along with a fully-connected layer. The role of
the autoencoder network is to learn robust deep features for classification. On
the other hand, the fully-connected layer, which is placed in between the
encoder and the decoder networks, is responsible for finding the sparse
representation. The estimated sparse codes are then used for classification.
Various experiments on three different datasets show that the proposed network
leads to sparse representations that give better classification results than
state-of-the-art SRC methods. The source code is available at:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MambaH-Fit是一个基于状态空间建模的点云法向量估计框架，通过注意力驱动的层次特征融合和补丁级状态空间模型，有效捕捉细粒度几何结构，在精度、鲁棒性和灵活性方面优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有法向量估计方法在建模细粒度几何结构方面存在不足，限制了预测精度。虽然Mamba等状态空间模型在点云处理中展现了强大建模能力，但现有方法主要关注全局形状结构，对局部细粒度几何细节的建模研究不足。

Method: 1. 注意力驱动的层次特征融合(AHFF)：自适应融合多尺度点云补丁特征，增强局部邻域的几何上下文学习；2. 补丁级状态空间模型(PSSM)：将点云补丁建模为通过状态动态的隐式超曲面，实现有效的细粒度几何理解。

Result: 在基准数据集上的大量实验表明，该方法在精度、鲁棒性和灵活性方面优于现有方法。消融研究进一步验证了所提出组件的贡献。

Conclusion: MambaH-Fit通过结合注意力驱动的层次特征融合和补丁级状态空间模型，成功解决了点云法向量估计中细粒度几何结构建模的挑战，为点云处理提供了更精确和鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: We present MambaH-Fit, a state space modelling framework tailored for
hyper-surface fitting-based point cloud normal estimation. Existing normal
estimation methods often fall short in modelling fine-grained geometric
structures, thereby limiting the accuracy of the predicted normals. Recently,
state space models (SSMs), particularly Mamba, have demonstrated strong
modelling capability by capturing long-range dependencies with linear
complexity and inspired adaptations to point cloud processing. However,
existing Mamba-based approaches primarily focus on understanding global shape
structures, leaving the modelling of local, fine-grained geometric details
largely under-explored. To address the issues above, we first introduce an
Attention-driven Hierarchical Feature Fusion (AHFF) scheme to adaptively fuse
multi-scale point cloud patch features, significantly enhancing geometric
context learning in local point cloud neighbourhoods. Building upon this, we
further propose Patch-wise State Space Model (PSSM) that models point cloud
patches as implicit hyper-surfaces via state dynamics, enabling effective
fine-grained geometric understanding for normal prediction. Extensive
experiments on benchmark datasets show that our method outperforms existing
ones in terms of accuracy, robustness, and flexibility. Ablation studies
further validate the contribution of the proposed components.

Motivation: 无人机在军事侦察、环境监测等领域的广泛应用对准确高效的多目标跟踪技术提出了迫切需求，但复杂背景、小尺度目标、频繁遮挡和交互等问题持续挑战现有方法的检测精度和轨迹连续性。

Method: 提出GL-DT框架，采用STFF模块联合建模运动和外观特征，结合全局-局部协同检测策略增强小目标检测，并引入JPTrack跟踪算法解决ID切换和轨迹碎片化问题。

Result: 实验结果表明，所提方法在保持实时性能的同时，显著提高了多目标跟踪的连续性和稳定性。

Conclusion: 该研究为无人机检测和跟踪技术的发展提供了有力支持，有效解决了复杂场景下多目标跟踪的关键挑战。

Abstract: The extensive application of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in military
reconnaissance, environmental monitoring, and related domains has created an
urgent need for accurate and efficient multi-object tracking (MOT)
technologies, which are also essential for UAV situational awareness. However,
complex backgrounds, small-scale targets, and frequent occlusions and
interactions continue to challenge existing methods in terms of detection
accuracy and trajectory continuity. To address these issues, this paper
proposes the Global-Local Detection and Tracking (GL-DT) framework. It employs
a Spatio-Temporal Feature Fusion (STFF) module to jointly model motion and
appearance features, combined with a global-local collaborative detection
strategy, effectively enhancing small-target detection. Building upon this, the
JPTrack tracking algorithm is introduced to mitigate common issues such as ID
switches and trajectory fragmentation. Experimental results demonstrate that
the proposed approach significantly improves the continuity and stability of
MOT while maintaining real-time performance, providing strong support for the
advancement of UAV detection and tracking technologies.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 将密集的Diffusion Transformer转换为混合专家结构，通过MoE层和混合块选择性地激活参数，在保持性能的同时减少60%的激活参数，超越了传统的剪枝方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DiT模型参数量大导致推理开销高，现有剪枝方法在激进剪枝时会导致严重的性能下降，需要一种既能减少激活参数又能保持模型能力的方法。

Method: 将DiT块中的前馈网络替换为MoE层，引入混合块选择性激活机制，并设计了多步蒸馏流程，包括基于泰勒度量的专家初始化、负载均衡的知识蒸馏和组特征损失优化。

Result: 将FLUX.1等大型扩散Transformer转换为MoE结构，FFN中的激活参数减少62.5%，整体激活参数减少60%，同时保持原始性能，在广泛实验中超越了基于剪枝的方法。

Conclusion: Dense2MoE为高效文本到图像生成建立了新范式，通过结构化稀疏化在减少计算开销的同时保持了模型能力。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformer (DiT) has demonstrated remarkable performance in
text-to-image generation; however, its large parameter size results in
substantial inference overhead. Existing parameter compression methods
primarily focus on pruning, but aggressive pruning often leads to severe
performance degradation due to reduced model capacity. To address this
limitation, we pioneer the transformation of a dense DiT into a Mixture of
Experts (MoE) for structured sparsification, reducing the number of activated
parameters while preserving model capacity. Specifically, we replace the
Feed-Forward Networks (FFNs) in DiT Blocks with MoE layers, reducing the number
of activated parameters in the FFNs by 62.5\%. Furthermore, we propose the
Mixture of Blocks (MoB) to selectively activate DiT blocks, thereby further
enhancing sparsity. To ensure an effective dense-to-MoE conversion, we design a
multi-step distillation pipeline, incorporating Taylor metric-based expert
initialization, knowledge distillation with load balancing, and group feature
loss for MoB optimization. We transform large diffusion transformers (e.g.,
FLUX.1 [dev]) into an MoE structure, reducing activated parameters by 60\%
while maintaining original performance and surpassing pruning-based approaches
in extensive experiments. Overall, Dense2MoE establishes a new paradigm for
efficient text-to-image generation.

Abstract: Intelligent analysis of medical imaging plays a crucial role in assisting
clinical diagnosis, especially for identifying subtle pathological features.
This paper introduces a novel multi-branch ConvNeXt architecture designed
specifically for the nuanced challenges of medical image analysis. While
applied here to the specific problem of COVID-19 diagnosis, the methodology
offers a generalizable framework for classifying a wide range of pathologies
from CT scans. The proposed model incorporates a rigorous end-to-end pipeline,
from meticulous data preprocessing and augmentation to a disciplined two-phase
training strategy that leverages transfer learning effectively. The
architecture uniquely integrates features extracted from three parallel
branches: Global Average Pooling, Global Max Pooling, and a new
Attention-weighted Pooling mechanism. The model was trained and validated on a
combined dataset of 2,609 CT slices derived from two distinct datasets.
Experimental results demonstrate a superior performance on the validation set,
achieving a final ROC-AUC of 0.9937, a validation accuracy of 0.9757, and an
F1-score of 0.9825 for COVID-19 cases, outperforming all previously reported
models on this dataset. These findings indicate that a modern, multi-branch
architecture, coupled with careful data handling, can achieve performance
comparable to or exceeding contemporary state-of-the-art models, thereby
proving the efficacy of advanced deep learning techniques for robust medical
diagnostics.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SOS是一个简单可扩展的数据合成流水线，通过对象中心合成策略生成高质量合成数据，在检测和视觉定位任务上超越大型真实数据集的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉分组任务需要大量标注数据，但真实数据标注成本高、覆盖偏差大且难以扩展。合成数据有潜力但缺乏灵活性、准确性和组合多样性。

Method: 基于对象中心组合策略，使用结构化布局先验和生成式重光照，将高质量合成对象片段粘贴到新图像中，生成准确的掩码、边界框和指代表达式。

Result: 在10万张合成图像上训练的模型在检测和定位任务上优于在更大真实数据集（GRIT 20M、V3Det 200K）上训练的模型：LVIS检测+10.9 AP，gRefCOCO定位+8.4 N_Acc。在有限真实数据场景下表现更佳。

Conclusion: SOS支持可控数据集构建，提升泛化能力，在低数据和封闭词汇设置中表现优异，能够针对性地生成具有挑战性的类内指代数据。

Abstract: Visual grouping -- operationalized via instance segmentation, visual
grounding, and object detection -- underpins applications from robotic
perception to photo editing. Large annotated datasets are costly, biased in
coverage, and hard to scale. Synthetic data are promising but often lack
flexibility, accuracy, and compositional diversity.
  We present SOS, a simple and scalable data synthesis pipeline based on an
object-centric composition strategy. It pastes high-quality synthetic object
segments into new images using structured layout priors and generative
relighting, producing accurate and diverse masks, boxes, and referring
expressions. Models trained on 100000 synthetic images from SOS outperform
those trained on larger real-image datasets such as GRIT (20M) and V3Det (200K)
on detection and grounding tasks, achieving +10.9 AP on LVIS detection and +8.4
$N_{\text{Acc}}$ on gRefCOCO grounding. SOS enables controllable dataset
construction and improves generalization in both low-data and closed-vocabulary
settings. Augmenting LVIS and COCO with synthetic object segments yields strong
performance across real-data scales and even larger gains under extremely
limited real data (for example, +3.83 $AP_{\text{rare}}$ on LVIS instance
segmentation and +6.59 AP with a 1 percent COCO setup). This controllability
also supports targeted data generation for challenging intra-class referring in
visual grounding.

TL;DR: 提出多模态语义扩散模型(MSDM)，通过整合细胞核形态、颜色特征和元数据来生成逼真的图像-掩码对，用于解决计算病理学中细胞和细胞核分割的标注数据稀缺问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 计算病理学中细胞和细胞核分割面临标注数据稀缺的挑战，特别是对于罕见或非典型形态。手动标注成本高昂，而合成数据提供了一种经济有效的替代方案。

Method: 使用多模态语义扩散模型(MSDM)，通过细胞/细胞核形态图、RGB颜色特征和BERT编码的元数据来条件化生成过程，通过多头交叉注意力机制整合这些异质模态，实现对生成图像的细粒度控制。

Result: 合成图像与真实数据高度匹配，在匹配生物条件下生成图像与真实图像的嵌入之间具有低Wasserstein距离。加入合成样本（如柱状细胞）显著提高了分割模型在柱状细胞上的准确性。

Conclusion: 多模态扩散增强策略有效提升了细胞和细胞核分割模型的鲁棒性和泛化能力，为生成模型在计算病理学中的更广泛应用铺平了道路。

Abstract: Scarcity of annotated data, particularly for rare or atypical morphologies,
present significant challenges for cell and nuclei segmentation in
computational pathology. While manual annotation is labor-intensive and costly,
synthetic data offers a cost-effective alternative. We introduce a Multimodal
Semantic Diffusion Model (MSDM) for generating realistic pixel-precise
image-mask pairs for cell and nuclei segmentation. By conditioning the
generative process with cellular/nuclear morphologies (using horizontal and
vertical maps), RGB color characteristics, and BERT-encoded assay/indication
metadata, MSDM generates datasests with desired morphological properties. These
heterogeneous modalities are integrated via multi-head cross-attention,
enabling fine-grained control over the generated images. Quantitative analysis
demonstrates that synthetic images closely match real data, with low
Wasserstein distances between embeddings of generated and real images under
matching biological conditions. The incorporation of these synthetic samples,
exemplified by columnar cells, significantly improves segmentation model
accuracy on columnar cells. This strategy systematically enriches data sets,
directly targeting model deficiencies. We highlight the effectiveness of
multimodal diffusion-based augmentation for advancing the robustness and
generalizability of cell and nuclei segmentation models. Thereby, we pave the
way for broader application of generative models in computational pathology.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了PSepT（极坐标可分离变换），一种可分离的正交变换，解决了极坐标中不可分离性的问题，显著降低了计算复杂度和内存需求，同时保持了良好的数值稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的正交矩图像表示方法（如Zernike和伪Zernike矩）存在高计算复杂度和数值不稳定性的问题，特别是在大阶数时，这限制了它们在实际应用中的使用。

Method: 通过张量积构造离散余弦变换（DCT）径向基和傅里叶谐波角向基，实现了核函数的完全分解，使得径向和角向处理可以独立进行。

Result: PSepT将计算复杂度从O(n^3N^2)到O(n^6N^2)降低到O(N^2 log N)，内存需求从O(N^4)降低到O(N^2)，条件数缩放从O(N^4)降低到O(√N)。实验结果显示更好的数值稳定性、计算效率和在有结构数据集上的竞争性分类性能。

Conclusion: PSepT的可分离框架使得以前用经典方法无法实现的高阶矩分析成为可能，为稳健的图像分析应用开辟了新的可能性。

Abstract: Orthogonal moment-based image representations are fundamental in computer
vision, but classical methods suffer from high computational complexity and
numerical instability at large orders. Zernike and pseudo-Zernike moments, for
instance, require coupled radial-angular processing that precludes efficient
factorization, resulting in $\mathcal{O}(n^3N^2)$ to $\mathcal{O}(n^6N^2)$
complexity and $\mathcal{O}(N^4)$ condition number scaling for the $n$th-order
moments on an $N\times N$ image. We introduce \textbf{PSepT} (Polar Separable
Transform), a separable orthogonal transform that overcomes the
non-separability barrier in polar coordinates. PSepT achieves complete kernel
factorization via tensor-product construction of Discrete Cosine Transform
(DCT) radial bases and Fourier harmonic angular bases, enabling independent
radial and angular processing. This separable design reduces computational
complexity to $\mathcal{O}(N^2 \log N)$, memory requirements to
$\mathcal{O}(N^2)$, and condition number scaling to $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{N})$,
representing exponential improvements over polynomial approaches. PSepT
exhibits orthogonality, completeness, energy conservation, and
rotation-covariance properties. Experimental results demonstrate better
numerical stability, computational efficiency, and competitive classification
performance on structured datasets, while preserving exact reconstruction. The
separable framework enables high-order moment analysis previously infeasible
with classical methods, opening new possibilities for robust image analysis
applications.

Motivation: 深度神经网络通常被视为不透明系统，需要可解释性方法来提高信任度和问责制。现有方法通常将测试时预测归因于输入特征或影响训练样本，作者认为应该同时研究这两种视角。

Method: 探索训练特征归因方法，将测试预测与特定训练图像的特定区域联系起来。

Result: 在视觉数据集上的实验表明，训练特征归因提供了细粒度的、测试特定的解释：识别导致错误分类的有害示例，并揭示传统归因方法未能暴露的虚假相关性（如基于补丁的捷径）。

Conclusion: 训练特征归因方法能够提供新的视角来理解深度模型的内部工作原理，识别传统方法无法发现的模式和问题。

Abstract: Deep neural networks are often considered opaque systems, prompting the need
for explainability methods to improve trust and accountability. Existing
approaches typically attribute test-time predictions either to input features
(e.g., pixels in an image) or to influential training examples. We argue that
both perspectives should be studied jointly. This work explores *training
feature attribution*, which links test predictions to specific regions of
specific training images and thereby provides new insights into the inner
workings of deep models. Our experiments on vision datasets show that training
feature attribution yields fine-grained, test-specific explanations: it
identifies harmful examples that drive misclassifications and reveals spurious
correlations, such as patch-based shortcuts, that conventional attribution
methods fail to expose.

Motivation: 支气管镜检查中，医生需要确定镜体位置，但由于复杂的支气管树结构和医生经验差异，这项任务具有挑战性。现有导航方法依赖CT扫描和额外传感器，需要额外设置和训练。拓扑定位通常足以提供导航辅助。

Method: 开发基于图像的支气管镜拓扑定位管道，仅在幻影数据上训练，无需真实患者CT扫描或数据标注。

Result: 该方法超越了现有方法，特别是在真实数据测试序列上表现优异。

Conclusion: 提出的图像基支气管镜拓扑定位管道能够有效提供导航辅助，无需患者CT扫描，训练成本低且具有良好的泛化性能。

Abstract: Video bronchoscopy is a fundamental procedure in respiratory medicine, where
medical experts navigate through the bronchial tree of a patient to diagnose or
operate the patient. Surgeons need to determine the position of the scope as
they go through the airway until they reach the area of interest. This task is
very challenging for practitioners due to the complex bronchial tree structure
and varying doctor experience and training. Navigation assistance to locate the
bronchoscope during the procedure can improve its outcome. Currently used
techniques for navigational guidance commonly rely on previous CT scans of the
patient to obtain a 3D model of the airway, followed by tracking of the scope
with additional sensors or image registration. These methods obtain accurate
locations but imply additional setup, scans and training. Accurate metric
localization is not always required, and a topological localization with regard
to a generic airway model can often suffice to assist the surgeon with
navigation. We present an image-based bronchoscopy topological localization
pipeline to provide navigation assistance during the procedure, with no need of
patient CT scan. Our approach is trained only on phantom data, eliminating the
high cost of real data labeling, and presents good generalization capabilities.
The results obtained surpass existing methods, particularly on real data test
sequences.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实例级识别需要识别单个对象而非宽泛类别，但细粒度特性使得大规模标注数据集创建困难，限制了其在实际应用中的广泛使用。

Method: 通过合成方法从多个领域生成多样化对象实例，形成大规模训练集，无需依赖任何真实图像，然后对基础视觉模型进行微调。

Result: 在七个跨多个领域的ILR基准测试中，检索性能显著提升，为数据收集和整理提供了高效有效的替代方案。

Conclusion: 该方法引入了一种新的ILR范式，只需输入目标领域名称即可解锁广泛的现实应用，为实例级识别提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Instance-level recognition (ILR) focuses on identifying individual objects
rather than broad categories, offering the highest granularity in image
classification. However, this fine-grained nature makes creating large-scale
annotated datasets challenging, limiting ILR's real-world applicability across
domains. To overcome this, we introduce a novel approach that synthetically
generates diverse object instances from multiple domains under varied
conditions and backgrounds, forming a large-scale training set. Unlike prior
work on automatic data synthesis, our method is the first to address
ILR-specific challenges without relying on any real images. Fine-tuning
foundation vision models on the generated data significantly improves retrieval
performance across seven ILR benchmarks spanning multiple domains. Our approach
offers a new, efficient, and effective alternative to extensive data collection
and curation, introducing a new ILR paradigm where the only input is the names
of the target domains, unlocking a wide range of real-world applications.

Abstract: Modern object detectors are largely confined to a "closed-world" assumption,
limiting them to a predefined set of classes and posing risks when encountering
novel objects in real-world scenarios. While open-set detection methods aim to
address this by identifying such instances as 'Unknown', this is often
insufficient. Rather than treating all unknowns as a single class, assigning
them more descriptive subcategories can enhance decision-making in
safety-critical contexts. For example, identifying an object as an 'Unknown
Animal' (requiring an urgent stop) versus 'Unknown Debris' (requiring a safe
lane change) is far more useful than just 'Unknown' in autonomous driving. To
bridge this gap, we introduce TARO, a novel detection framework that not only
identifies unknown objects but also classifies them into coarse parent
categories within a semantic hierarchy. TARO employs a unique architecture with
a sparsemax-based head for modeling objectness, a hierarchy-guided relabeling
component that provides auxiliary supervision, and a classification module that
learns hierarchical relationships. Experiments show TARO can categorize up to
29.9% of unknowns into meaningful coarse classes, significantly reduce
confusion between unknown and known classes, and achieve competitive
performance in both unknown recall and known mAP. Code will be made available.

TL;DR: 提出了在线视频深度估计方法oVDA，通过借鉴LLM的缓存和掩码技术，在保持精度的同时显著降低VRAM使用，实现在边缘设备上的高效部署。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的Video Depth Anything方法依赖批处理，无法用于在线场景，限制了其在实时系统中的应用。

Method: 借鉴大语言模型技术，在推理时缓存潜在特征，在训练时使用帧掩码，实现高效的在线深度估计。

Result: oVDA在精度和VRAM使用上均优于所有竞争方法，在NVIDIA A100上达到42 FPS，在Jetson边缘设备上达到20 FPS。

Conclusion: oVDA成功解决了在线视频深度估计问题，为边缘设备部署提供了高效解决方案，代码将开源以便部署。

Abstract: Depth estimation from monocular video has become a key component of many
real-world computer vision systems. Recently, Video Depth Anything (VDA) has
demonstrated strong performance on long video sequences. However, it relies on
batch-processing which prohibits its use in an online setting. In this work, we
overcome this limitation and introduce online VDA (oVDA). The key innovation is
to employ techniques from Large Language Models (LLMs), namely, caching latent
features during inference and masking frames at training. Our oVDA method
outperforms all competing online video depth estimation methods in both
accuracy and VRAM usage. Low VRAM usage is particularly important for
deployment on edge devices. We demonstrate that oVDA runs at 42 FPS on an
NVIDIA A100 and at 20 FPS on an NVIDIA Jetson edge device. We will release
both, code and compilation scripts, making oVDA easy to deploy on low-power
hardware.

Abstract: Cricket shot classification from video sequences remains a challenging
problem in sports video analysis, requiring effective modeling of both spatial
and temporal features. This paper presents the first comprehensive baseline
study comparing seven different deep learning approaches across four distinct
research paradigms for cricket shot classification. We implement and
systematically evaluate traditional CNN-LSTM architectures, attention-based
models, vision transformers, transfer learning approaches, and modern
EfficientNet-GRU combinations on a unified benchmark. A critical finding of our
study is the significant performance gap between claims in academic literature
and practical implementation results. While previous papers reported accuracies
of 96\% (Balaji LRCN), 99.2\% (IJERCSE), and 93\% (Sensors), our standardized
re-implementations achieve 46.0\%, 55.6\%, and 57.7\% respectively. Our modern
SOTA approach, combining EfficientNet-B0 with a GRU-based temporal model,
achieves 92.25\% accuracy, demonstrating that substantial improvements are
possible with modern architectures and systematic optimization. All
implementations follow modern MLOps practices with PyTorch Lightning, providing
a reproducible research platform that exposes the critical importance of
standardized evaluation protocols in sports video analysis research.

Abstract: Autonomous driving (AD) systems are becoming increasingly capable of handling
complex tasks, mainly due to recent advances in deep learning and AI. As
interactions between autonomous systems and humans increase, the
interpretability of decision-making processes in driving systems becomes
increasingly crucial for ensuring safe driving operations. Successful
human-machine interaction requires understanding the underlying representations
of the environment and the driving task, which remains a significant challenge
in deep learning-based systems. To address this, we introduce the task of
interpretability in maneuver prediction before they occur for driver safety,
i.e., driver intent prediction (DIP), which plays a critical role in AD
systems. To foster research in interpretable DIP, we curate the eXplainable
Driving Action Anticipation Dataset (DAAD-X), a new multimodal, ego-centric
video dataset to provide hierarchical, high-level textual explanations as
causal reasoning for the driver's decisions. These explanations are derived
from both the driver's eye-gaze and the ego-vehicle's perspective. Next, we
propose Video Concept Bottleneck Model (VCBM), a framework that generates
spatio-temporally coherent explanations inherently, without relying on post-hoc
techniques. Finally, through extensive evaluations of the proposed VCBM on the
DAAD-X dataset, we demonstrate that transformer-based models exhibit greater
interpretability than conventional CNN-based models. Additionally, we introduce
a multilabel t-SNE visualization technique to illustrate the disentanglement
and causal correlation among multiple explanations. Our data, code and models
are available at: https://mukil07.github.io/VCBM.github.io/

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Cattle-CLIP是一个基于CLIP的多模态深度学习框架，通过添加时间整合模块和专门的数据增强策略，在牛只行为识别任务中取得了96.1%的整体准确率，在少样本学习场景下也表现出良好的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 牛只行为是动物健康、生产力和整体福祉的重要指标。视频监控结合深度学习已成为动物生物识别的主流方法，但现有方法在数据稀缺的行为识别任务上表现不佳，这是一个重要但研究不足的领域。

Method: 基于大规模图像-语言模型CLIP进行适配，添加时间整合模块来处理视频序列。针对预训练模型使用的网络数据与真实牛只监控视频之间的领域差异，引入了定制化的数据增强策略和专门设计的文本提示。

Result: 在完全监督设置下，Cattle-CLIP在六种行为上达到96.1%的整体准确率，其中进食、饮水和站立反刍行为的召回率接近100%。在少样本学习场景下也展现出稳健的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 多模态学习在农业和动物行为分析中具有巨大潜力，Cattle-CLIP框架为数据稀缺的牲畜监测任务提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Cattle behaviour is a crucial indicator of an individual animal health,
productivity and overall well-being. Video-based monitoring, combined with deep
learning techniques, has become a mainstream approach in animal biometrics, and
it can offer high accuracy in some behaviour recognition tasks. We present
Cattle-CLIP, a multimodal deep learning framework for cattle behaviour
recognition, using semantic cues to improve the performance of video-based
visual feature recognition. It is adapted from the large-scale image-language
model CLIP by adding a temporal integration module. To address the domain gap
between web data used for the pre-trained model and real-world cattle
surveillance footage, we introduce tailored data augmentation strategies and
specialised text prompts. Cattle-CLIP is evaluated under both fully-supervised
and few-shot learning scenarios, with a particular focus on data-scarce
behaviour recognition - an important yet under-explored goal in livestock
monitoring. To evaluate the proposed method, we release the CattleBehaviours6
dataset, which comprises six types of indoor behaviours: feeding, drinking,
standing-self-grooming, standing-ruminating, lying-self-grooming and
lying-ruminating. The dataset consists of 1905 clips collected from our John
Oldacre Centre dairy farm research platform housing 200 Holstein-Friesian cows.
Experiments show that Cattle-CLIP achieves 96.1% overall accuracy across six
behaviours in a supervised setting, with nearly 100% recall for feeding,
drinking and standing-ruminating behaviours, and demonstrates robust
generalisation with limited data in few-shot scenarios, highlighting the
potential of multimodal learning in agricultural and animal behaviour analysis.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种通用的时间分辨Transformer（TRT）架构，用于提升光子效率成像中的3D重建性能，包括LOS和NLOS成像任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于传感器量子效率低和高噪声水平，特别是在长距离或复杂场景中，时间分辨测量的3D重建面临挑战。

Method: 设计了专门针对时空瞬态测量的注意力机制：时空自注意力编码器通过分割或下采样输入特征来探索局部和全局相关性；时空交叉注意力解码器在标记空间中整合局部和全局特征。

Result: 在合成数据和真实世界数据上的广泛实验表明，TRT-LOS和TRT-NLOS都显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: TRT架构有效提升了光子效率成像的3D重建性能，并为该领域贡献了大规模合成数据集和真实世界测量数据。

Abstract: Transient measurements, captured by the timeresolved systems, are widely
employed in photon-efficient reconstruction tasks, including line-of-sight
(LOS) and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) imaging. However, challenges persist in
their 3D reconstruction due to the low quantum efficiency of sensors and the
high noise levels, particularly for long-range or complex scenes. To boost the
3D reconstruction performance in photon-efficient imaging, we propose a generic
Time-Resolved Transformer (TRT) architecture. Different from existing
transformers designed for high-dimensional data, TRT has two elaborate
attention designs tailored for the spatio-temporal transient measurements.
Specifically, the spatio-temporal self-attention encoders explore both local
and global correlations within transient data by splitting or downsampling
input features into different scales. Then, the spatio-temporal cross attention
decoders integrate the local and global features in the token space, resulting
in deep features with high representation capabilities. Building on TRT, we
develop two task-specific embodiments: TRT-LOS for LOS imaging and TRT-NLOS for
NLOS imaging. Extensive experiments demonstrate that both embodiments
significantly outperform existing methods on synthetic data and real-world data
captured by different imaging systems. In addition, we contribute a
large-scale, high-resolution synthetic LOS dataset with various noise levels
and capture a set of real-world NLOS measurements using a custom-built imaging
system, enhancing the data diversity in this field. Code and datasets are

*Wuyang Li,Wentao Pan,Po-Chien Luan,Yang Gao,Alexandre Alahi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Stable Video Infinity (SVI)方法，能够生成无限长度视频，具有高时间一致性、合理的场景转换和可控的流式故事情节。通过错误回收微调技术，让模型学习识别和纠正自身错误。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有长视频生成方法局限于单提示外推，产生同质化场景和重复动作。根本挑战在于训练假设（看到干净数据）与测试时自回归现实（基于自生成的错误输出）之间的关键差异。

Method: 采用错误回收微调技术：注入历史错误干预干净输入；通过一步双向积分高效近似预测；动态将错误存入重放内存并在不同时间步重新采样。

Result: SVI能够将视频从秒级扩展到无限时长，无需额外推理成本，同时兼容多种条件（音频、骨架、文本流）。在三个基准测试中验证了其多功能性和最先进性能。

Conclusion: SVI通过错误回收微调成功解决了长视频生成中的假设差距问题，实现了无限时长视频生成，在一致性和创造性设置中都表现出色。

Abstract: We propose Stable Video Infinity (SVI) that is able to generate
infinite-length videos with high temporal consistency, plausible scene
transitions, and controllable streaming storylines. While existing long-video
methods attempt to mitigate accumulated errors via handcrafted anti-drifting
(e.g., modified noise scheduler, frame anchoring), they remain limited to
single-prompt extrapolation, producing homogeneous scenes with repetitive
motions. We identify that the fundamental challenge extends beyond error
accumulation to a critical discrepancy between the training assumption (seeing
clean data) and the test-time autoregressive reality (conditioning on
self-generated, error-prone outputs). To bridge this hypothesis gap, SVI
incorporates Error-Recycling Fine-Tuning, a new type of efficient training that
recycles the Diffusion Transformer (DiT)'s self-generated errors into
supervisory prompts, thereby encouraging DiT to actively identify and correct
its own errors. This is achieved by injecting, collecting, and banking errors
through closed-loop recycling, autoregressively learning from error-injected
feedback. Specifically, we (i) inject historical errors made by DiT to
intervene on clean inputs, simulating error-accumulated trajectories in flow
matching; (ii) efficiently approximate predictions with one-step bidirectional
integration and calculate errors with residuals; (iii) dynamically bank errors
into replay memory across discretized timesteps, which are resampled for new
input. SVI is able to scale videos from seconds to infinite durations with no
additional inference cost, while remaining compatible with diverse conditions
(e.g., audio, skeleton, and text streams). We evaluate SVI on three benchmarks,
including consistent, creative, and conditional settings, thoroughly verifying
its versatility and state-of-the-art role.

Motivation: 跨域序列推荐系统需要准确捕捉域内和跨域行为模式，为用户提供个性化体验。现有方法在语义理解和跨域建模方面存在不足。

Method: 使用LLM生成领域感知的语义标签，将标签嵌入与项目标识符、文本和视觉特征融合，构建增强的项目表示，并引入标签增强的多注意力机制联合建模域内和跨域用户偏好。

Conclusion: 该方法展示了LLM在推进智能、以用户为中心的服务方面的潜力，特别是在消费电子领域的推荐系统中。

Abstract: Cross-Domain Sequential Recommendation (CDSR) plays a crucial role in modern
consumer electronics and e-commerce platforms, where users interact with
diverse services such as books, movies, and online retail products. These
systems must accurately capture both domain-specific and cross-domain
behavioral patterns to provide personalized and seamless consumer experiences.
To address this challenge, we propose \textbf{TEMA-LLM} (\textit{Tag-Enriched
Multi-Attention with Large Language Models}), a practical and effective
framework that integrates \textit{Large Language Models (LLMs)} for semantic
tag generation and enrichment. Specifically, TEMA-LLM employs LLMs to assign
domain-aware prompts and generate descriptive tags from item titles and
descriptions. The resulting tag embeddings are fused with item identifiers as
well as textual and visual features to construct enhanced item representations.
A \textit{Tag-Enriched Multi-Attention} mechanism is then introduced to jointly
model user preferences within and across domains, enabling the system to
capture complex and evolving consumer interests. Extensive experiments on four
large-scale e-commerce datasets demonstrate that TEMA-LLM consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, underscoring the benefits of LLM-based
semantic tagging and multi-attention integration for consumer-facing
recommendation systems. The proposed approach highlights the potential of LLMs
to advance intelligent, user-centric services in the field of consumer
electronics.

Result: HMVDx在肩关节损伤诊断中的准确率比直接视频诊断提高了79.6%。

Conclusion: 该研究展示了低成本多模态大语言模型在医疗应用中的潜力，为未来医学视频理解研究做出了重要技术贡献。

Abstract: Shoulder disorders, such as frozen shoulder (a.k.a., adhesive capsulitis),
are common conditions affecting the health of people worldwide, and have a high
incidence rate among the elderly and workers engaged in repetitive shoulder
tasks. In regions with scarce medical resources, achieving early and accurate
diagnosis poses significant challenges, and there is an urgent need for
low-cost and easily scalable auxiliary diagnostic solutions. This research
introduces videos captured by consumer-grade devices as the basis for
diagnosis, reducing the cost for users. We focus on the innovative application
of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in the preliminary diagnosis of
shoulder disorders and propose a Hybrid Motion Video Diagnosis framework
(HMVDx). This framework divides the two tasks of action understanding and
disease diagnosis, which are respectively completed by two MLLMs. In addition
to traditional evaluation indicators, this work proposes a novel metric called
Usability Index by the logical process of medical decision-making (action
recognition, movement diagnosis, and final diagnosis). This index evaluates the
effectiveness of MLLMs in the medical field from the perspective of the entire
medical diagnostic pathway, revealing the potential value of low-cost MLLMs in
medical applications for medical practitioners. In experimental comparisons,
the accuracy of HMVDx in diagnosing shoulder joint injuries has increased by
79.6\% compared with direct video diagnosis, a significant technical
contribution to future research on the application of MLLMs for video
understanding in the medical field.

Motivation: 黑盒视觉语言模型在医学图像问答中容易产生幻觉，需要可靠的方法来检测和过滤这些问题以提高诊断准确性。

Method: 使用GPT-4o和GPT-4.1模型，通过温度1.0生成15次回答，计算离散语义熵来量化语义不一致性，过滤高熵问题(DSE > 0.3)。

Result: 过滤高熵问题后，GPT-4o准确率从51.7%提升至76.3%，GPT-4.1从54.8%提升至63.8%，效果具有统计学显著性。

Conclusion: 离散语义熵是检测黑盒视觉语言模型幻觉的有效方法，能显著提高临床应用的诊断准确性。

Abstract: To determine whether using discrete semantic entropy (DSE) to reject
questions likely to generate hallucinations can improve the accuracy of
black-box vision-language models (VLMs) in radiologic image based visual
question answering (VQA). This retrospective study evaluated DSE using two
publicly available, de-identified datasets: (i) the VQA-Med 2019 benchmark (500
images with clinical questions and short-text answers) and (ii) a diagnostic
radiology dataset (206 cases: 60 computed tomography scans, 60 magnetic
resonance images, 60 radiographs, 26 angiograms) with corresponding
ground-truth diagnoses. GPT-4o and GPT-4.1 answered each question 15 times
using a temperature of 1.0. Baseline accuracy was determined using
low-temperature answers (temperature 0.1). Meaning-equivalent responses were
grouped using bidirectional entailment checks, and DSE was computed from the
relative frequencies of the resulting semantic clusters. Accuracy was
recalculated after excluding questions with DSE > 0.6 or > 0.3. p-values and
95% confidence intervals were obtained using bootstrap resampling and a
Bonferroni-corrected threshold of p < .004 for statistical significance. Across
706 image-question pairs, baseline accuracy was 51.7% for GPT-4o and 54.8% for
GPT-4.1. After filtering out high-entropy questions (DSE > 0.3), accuracy on
the remaining questions was 76.3% (retained questions: 334/706) for GPT-4o and
63.8% (retained questions: 499/706) for GPT-4.1 (both p < .001). Accuracy gains
were observed across both datasets and largely remained statistically
significant after Bonferroni correction. DSE enables reliable hallucination
detection in black-box VLMs by quantifying semantic inconsistency. This method
significantly improves diagnostic answer accuracy and offers a filtering
strategy for clinical VLM applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的LLM方法采样策略要么依赖手工启发式规则而忽略时序线索，要么使用外部关键帧模型增加系统复杂度，需要更统一的解决方案。

Method: 提出统一框架联合优化TSG和RefVOS；训练时使用[FIND]令牌通过时序令牌相似性匹配识别关键时刻；推理时使用时刻中心采样策略密集采样重要时刻；开发双向锚点更新传播机制提升跟踪稳定性。

Result: 该方法自然融入了关键时刻定位能力，避免了外部时间戳编码需求，同时保持了运动细节和全局上下文。

Conclusion: 提出的统一框架有效解决了RefVOS中的时序推理和视觉理解问题，通过联合优化和创新的采样策略提升了分割性能。

Abstract: Referring Video Object Segmentation (RefVOS) seeks to segment target objects
in videos guided by natural language descriptions, demanding both temporal
reasoning and fine-grained visual comprehension. Existing sampling strategies
for LLM-based approaches typically rely on either handcrafted heuristics or
external keyframe models. The former often overlooks essential temporal cues,
while the latter increases system complexity. To address this, we propose a
unified framework that jointly optimizes Temporal Sentence Grounding (TSG) and
RefVOS, naturally incorporating key moment grounding capability. During
training, we introduce a novel TSG paradigm that employs a dedicated
\texttt{[FIND]} token for key moment identification through temporal token
similarity matching, thereby avoiding the need for external timestamp
encodings. For inference, we design a Moment-Centric Sampling (MCS) strategy
that densely samples informative moments while sparsely sampling non-essential
frames, preserving both motion details and global context. To further enhance
tracking stability, we develop Bidirectional Anchor-updated Propagation (BAP),
which leverages the most relevant moment as start point for high-quality mask
initialization and dynamically updates at sampled points to mitigate
accumulated errors. Code and model will be available at:

Abstract: While Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has advanced the

a granular analysis of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) processes, we uncover two key
insights: first, token perception in a rollout trajectory is sparsely
distributed, where only a small fraction of tokens have high visual dependency
for visually-grounded reasoning; second, different trajectories exhibit
significant divergence in their overall visual dependency. Based on these
observations, we propose Visually-Perceptive Policy Optimization (VPPO), a
novel policy gradient algorithm that explicitly leverages token perception to
refine the learning signal. Specifically, VPPO achieves this through a dual
mechanism: it reweights a trajectory's advantage by its overall visual
dependency, and focuses policy updates exclusively on perceptually pivotal
tokens. On a comprehensive suite of eight perception and reasoning benchmarks,
VPPO demonstrates substantial gains over leading open-source RL-tuned models,
with its effectiveness consistently validated across 7B and 32B model scales.
Our findings not only establish a new token-level perceptual perspective for
analyzing multimodal RLVR but also present a novel and effective optimization
strategy to significantly enhance the multimodal reasoning capabilities of
LVLMs.

Method: 进行大规模人类实验，40名参与者观看50张不同图像，使用高速眼动仪记录超过400万注视点。分析注视轨迹统计特性，并训练CNN从图像预测注视热点图。

Result: 人类视觉注视轨迹遵循Levy行走模式，类似于动物觅食。CNN模型能够准确预测新图像的显著注视区域，表明注视行为的关键成分可从视觉结构学习。

Conclusion: 人类视觉探索遵循与自然觅食类似的统计规律，为通过生成和预测框架建模注视行为开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Animals often forage via Levy walks stochastic trajectories with heavy tailed
step lengths optimized for sparse resource environments. We show that human
visual gaze follows similar dynamics when scanning images. While traditional
models emphasize image based saliency, the underlying spatiotemporal statistics
of eye movements remain underexplored. Understanding these dynamics has broad
applications in attention modeling and vision-based interfaces. In this study,
we conducted a large scale human subject experiment involving 40 participants
viewing 50 diverse images under unconstrained conditions, recording over 4
million gaze points using a high speed eye tracker. Analysis of these data
shows that the gaze trajectory of the human eye also follows a Levy walk akin
to animal foraging. This suggests that the human eye forages for visual
information in an optimally efficient manner. Further, we trained a
convolutional neural network (CNN) to predict fixation heatmaps from image
input alone. The model accurately reproduced salient fixation regions across
novel images, demonstrating that key components of gaze behavior are learnable
from visual structure alone. Our findings present new evidence that human
visual exploration obeys statistical laws analogous to natural foraging and
open avenues for modeling gaze through generative and predictive frameworks.

TL;DR: 提出了CapGeo框架，通过将几何图形转换为文本描述来提升多模态大语言模型的几何推理能力，并创建了CapGeo-Bench基准数据集进行评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前最先进的多模态大语言模型在几何推理方面仍然表现不佳，瓶颈在于理解几何图形而非推理能力本身。由于几何图形可以用简洁的文本描述，将视觉内容转换为文本描述是一个有前景的方向。

Method: 引入CapGeo框架，通过辅助描述将视觉和文本模态连接起来。同时创建了CapGeo-Bench数据集，包含4,641个精心筛选的图形-描述对，并提出了基于关键点的评估指标。

Result: 使用描述后模型性能显著提升：Qwen2.5-VL-72B从8.6%提升到59.0%，Claude-Opus-4从44.8%提升到73.0%。关键点评估指标与下游CapGeo性能强相关。

Conclusion: 该框架和基准为推进多模态大语言模型的几何推理能力开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Geometric reasoning remains a core challenge for Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs). Even the most advanced closed-source systems, such as GPT-O3
and Gemini-2.5-Pro, still struggle to solve geometry problems reliably, despite
exhibiting strong textual reasoning abilities on tasks like the International
Mathematical Olympiad (IMO). This gap suggests that the bottleneck lies in
understanding geometric diagrams rather than reasoning itself. Since geometric
figures can often be faithfully described in concise textual form, converting
visual content into captions offers a promising direction. Motivated by this
insight, we introduce CapGeo, a caption-assisted reasoning framework that
bridges visual and textual modalities. Experiments show substantial
improvements when models are equipped with captions: Qwen2.5-VL-72B improves
from 8.6% (vision-only) to 59.0%, while Claude-Opus-4 rises from 44.8% to
73.0%. To systematically evaluate and identify high-quality geometric
captioning models, we further propose CapGeo-Bench, a dataset of 4,641 curated
figure-caption pairs. Crucially, CapGeo-Bench incorporates a keypoint-based
evaluation metric that correlates strongly with downstream CapGeo performance,
enabling reliable assessment of geometric captioning ability. Together, our
framework and benchmark highlight a new pathway toward advancing geometric
reasoning in MLLMs.

Result: 实验表明RadioFlow在保持重建精度的同时，参数减少8倍，推理速度提升4倍以上，达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: 该研究为未来6G网络的可扩展、节能和实时电磁数字孪生提供了有前景的途径。

Abstract: Accurate and real-time radio map (RM) generation is crucial for
next-generation wireless systems, yet diffusion-based approaches often suffer
from large model sizes, slow iterative denoising, and high inference latency,
which hinder practical deployment. To overcome these limitations, we propose
\textbf{RadioFlow}, a novel flow-matching-based generative framework that
achieves high-fidelity RM generation through single-step efficient sampling.
Unlike conventional diffusion models, RadioFlow learns continuous transport
trajectories between noise and data, enabling both training and inference to be
significantly accelerated while preserving reconstruction accuracy.
Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that RadioFlow achieves state-of-the-art
performance with \textbf{up to 8$\times$ fewer parameters} and \textbf{over
4$\times$ faster inference} compared to the leading diffusion-based baseline
(RadioDiff). This advancement provides a promising pathway toward scalable,
energy-efficient, and real-time electromagnetic digital twins for future 6G
networks. We release the code at

TL;DR: Hybrid-depth是一个自监督单目深度估计框架，通过整合CLIP和DINO基础模型来提取视觉先验和上下文信息，采用从粗到细的渐进学习策略，显著提升了深度估计性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前自监督单目深度估计方法由于语义-空间知识提取不足而面临性能限制，需要更好的上下文信息提取方法。

Method: 1) 聚合CLIP的全局语义和DINO的局部空间细节特征，在对比语言指导下设计代理任务进行深度感知特征对齐；2) 在粗特征基础上整合相机姿态信息和像素级语言对齐来细化深度预测，可作为即插即用模块与现有MDE管道集成。

Result: 在KITTI基准测试中，该方法在所有指标上显著优于最先进方法，并有益于下游任务如BEV感知。

Conclusion: 通过语言指导聚合CLIP的语义上下文和DINO的空间细节，Hybrid-depth有效解决了特征粒度不匹配问题，提升了自监督单目深度估计性能。

Abstract: Current self-supervised monocular depth estimation (MDE) approaches encounter
performance limitations due to insufficient semantic-spatial knowledge
extraction. To address this challenge, we propose Hybrid-depth, a novel
framework that systematically integrates foundation models (e.g., CLIP and
DINO) to extract visual priors and acquire sufficient contextual information
for MDE. Our approach introduces a coarse-to-fine progressive learning
framework: 1) Firstly, we aggregate multi-grained features from CLIP (global
semantics) and DINO (local spatial details) under contrastive language
guidance. A proxy task comparing close-distant image patches is designed to
enforce depth-aware feature alignment using text prompts; 2) Next, building on
the coarse features, we integrate camera pose information and pixel-wise
language alignment to refine depth predictions. This module seamlessly
integrates with existing self-supervised MDE pipelines (e.g., Monodepth2,
ManyDepth) as a plug-and-play depth encoder, enhancing continuous depth
estimation. By aggregating CLIP's semantic context and DINO's spatial details
through language guidance, our method effectively addresses feature granularity
mismatches. Extensive experiments on the KITTI benchmark demonstrate that our
method significantly outperforms SOTA methods across all metrics, which also
indeed benefits downstream tasks like BEV perception. Code is available at

TL;DR: 提出IRCR-Net网络，通过实例感知一致性正则化机制改进半监督细胞核实例分割，解决了现有方法在实例级一致性、病理结构先验知识利用和伪标签噪声方面的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 病理图像中的细胞核实例分割对肿瘤微环境分析至关重要，但标注数据成本高且稀缺限制了全监督方法的适用性，而现有半监督方法在实例级一致性正则化、病理结构先验知识利用和伪标签噪声控制方面存在不足。

Method: 提出IRCR-Net网络，包含匹配驱动的实例感知一致性(MIAC)和先验驱动的实例感知一致性(PIAC)机制，利用病理图像中细胞核的形态先验知识评估伪标签质量，丢弃低质量伪标签并增强高质量预测。

Conclusion: IRCR-Net通过实例感知一致性正则化和先验知识利用，有效解决了半监督细胞核实例分割中的关键挑战，为病理图像分析提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Nuclei instance segmentation in pathological images is crucial for downstream
tasks such as tumor microenvironment analysis. However, the high cost and
scarcity of annotated data limit the applicability of fully supervised methods,
while existing semi-supervised methods fail to adequately regularize
consistency at the instance level, lack leverage of the inherent prior
knowledge of pathological structures, and are prone to introducing noisy
pseudo-labels during training. In this paper, we propose an Instance-Aware
Robust Consistency Regularization Network (IRCR-Net) for accurate
instance-level nuclei segmentation. Specifically, we introduce the
Matching-Driven Instance-Aware Consistency (MIAC) and Prior-Driven
Instance-Aware Consistency (PIAC) mechanisms to refine the nuclei instance
segmentation result of the teacher and student subnetwork, particularly for
densely distributed and overlapping nuclei. We incorporate morphological prior
knowledge of nuclei in pathological images and utilize these priors to assess
the quality of pseudo-labels generated from unlabeled data. Low-quality
pseudo-labels are discarded, while high-quality predictions are enhanced to
reduce pseudo-label noise and benefit the network's robust training.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly
enhances semi-supervised nuclei instance segmentation performance across
multiple public datasets compared to existing approaches, even surpassing fully
supervised methods in some scenarios.

Conclusion: 提出的PPFN方法在热红外图像增强任务中表现出色，特别是在处理耦合退化问题时具有显著优势，并建立了高质量的多场景红外基准数据集。

Abstract: We engage in the relatively underexplored task named thermal infrared image
enhancement. Existing infrared image enhancement methods primarily focus on
tackling individual degradations, such as noise, contrast, and blurring, making
it difficult to handle coupled degradations. Meanwhile, all-in-one enhancement
methods, commonly applied to RGB sensors, often demonstrate limited
effectiveness due to the significant differences in imaging models. In sight of
this, we first revisit the imaging mechanism and introduce a Progressive Prompt
Fusion Network (PPFN). Specifically, the PPFN initially establishes prompt
pairs based on the thermal imaging process. For each type of degradation, we
fuse the corresponding prompt pairs to modulate the model's features, providing
adaptive guidance that enables the model to better address specific
degradations under single or multiple conditions. In addition, a Selective
Progressive Training (SPT) mechanism is introduced to gradually refine the
model's handling of composite cases to align the enhancement process, which not
only allows the model to remove camera noise and retain key structural details,
but also enhancing the overall contrast of the thermal image. Furthermore, we
introduce the most high-quality, multi-scenarios infrared benchmark covering a
wide range of scenarios. Extensive experiments substantiate that our approach
not only delivers promising visual results under specific degradation but also
significantly improves performance on complex degradation scenes, achieving a
notable 8.76\% improvement. Code is available at

TL;DR: 该论文提出使用视觉语言模型进行多模态关键词预测，通过零样本、监督微调、Fine-tune-CoT和动态CoT策略来提升模型性能，解决了传统多模态方法在缺失和未见场景下的局限性。

Motivation: 传统多模态方法在处理缺失和未见场景时存在显著局限性，现有基准测试因训练测试重叠度高而高估模型能力。需要开发更有效的多模态关键词预测方法。

Method: 1. 使用零样本和监督微调评估视觉语言模型的下界性能；2. 采用Fine-tune-CoT利用教师模型生成的高质量推理数据微调小模型；3. 提出动态CoT策略，在训练过程中自适应注入CoT数据，使模型在推理阶段能灵活运用推理能力。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验结果表明，所提出的方法具有有效性，能够显著提升多模态关键词预测的性能。

Conclusion: 通过视觉语言模型结合CoT推理策略，可以有效解决多模态关键词预测中的挑战，特别是在处理缺失和未见场景时表现出色。动态CoT策略进一步优化了模型的推理灵活性。

Abstract: Multi-modal keyphrase prediction (MMKP) aims to advance beyond text-only
methods by incorporating multiple modalities of input information to produce a
set of conclusive phrases. Traditional multi-modal approaches have been proven
to have significant limitations in handling the challenging absence and unseen
scenarios. Additionally, we identify shortcomings in existing benchmarks that
overestimate model capability due to significant overlap in training tests. In
this work, we propose leveraging vision-language models (VLMs) for the MMKP
task. Firstly, we use two widely-used strategies, e.g., zero-shot and
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to assess the lower bound performance of VLMs.
Next, to improve the complex reasoning capabilities of VLMs, we adopt
Fine-tune-CoT, which leverages high-quality CoT reasoning data generated by a
teacher model to finetune smaller models. Finally, to address the
"overthinking" phenomenon, we propose a dynamic CoT strategy which adaptively
injects CoT data during training, allowing the model to flexibly leverage its
reasoning capabilities during the inference stage. We evaluate the proposed
strategies on various datasets and the experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed approaches. The code is available at

Motivation: 现有的推理基准主要评估基于语言的推理，将视觉输入视为可替换的上下文，缺乏对视觉中心推理的评估。

Method: 整合了七种视觉挑战类型、自然对抗图像对以及带注释的推理链，用于细粒度评估推理过程而非仅最终答案。

Result: BLINK-Twice对当前模型构成重大挑战，现有语言空间推理策略效果不稳定且冗余，重复图像观察和主动视觉交互能提升性能。

Conclusion: 需要新的视觉推理范式，主动视觉交互展示了改进方向，数据集已公开可用。

Abstract: Recently, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have made rapid progress,
particularly in enhancing their reasoning capabilities. However, existing
reasoning benchmarks still primarily assess language-based reasoning, often
treating visual input as replaceable context. To address this gap, we introduce
BLINK-Twice, a vision-centric reasoning benchmark grounded in challenging
perceptual tasks. Instead of relying on external knowledge, our tasks require
models to reason from visual content alone, shifting the focus from
language-based to image-grounded reasoning. Compared to prior perception
benchmarks, it moves beyond shallow perception ("see") and requires
fine-grained observation and analytical reasoning ("observe"). BLINK-Twice
integrates three core components: seven types of visual challenges for testing
visual reasoning, natural adversarial image pairs that enforce reliance on
visual content, and annotated reasoning chains for fine-grained evaluation of
the reasoning process rather than final answers alone. We evaluate 20 leading
MLLMs, including 12 foundation models and 8 reasoning-enhanced models.
BLINK-Twice poses a significant challenge to current models. While existing
reasoning strategies in the language space-such as chain-of-thought or
self-criticism can improve performance, they often result in unstable and
redundant reasoning. We observe that repeated image observation improves
performance across models, and active visual interaction, as demonstrated by
models like o3, highlights the need for a new paradigm for vision reasoning.

TL;DR: VAD-GS是一个针对挑战性城市场景的3D高斯泼溅框架，通过体素可见性推理、多样性感知视图选择和基于块匹配的多视图立体重建来恢复缺失的几何结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D高斯泼溅的性能严重依赖初始点云质量，在无边界动态城市场景中，由于观测视锥体不重叠，往往导致点云覆盖不均匀不完整，训练时会产生失真和伪影。

Method: 使用体素可见性推理识别不可靠几何结构，通过多样性感知视图选择信息丰富的支持视图，采用基于块匹配的多视图立体重建恢复缺失结构。

Result: 在Waymo和nuScenes数据集上的大量实验表明，VAD-GS优于最先进的3DGS方法，显著提高了静态和动态对象重建几何的质量。

Conclusion: VAD-GS能够生成由可靠几何先验引导的新高斯基元，即使在缺乏初始点的区域也能有效恢复几何结构。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated impressive performance in
synthesizing high-fidelity novel views. Nonetheless, its effectiveness
critically depends on the quality of the initialized point cloud. Specifically,
achieving uniform and complete point coverage over the underlying scene
structure requires overlapping observation frustums, an assumption that is
often violated in unbounded, dynamic urban environments. Training Gaussian
models with partially initialized point clouds often leads to distortions and
artifacts, as camera rays may fail to intersect valid surfaces, resulting in
incorrect gradient propagation to Gaussian primitives associated with occluded
or invisible geometry. Additionally, existing densification strategies simply
clone and split Gaussian primitives from existing ones, incapable of
reconstructing missing structures. To address these limitations, we propose
VAD-GS, a 3DGS framework tailored for geometry recovery in challenging urban
scenes. Our method identifies unreliable geometry structures via voxel-based
visibility reasoning, selects informative supporting views through
diversity-aware view selection, and recovers missing structures via patch
matching-based multi-view stereo reconstruction. This design enables the
generation of new Gaussian primitives guided by reliable geometric priors, even
in regions lacking initial points. Extensive experiments on the Waymo and
nuScenes datasets demonstrate that VAD-GS outperforms state-of-the-art 3DGS
approaches and significantly improves the quality of reconstructed geometry for
both static and dynamic objects. Source code will be released upon publication.

Motivation: 准确量化森林生物量对碳循环监测至关重要。虽然机载LiDAR能捕捉3D森林结构，但由于难以建模长程依赖关系来区分树木，直接从点云估计木质体积和地上生物量具有挑战性。

Method: 将Mamba模型的选择性状态空间模型集成到Minkowski网络中，有效编码全局上下文和长程依赖关系以改进树木区分。加入跳跃连接来增强特征并加速收敛。

Conclusion: 该工作为大规模森林生物量分析提供了强大工具，推进了基于LiDAR的森林调查。

Abstract: Accurate forest biomass quantification is vital for carbon cycle monitoring.
While airborne LiDAR excels at capturing 3D forest structure, directly
estimating woody volume and Aboveground Biomass (AGB) from point clouds is
challenging due to difficulties in modeling long-range dependencies needed to
distinguish trees.We propose Minkowski-MambaNet, a novel deep learning
framework that directly estimates volume and AGB from raw LiDAR. Its key
innovation is integrating the Mamba model's Selective State Space Model (SSM)
into a Minkowski network, enabling effective encoding of global context and
long-range dependencies for improved tree differentiation. Skip connections are
incorporated to enhance features and accelerate convergence.Evaluated on Danish
National Forest Inventory LiDAR data, Minkowski-MambaNet significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art methods, providing more accurate and robust
estimates. Crucially, it requires no Digital Terrain Model (DTM) and is robust
to boundary artifacts. This work offers a powerful tool for large-scale forest
biomass analysis, advancing LiDAR-based forest inventories.

Motivation: 基于transformer的模型在视觉任务中推理效率仍然是一个挑战，特别是在目标检测等任务中。研究旨在利用DETR中MLP层固有的稀疏性来提高推理效率。

Method: 提出了两种方法：SIBS（基于固定激活模式的启发式方法预测神经元不活动）和MGS（在预训练DETR上训练的轻量级门控机制，使用小型线性层预测动态稀疏性）。

Result: 在COCO数据集上的实验表明，MGS能够保持甚至提升性能，同时显著减少计算量，实现85-95%的激活稀疏度。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种实用、输入自适应的稀疏化方法，能够在无需完全模型重新训练的情况下，实现预训练视觉transformer的高效部署。

Abstract: Efficient inference with transformer-based models remains a challenge,
especially in vision tasks like object detection. We analyze the inherent
sparsity in the MLP layers of DETR and introduce two methods to exploit it
without retraining. First, we propose Static Indicator-Based Sparsification
(SIBS), a heuristic method that predicts neuron inactivity based on fixed
activation patterns. While simple, SIBS offers limited gains due to the
input-dependent nature of sparsity. To address this, we introduce Micro-Gated
Sparsification (MGS), a lightweight gating mechanism trained on top of a
pretrained DETR. MGS predicts dynamic sparsity using a small linear layer and
achieves up to 85 to 95% activation sparsity. Experiments on the COCO dataset
show that MGS maintains or even improves performance while significantly
reducing computation. Our method offers a practical, input-adaptive approach to
sparsification, enabling efficient deployment of pretrained vision transformers
without full model retraining.

Motivation: 从单目视频重建的4D场景基于文本提示进行编辑是一个有价值但具有挑战性的任务，关键难点在于在复杂动态场景的局部区域实现语义精确编辑，同时保持未编辑内容的完整性。

Method: 方法包括：1）用量化CLIP特征增强3D高斯形成语言嵌入动态表示；2）两阶段点级定位策略，先通过CLIP相似性选择候选高斯，再细化空间范围；3）使用基于扩散的视频编辑模型在定位区域进行针对性编辑，通过流和涂鸦引导确保空间保真度和时间一致性。

Conclusion: Mono4DEditor提供了一个灵活准确的文本驱动4D场景编辑框架，成功解决了复杂动态场景中局部语义精确编辑的挑战。

Abstract: Editing 4D scenes reconstructed from monocular videos based on text prompts
is a valuable yet challenging task with broad applications in content creation
and virtual environments. The key difficulty lies in achieving semantically
precise edits in localized regions of complex, dynamic scenes, while preserving
the integrity of unedited content. To address this, we introduce Mono4DEditor,
a novel framework for flexible and accurate text-driven 4D scene editing. Our
method augments 3D Gaussians with quantized CLIP features to form a
language-embedded dynamic representation, enabling efficient semantic querying
of arbitrary spatial regions. We further propose a two-stage point-level
localization strategy that first selects candidate Gaussians via CLIP
similarity and then refines their spatial extent to improve accuracy. Finally,
targeted edits are performed on localized regions using a diffusion-based video
editing model, with flow and scribble guidance ensuring spatial fidelity and
temporal coherence. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Mono4DEditor enables
high-quality, text-driven edits across diverse scenes and object types, while
preserving the appearance and geometry of unedited areas and surpassing prior
approaches in both flexibility and visual fidelity.

Abstract: Low-light video enhancement (LLVE) is challenging due to noise, low contrast,
and color degradations. Learning-based approaches offer fast inference but
still struggle with heavy noise in real low-light scenes, primarily due to
limitations in effectively leveraging temporal information. In this paper, we
address this issue with DWTA-Net, a novel two-stage framework that jointly
exploits short- and long-term temporal cues. Stage I employs Visual State-Space
blocks for multi-frame alignment, recovering brightness, color, and structure
with local consistency. Stage II introduces a recurrent refinement module with
dynamic weight-based temporal aggregation guided by optical flow, adaptively
balancing static and dynamic regions. A texture-adaptive loss further preserves
fine details while promoting smoothness in flat areas. Experiments on
real-world low-light videos show that DWTA-Net effectively suppresses noise and
artifacts, delivering superior visual quality compared with state-of-the-art
methods.

TL;DR: 提出了SilvaScenes数据集，用于从林下图像进行树种实例分割，包含24个物种的1476棵树，在复杂自然环境中评估现代深度学习方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 森林管理中的机器人技术面临复杂自然环境下的感知挑战，现有数据集主要关注城市环境或物种有限，无法满足精确林业和生物多样性监测的需求。

Method: 在加拿大魁北克五个生物气候区域收集林下图像数据，由林业专家标注，包含24个物种的1476棵树，用于实例分割基准测试。

Result: 树木分割相对容易（最高mAP 67.65%），但树种分类仍然具有挑战性（mAP仅35.69%）。

Conclusion: SilvaScenes数据集填补了森林环境中树种识别数据集的空白，展示了树种分类在复杂自然条件下的技术挑战。

Abstract: Interest in robotics for forest management is growing, but perception in
complex, natural environments remains a significant hurdle. Conditions such as
heavy occlusion, variable lighting, and dense vegetation pose challenges to
automated systems, which are essential for precision forestry, biodiversity
monitoring, and the automation of forestry equipment. These tasks rely on
advanced perceptual capabilities, such as detection and fine-grained species
classification of individual trees. Yet, existing datasets are inadequate to
develop such perception systems, as they often focus on urban settings or a
limited number of species. To address this, we present SilvaScenes, a new
dataset for instance segmentation of tree species from under-canopy images.
Collected across five bioclimatic domains in Quebec, Canada, SilvaScenes
features 1476 trees from 24 species with annotations from forestry experts. We
demonstrate the relevance and challenging nature of our dataset by benchmarking
modern deep learning approaches for instance segmentation. Our results show
that, while tree segmentation is easy, with a top mean average precision (mAP)
of 67.65%, species classification remains a significant challenge with an mAP
of only 35.69%. Our dataset and source code will be available at

Motivation: 对比视觉语言模型存在由跨模态单一主导特征维度引起的模态间隙问题，这些主导维度具有高预测敏感性，限制其影响可以改善校准误差。

Method: 提出维度熵最大化方法，通过正则化文本特征分布使其趋向均匀分布，从而减轻主导维度的依赖性。

Result: 该方法缓解了测试时提示调优中校准性能的退化，为实际部署场景中视觉语言模型的可靠性提供了简单有效的解决方案。

Conclusion: 维度熵最大化是一种有效的方法，能够提升视觉语言模型在测试时适应中的校准性能和可靠性。

Abstract: Test-time adaptation paradigm provides flexibility towards domain shifts by
performing immediate adaptation on unlabeled target data from the source model.
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) leverage their generalization capabilities for
diverse downstream tasks, and test-time prompt tuning has emerged as a
prominent solution for adapting VLMs. In this work, we explore contrastive VLMs
and identify the modality gap caused by a single dominant feature dimension
across modalities. We observe that the dominant dimensions in both text and
image modalities exhibit high predictive sensitivity, and that constraining
their influence can improve calibration error. Building on this insight, we
propose dimensional entropy maximization that regularizes the distribution of
textual features toward uniformity to mitigate the dependency of dominant
dimensions. Our method alleviates the degradation of calibration performance in
test-time prompt tuning, offering a simple yet effective solution to enhance
the reliability of VLMs in real-world deployment scenarios.

TL;DR: 提出一种基于DreamBooth的少样本角色生成方法，通过多token策略和LoRA微调，在保留参考角色艺术风格的同时生成无限多样的新角色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决动画和游戏行业中需要大量新颖角色但设计资源有限的问题，旨在通过AI技术自动生成保持特定艺术风格的角色。

Method: 基于DreamBooth框架，采用多token策略（为单个角色和集体风格分配独立token），结合LoRA参数高效微调，移除类别特定正则化集，在生成时引入随机token和嵌入。

Result: 在五个小型专业数据集上的评估显示，该方法能生成高质量、多样化的角色，同时保持参考角色的独特美学特征，人类评估进一步验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法成功实现了在少量参考角色基础上生成无限新角色的目标，为动画、游戏等创意产业提供了强大的角色生成工具。

Abstract: The audiovisual industry is undergoing a profound transformation as it is
integrating AI developments not only to automate routine tasks but also to
inspire new forms of art. This paper addresses the problem of producing a
virtually unlimited number of novel characters that preserve the artistic style
and shared visual traits of a small set of human-designed reference characters,
thus broadening creative possibilities in animation, gaming, and related
domains. Our solution builds upon DreamBooth, a well-established fine-tuning
technique for text-to-image diffusion models, and adapts it to tackle two core
challenges: capturing intricate character details beyond textual prompts and
the few-shot nature of the training data. To achieve this, we propose a
multi-token strategy, using clustering to assign separate tokens to individual
characters and their collective style, combined with LoRA-based
parameter-efficient fine-tuning. By removing the class-specific regularization
set and introducing random tokens and embeddings during generation, our
approach allows for unlimited character creation while preserving the learned
style. We evaluate our method on five small specialized datasets, comparing it
to relevant baselines using both quantitative metrics and a human evaluation
study. Our results demonstrate that our approach produces high-quality, diverse
characters while preserving the distinctive aesthetic features of the reference
characters, with human evaluation further reinforcing its effectiveness and
highlighting the potential of our method.

Abstract: Interactive segmentation is a promising strategy for building robust,
generalisable algorithms for volumetric medical image segmentation. However,
inconsistent and clinically unrealistic evaluation hinders fair comparison and
misrepresents real-world performance. We propose a clinically grounded
methodology for defining evaluation tasks and metrics, and built a software
framework for constructing standardised evaluation pipelines. We evaluate
state-of-the-art algorithms across heterogeneous and complex tasks and observe
that (i) minimising information loss when processing user interactions is
critical for model robustness, (ii) adaptive-zooming mechanisms boost
robustness and speed convergence, (iii) performance drops if validation
prompting behaviour/budgets differ from training, (iv) 2D methods perform well
with slab-like images and coarse targets, but 3D context helps with large or
irregularly shaped targets, (v) performance of non-medical-domain models (e.g.
SAM2) degrades with poor contrast and complex shapes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工具使用、理解和创造是人类智能的标志，但现代MLLM对物理工具的真正理解程度尚未量化，需要专门的评估基准。

Method: 构建包含1000多个图像-文本对的VQA数据集，评估32个MLLM在工具识别、工具理解和工具创造三个层次的能力。

Result: 评估显示MLLM在工具理解方面存在显著缺陷，特别是在工具原理理解和创造性工具制作方面表现不佳。

Conclusion: 当前MLLM对物理工具的理解能力有限，需要进一步改进，作者提供了初步解决方案和公开的数据集与代码。

Abstract: The ability to use, understand, and create tools is a hallmark of human
intelligence, enabling sophisticated interaction with the physical world. For
any general-purpose intelligent agent to achieve true versatility, it must also
master these fundamental skills. While modern Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) leverage their extensive common knowledge for high-level planning in
embodied AI and in downstream Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, the extent
of their true understanding of physical tools remains unquantified. To bridge
this gap, we present PhysToolBench, the first benchmark dedicated to evaluating
the comprehension of physical tools by MLLMs. Our benchmark is structured as a
Visual Question Answering (VQA) dataset comprising over 1,000 image-text pairs.
It assesses capabilities across three distinct difficulty levels: (1) Tool
Recognition: Requiring the recognition of a tool's primary function. (2) Tool
Understanding: Testing the ability to grasp the underlying principles of a
tool's operation. (3) Tool Creation: Challenging the model to fashion a new
tool from surrounding objects when conventional options are unavailable. Our
comprehensive evaluation of 32 MLLMs-spanning proprietary, open-source,
specialized embodied, and backbones in VLAs-reveals a significant deficiency in
tool understanding. Furthermore, we provide an in-depth analysis and propose
preliminary solutions. Code and dataset are publicly available.

Method: 分析Galaxy S和A系列模型的共同模式，比较原始图像和普通图像的差异，探索伪影在法证中的应用

Result: 发现某些Galaxy S系列模型存在导致指纹碰撞的共同模式，原始图像可可靠进行PRNU验证，对角线伪影可用于减少HDR误检和定位人像模式合成虚化区域

Conclusion: 对角线伪影对PRNU验证构成挑战，但原始图像可规避此问题，同时这些伪影在法证分析中具有应用价值

Abstract: We investigate diagonal artifacts present in images captured by several
Samsung smartphones and their impact on PRNU-based camera source verification.
We first show that certain Galaxy S series models share a common pattern
causing fingerprint collisions, with a similar issue also found in some Galaxy
A models. Next, we demonstrate that reliable PRNU verification remains feasible
for devices supporting PRO mode with raw capture, since raw images bypass the
processing pipeline that introduces artifacts. This option, however, is not
available for the mid-range A series models or in forensic cases without access
to raw images. Finally, we outline potential forensic applications of the
diagonal artifacts, such as reducing misdetections in HDR images and localizing
regions affected by synthetic bokeh in portrait-mode images.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决航拍图像中小目标检测由于有限像素表示在特征提取过程中信息严重退化的问题，现有FPN方法通过后处理增强但重建细节常偏离原始图像信息。

Method: 提出PRNet框架，包含渐进细化颈部(PRN)通过骨干网络重用和迭代细化实现空间-语义对齐，以及增强切片采样(ESSamp)通过优化重排和卷积在下采样过程中保留浅层信息。

Result: 在VisDrone、AI-TOD和UAVDT数据集上的广泛实验表明，PRNet在可比计算约束下优于最先进方法。

Conclusion: PRNet通过优先保留和有效利用原始浅层空间特征，成功提升了小目标检测性能，实现了优越的精度-效率平衡。

Abstract: Small object detection in aerial images suffers from severe information
degradation during feature extraction due to limited pixel representations,
where shallow spatial details fail to align effectively with semantic
information, leading to frequent misses and false positives. Existing FPN-based
methods attempt to mitigate these losses through post-processing enhancements,
but the reconstructed details often deviate from the original image
information, impeding their fusion with semantic content. To address this
limitation, we propose PRNet, a real-time detection framework that prioritizes
the preservation and efficient utilization of primitive shallow spatial
features to enhance small object representations. PRNet achieves this via two
modules:the Progressive Refinement Neck (PRN) for spatial-semantic alignment
through backbone reuse and iterative refinement, and the Enhanced SliceSamp
(ESSamp) for preserving shallow information during downsampling via optimized
rearrangement and convolution. Extensive experiments on the VisDrone, AI-TOD,
and UAVDT datasets demonstrate that PRNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods
under comparable computational constraints, achieving superior
accuracy-efficiency trade-offs.

Motivation: 传统多层感知机作为隐式神经表示进行形变时，需要昂贵的正则化，导致训练不稳定且特征对齐效果不佳。

Method: 将形变重新定义为微分向量流的构造，通过将结构流属性直接编码到网络架构中，确保变换的连续性和可逆性。

Result: 在面部形变、图像形变和高斯溅射形变等应用中，FLOWING实现了最先进的形变质量，且收敛更快。

Conclusion: 基于流的方法提供了原则性和稳定的变换，能够实现准确且保持结构的形变效果。

Abstract: Morphing is a long-standing problem in vision and computer graphics,
requiring a time-dependent warping for feature alignment and a blending for
smooth interpolation. Recently, multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) have been
explored as implicit neural representations (INRs) for modeling such
deformations, due to their meshlessness and differentiability; however,
extracting coherent and accurate morphings from standard MLPs typically relies
on costly regularizations, which often lead to unstable training and prevent
effective feature alignment. To overcome these limitations, we propose FLOWING
(FLOW morphING), a framework that recasts warping as the construction of a
differential vector flow, naturally ensuring continuity, invertibility, and
temporal coherence by encoding structural flow properties directly into the
network architectures. This flow-centric approach yields principled and stable
transformations, enabling accurate and structure-preserving morphing of both 2D
images and 3D shapes. Extensive experiments across a range of applications -
including face and image morphing, as well as Gaussian Splatting morphing -
show that FLOWING achieves state-of-the-art morphing quality with faster
convergence. Code and pretrained models are available at

TL;DR: TC-LoRA提出了一种动态权重调节的扩散模型控制方法，通过超网络在每个扩散步骤生成LoRA适配器，实现条件引导的自适应策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有可控扩散模型使用静态架构修改中间激活来注入条件引导，这种方法在多阶段去噪过程中采用固定策略，限制了模型从粗到细生成过程中的适应能力。

Method: 使用超网络根据时间和用户条件为冻结的主干网络在每个扩散步骤动态生成LoRA适配器，直接调节模型权重而非中间激活。

Result: 在各种数据域上的实验表明，这种动态参数化控制相比静态激活方法显著提高了生成保真度和空间条件遵循度。

Conclusion: TC-LoRA建立了一种新范式，通过更深层的权重功能适应来修改模型的调节策略，使控制能够与任务和生成阶段的动态需求保持一致。

Abstract: Current controllable diffusion models typically rely on fixed architectures
that modify intermediate activations to inject guidance conditioned on a new
modality. This approach uses a static conditioning strategy for a dynamic,
multi-stage denoising process, limiting the model's ability to adapt its
response as the generation evolves from coarse structure to fine detail. We
introduce TC-LoRA (Temporally Modulated Conditional LoRA), a new paradigm that
enables dynamic, context-aware control by conditioning the model's weights
directly. Our framework uses a hypernetwork to generate LoRA adapters
on-the-fly, tailoring weight modifications for the frozen backbone at each
diffusion step based on time and the user's condition. This mechanism enables
the model to learn and execute an explicit, adaptive strategy for applying
conditional guidance throughout the entire generation process. Through
experiments on various data domains, we demonstrate that this dynamic,
parametric control significantly enhances generative fidelity and adherence to
spatial conditions compared to static, activation-based methods. TC-LoRA
establishes an alternative approach in which the model's conditioning strategy
is modified through a deeper functional adaptation of its weights, allowing
control to align with the dynamic demands of the task and generative stage.

Motivation: 生物医学目标检测面临标注数据稀缺和新类别频繁出现的挑战，需要能够同时处理少样本检测、开放集识别和跨任务泛化的统一解决方案。

Method: 基于类别无关的DETR骨干网络，从原始支持图像构建类别原型，使用增强视图和轻量级transformer解码器学习嵌入空间，通过原型匹配损失、对齐分离损失和KL散度正则化联合优化。

Result: 在卵细胞、血细胞和疟疾检测任务上的广泛实验表明，FSP-DETR显著优于先前的少样本和基于原型的检测器，特别是在少样本和开放集场景下表现优异。

Conclusion: FSP-DETR提供了一个统一的检测框架，能够在推理时灵活支持未知类别识别、背景拒绝和跨任务适应，无需重新训练，为生物医学目标检测提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Object detection in biomedical settings is fundamentally constrained by the
scarcity of labeled data and the frequent emergence of novel or rare
categories. We present FSP-DETR, a unified detection framework that enables
robust few-shot detection, open-set recognition, and generalization to unseen
biomedical tasks within a single model. Built upon a class-agnostic DETR
backbone, our approach constructs class prototypes from original support images
and learns an embedding space using augmented views and a lightweight
transformer decoder. Training jointly optimizes a prototype matching loss, an
alignment-based separation loss, and a KL divergence regularization to improve
discriminative feature learning and calibration under scarce supervision.
Unlike prior work that tackles these tasks in isolation, FSP-DETR enables
inference-time flexibility to support unseen class recognition, background
rejection, and cross-task adaptation without retraining. We also introduce a
new ova species detection benchmark with 20 parasite classes and establish
standardized evaluation protocols. Extensive experiments across ova, blood
cell, and malaria detection tasks demonstrate that FSP-DETR significantly
outperforms prior few-shot and prototype-based detectors, especially in
low-shot and open-set scenarios.

Abstract: We present a transparent, reproducible measurement of research trends across
26,104 accepted papers from CVPR, ICLR, and NeurIPS spanning 2023-2025. Titles
and abstracts are normalized, phrase-protected, and matched against a
hand-crafted lexicon to assign up to 35 topical labels and mine fine-grained
cues about tasks, architectures, training regimes, objectives, datasets, and
co-mentioned modalities. The analysis quantifies three macro shifts: (1) a
sharp rise of multimodal vision-language-LLM work, which increasingly reframes
classic perception as instruction following and multi-step reasoning; (2)
steady expansion of generative methods, with diffusion research consolidating
around controllability, distillation, and speed; and (3) resilient 3D and video
activity, with composition moving from NeRFs to Gaussian splatting and a
growing emphasis on human- and agent-centric understanding. Within VLMs,
parameter-efficient adaptation like prompting/adapters/LoRA and lightweight
vision-language bridges dominate; training practice shifts from building
encoders from scratch to instruction tuning and finetuning strong backbones;
contrastive objectives recede relative to cross-entropy/ranking and
distillation. Cross-venue comparisons show CVPR has a stronger 3D footprint and
ICLR the highest VLM share, while reliability themes such as efficiency or
robustness diffuse across areas. We release the lexicon and methodology to
enable auditing and extension. Limitations include lexicon recall and
abstract-only scope, but the longitudinal signals are consistent across venues
and years.

Abstract: With the current surge in spatial reasoning explorations, researchers have
made significant progress in understanding indoor scenes, but still struggle
with diverse applications such as robotics and autonomous driving. This paper
aims to advance all-scale spatial reasoning across diverse scenarios by
tackling two key challenges: 1) the heavy reliance on indoor 3D scans and
labor-intensive manual annotations for dataset curation; 2) the absence of
effective all-scale scene modeling, which often leads to overfitting to
individual scenes. In this paper, we introduce a holistic solution that
integrates a structured spatial reasoning knowledge system, scale-aware
modeling, and a progressive training paradigm, as the first attempt to broaden
the all-scale spatial intelligence of MLLMs to the best of our knowledge. Using
a task-specific, specialist-driven automated pipeline, we curate over 38K video
scenes across 5 spatial scales to create SpaceVista-1M, a dataset comprising
approximately 1M spatial QA pairs spanning 19 diverse task types. While
specialist models can inject useful domain knowledge, they are not reliable for
evaluation. We then build an all-scale benchmark with precise annotations by
manually recording, retrieving, and assembling video-based data. However, naive
training with SpaceVista-1M often yields suboptimal results due to the
potential knowledge conflict. Accordingly, we introduce SpaceVista-7B, a
spatial reasoning model that accepts dense inputs beyond semantics and uses
scale as an anchor for scale-aware experts and progressive rewards. Finally,
extensive evaluations across 5 benchmarks, including our SpaceVista-Bench,
demonstrate competitive performance, showcasing strong generalization across
all scales and scenarios. Our dataset, model, and benchmark will be released on

Motivation: 视觉语言动作模型训练成本高昂，需要更高效的方法来为预训练视觉语言模型添加动作能力。

Method: 采用两阶段训练策略：首先将VLM隐藏状态映射到小型动作模型的动作空间，然后选择性微调语言模型、状态编码器和动作模块。

Result: 在LIBERO上达到97.3%平均成功率（提升11.8%），在LIBERO-LONG上达到93.5%（提升24.5%），真实世界实验中比教师模型提升17%。

Conclusion: 动作蒸馏能有效让VLM生成精确动作，同时大幅降低训练成本。

Abstract: Vision-Language Action (VLA) models significantly advance robotic
manipulation by leveraging the strong perception capabilities of pretrained
vision-language models (VLMs). By integrating action modules into these
pretrained models, VLA methods exhibit improved generalization. However,
training them from scratch is costly. In this work, we propose a simple yet
effective distillation-based framework that equips VLMs with action-execution
capability by transferring knowledge from pretrained small action models. Our
architecture retains the original VLM structure, adding only an action token
and a state encoder to incorporate physical inputs. To distill action
knowledge, we adopt a two-stage training strategy. First, we perform
lightweight alignment by mapping VLM hidden states into the action space of the
small action model, enabling effective reuse of its pretrained action decoder
and avoiding expensive pretraining. Second, we selectively fine-tune the
language model, state encoder, and action modules, enabling the system to
integrate multimodal inputs with precise action generation. Specifically, the
action token provides the VLM with a direct handle for predicting future
actions, while the state encoder allows the model to incorporate robot dynamics
not captured by vision alone. This design yields substantial efficiency gains
over training large VLA models from scratch. Compared with previous
state-of-the-art methods, our method achieves 97.3% average success rate on
LIBERO (11.8% improvement) and 93.5% on LIBERO-LONG (24.5% improvement). In
real-world experiments across five manipulation tasks, our method consistently
outperforms the teacher model, achieving 82.0% success rate (17% improvement),
which demonstrate that action distillation effectively enables VLMs to generate
precise actions while substantially reducing training costs.

Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在处理无限视频流时面临计算成本高、延迟大和内存使用过多的问题，需要一种能够实时稳定理解长视频的方法。

Method: 采用统一的训练推理框架，在推理时维护紧凑的KV缓存（重用注意力sink状态、近期视觉token短窗口和文本token长窗口），通过简单的监督微调策略在短重叠视频块上应用完整注意力。

Result: 在Inf-Streams-Eval基准测试中，StreamingVLM以66.18%的胜率击败GPT-4O mini，在单张NVIDIA H100上保持高达8 FPS的稳定实时性能，同时在LongVideoBench和OVOBench Realtime上分别提升4.30和5.96分。

Conclusion: StreamingVLM成功解决了长视频处理的效率和延迟问题，通过创新的训练策略实现了实时稳定的无限视频流理解，同时提升了通用视觉问答能力。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) could power real-time assistants and autonomous
agents, but they face a critical challenge: understanding near-infinite video
streams without escalating latency and memory usage. Processing entire videos
with full attention leads to quadratic computational costs and poor performance
on long videos. Meanwhile, simple sliding window methods are also flawed, as
they either break coherence or suffer from high latency due to redundant
recomputation. In this paper, we introduce StreamingVLM, a model designed for
real-time, stable understanding of infinite visual input. Our approach is a
unified framework that aligns training with streaming inference. During
inference, we maintain a compact KV cache by reusing states of attention sinks,
a short window of recent vision tokens, and a long window of recent text
tokens. This streaming ability is instilled via a simple supervised fine-tuning
(SFT) strategy that applies full attention on short, overlapped video chunks,
which effectively mimics the inference-time attention pattern without training
on prohibitively long contexts. For evaluation, we build Inf-Streams-Eval, a
new benchmark with videos averaging over two hours that requires dense,
per-second alignment between frames and text. On Inf-Streams-Eval, StreamingVLM
achieves a 66.18% win rate against GPT-4O mini and maintains stable, real-time
performance at up to 8 FPS on a single NVIDIA H100. Notably, our SFT strategy
also enhances general VQA abilities without any VQA-specific fine-tuning,
improving performance on LongVideoBench by +4.30 and OVOBench Realtime by
+5.96. Code is available at https://github.com/mit-han-lab/streaming-vlm.

### [94] [Enhancing Biomedical Named Entity Recognition using GLiNER-BioMed with Targeted Dictionary-Based Post-processing for BioASQ 2025 task 6](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08588)
*Ritesh Mehta*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 评估GLiNER-BioMed模型在BioASQ数据集上的表现，引入基于词典的后处理策略解决实体分类错误，在开发集上提升F1分数但未能在盲测集上泛化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生物医学命名实体识别面临区分相似实体类型（如基因和化学物质）的挑战，需要改进模型性能。

Method: 使用GLiNER-BioMed模型，并引入基于词典的后处理策略来修正常见误分类，同时探索了条件随机场等替代方法。

Result: 后处理在开发集上将微F1分数从0.79提升到0.83，但在盲测集上反而下降至0.77（基线为0.79），表明存在过拟合问题。

Conclusion: 基于词典的细化对预训练BioNER模型有潜力，但需解决对开发数据的过拟合问题，确保在真实场景中的鲁棒泛化能力。

Abstract: Biomedical Named Entity Recognition (BioNER), task6 in BioASQ (A challenge in
large-scale biomedical semantic indexing and question answering), is crucial
for extracting information from scientific literature but faces hurdles such as
distinguishing between similar entity types like genes and chemicals. This
study evaluates the GLiNER-BioMed model on a BioASQ dataset and introduces a
targeted dictionary-based post-processing strategy to address common
misclassifications. While this post-processing approach demonstrated notable
improvement on our development set, increasing the micro F1-score from a
baseline of 0.79 to 0.83, this enhancement did not generalize to the blind test
set, where the post-processed model achieved a micro F1-score of 0.77 compared
to the baselines 0.79. We also discuss insights gained from exploring
alternative methodologies, including Conditional Random Fields. This work
highlights the potential of dictionary-based refinement for pre-trained BioNER
models but underscores the critical challenge of overfitting to development
data and the necessity of ensuring robust generalization for real-world
applicability.

*Shahriar Kabir Nahin,Hadi Askari,Muhao Chen,Anshuman Chhabra*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现测试时缩放(TTS)方法存在一个未被识别的失败模式：当候选回答多样性受限时，TTS更容易产生不安全输出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 揭示TTS方法中关于候选多样性假设的潜在风险，证明多样性受限会导致安全漏洞。

Method: 提出RefDiv参考引导多样性减少协议作为诊断攻击，在四个开源模型和两种TTS策略上进行广泛实验。

Result: 限制多样性显著提高TTS产生不安全结果的概率，现有安全防护措施无法有效检测这种攻击。

Conclusion: TTS方法存在普遍的安全漏洞，需要设计既能有效又能抵御多样性针对性攻击的稳健TTS策略。

Abstract: Test-Time Scaling (TTS) improves LLM reasoning by exploring multiple
candidate responses and then operating over this set to find the best output. A
tacit premise behind TTS is that sufficiently diverse candidate pools enhance
reliability. In this work, we show that this assumption in TTS introduces a
previously unrecognized failure mode. When candidate diversity is curtailed,
even by a modest amount, TTS becomes much more likely to produce unsafe
outputs. We present a reference-guided diversity reduction protocol (RefDiv)
that serves as a diagnostic attack to stress test TTS pipelines. Through
extensive experiments across four open-source models (Qwen3, Mistral, Llama3.1,
Gemma3) and two widely used TTS strategies (Monte Carlo Tree Search and
Best-of-N), constraining diversity consistently signifies the rate at which TTS
produces unsafe results. The effect is often stronger than that produced by
prompts directly with high adversarial intent scores. This observed phenomenon
also transfers across TTS strategies and to closed-source models (e.g. OpenAI
o3 and Gemini-2.5-Pro), thus indicating that this is a general and extant
property of TTS rather than a model-specific artifact. Additionally, we find
that numerous widely used safety guardrail classifiers (e.g. Llama-Guard and
OpenAI Moderation API), are unable to flag the adversarial input prompts
generated by RefDiv, demonstrating that existing defenses offer limited
protection against this diversity-driven failure mode. Through this work, we
hope to motivate future research on designing robust TTS strategies that are
both effective and secure against diversity-targeted stress tests as
illustrated by RefDiv.

*Yuxin Li,Eng Siong Chng,Cuntai Guan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出HAREN-CTC架构，通过多任务学习和跨层注意力整合多层自监督学习特征，结合CTC损失处理稀疏时间监督，在语音抑郁检测任务上取得SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语音抑郁检测方法通常只使用自监督学习模型的最后一层或寻找单一最佳层，容易过拟合特定数据集，无法充分利用层次结构来检测细微且持续的抑郁信号。

Method: HAREN-CTC包含两个关键模块：层次自适应聚类模块将SSL特征重组为互补嵌入，跨模态融合模块通过跨注意力建模层间依赖关系，结合CTC损失实现对齐感知训练。

Result: 在DAIC-WOZ和MODMA数据集上分别达到0.81和0.82的macro F1分数，在标准数据划分和五折交叉验证的泛化设置下均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: HAREN-CTC通过有效整合多层SSL特征和CTC损失，能够更好地捕捉抑郁语音中的稀疏、异质时间模式，在语音抑郁检测任务上表现出优异的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Speech-based depression detection (SDD) is a promising, non-invasive
alternative to traditional clinical assessments. However, it remains limited by
the difficulty of extracting meaningful features and capturing sparse,
heterogeneous depressive cues over time. Pretrained self-supervised learning
(SSL) models such as WavLM provide rich, multi-layer speech representations,
yet most existing SDD methods rely only on the final layer or search for a
single best-performing one. These approaches often overfit to specific datasets
and fail to leverage the full hierarchical structure needed to detect subtle
and persistent depression signals.
  To address this challenge, we propose HAREN-CTC, a novel architecture that
integrates multi-layer SSL features using cross-attention within a multitask
learning framework, combined with Connectionist Temporal Classification loss to
handle sparse temporal supervision. HAREN-CTC comprises two key modules: a
Hierarchical Adaptive Clustering module that reorganizes SSL features into
complementary embeddings, and a Cross-Modal Fusion module that models
inter-layer dependencies through cross-attention. The CTC objective enables
alignment-aware training, allowing the model to track irregular temporal
patterns of depressive speech cues.
  We evaluate HAREN-CTC under both an upper-bound setting with standard data
splits and a generalization setting using five-fold cross-validation. The model
achieves state-of-the-art macro F1-scores of 0.81 on DAIC-WOZ and 0.82 on
MODMA, outperforming prior methods across both evaluation scenarios.

TL;DR: 提出了一个评估数学推理的新框架，通过分析GPT-3.5在GSM8K数据集上的推理步骤，识别出模型在组合推理等复杂模式上的严重缺陷。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估机器学习模型对数学的理解程度，超越传统基准测试，诊断具体的推理失败点。

Method: 使用GPT-3.5生成结构化推理步骤，然后用GPT-4o-mini进行错误分类和无监督聚类，识别推理模式。

Result: 发现模型在顺序计算等程序性模式上表现完美，但在需要组合推理的模式上性能急剧下降，显示出非人类式的脆弱性。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了更细粒度的数学理解评估方法，为开发新能力和更可靠的应用指明了方向。

Abstract: A central question in artificial intelligence is the extent to which machine
learning models comprehend mathematics. To address this, we propose a novel
framework for measuring mathematical reasoning that moves beyond standard
benchmarks to diagnose specific failure points. Our method first generates
structured, step-by-step reasoning from gpt-3.5-turbo on the GSM8K dataset. We
then use a more capable analyst model, gpt-4o-mini, to categorize errors and,
crucially, perform an unsupervised clustering of every reasoning sentence to
identify emergent "reasoning modes." This analysis reveals a cognitive profile
with a stark, nonhuman-like brittleness: while the model achieves near-perfect
accuracy on procedural modes like sequential calculation, its performance on
modes requiring combinatorial reasoning with restrictions plummets. By
identifying and quantifying the reliability of these distinct reasoning skills,
our work provides a more granular method to evaluate mathematical comprehension
and offers a precise roadmap for developing new capabilities and more reliable
future applications.

*V. S. Raghu Parupudi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出置信度分数(CS)作为替代自困惑度等无参考指标的方案，缓解传统指标对创意文本生成的偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统无参考指标如自困惑度对创意文本生成存在强烈偏见，需要更平衡的评估方法。

Method: 从模型输出概率分布中推导出置信度分数(CS)，在99个创意提示上测试其表现。

Result: CS在19%的情况下偏好新颖回复，而基于流畅度的指标为0%，差异显著(95% CI: [11.1%, 27.3%])。CS还能有效区分不同难度任务。

Conclusion: 置信度分数缓解了传统指标的创意偏见，同时保留了核心评估优势，为现代LLM提供更平衡的评估。

Abstract: Reference-free metrics like self-perplexity are strongly biased against
creative text generation. We propose the Confidence Score (CS), derived from a
model's output probability distribution, as a less biased alternative.
Experiments on gpt-4o-mini show that while fluency-based metrics prefer novel
responses in 0\% of cases on 99 creative prompts, our CS does so 19% of the
time, a statistically significant difference (95% CI for difference: [11.1%,
27.3%]). We also show that CS effectively distinguishes between easy, medium,
and hard tasks, confirmed by non-overlapping confidence intervals. The
Confidence Score thus mitigates the creativity bias of traditional metrics
while retaining their core evaluative strengths, offering a more balanced
assessment for modern LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Recover-LoRA是一种轻量级、数据集无关的方法，通过合成数据和logit蒸馏学习选择性层的LoRA适配器，恢复因量化、剪枝、序列化等优化导致的模型性能下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 推理优化（如量化、剪枝、格式转换、模型导出和序列化）可能导致语言模型任务性能的功能性退化。现有研究主要关注鲁棒量化技术，而本文关注从任何导致模型权重退化的来源恢复模型精度。

Method: 使用合成数据和logit蒸馏，在选择性层上学习LoRA适配器，将退化模型与其全精度模型对齐。

Result: 在多种小语言模型（包括MHA和GQA注意力架构）上，Recover-LoRA能够恢复5-17%的模型精度。

Conclusion: Recover-LoRA是一种有效的轻量级方法，能够从各种模型权重退化源中恢复模型精度，适用于不同注意力架构的小语言模型。

Abstract: Inference optimizations such as quantization, pruning, format and datatype
conversion, model export, and serialization can lead to functional degradations
in language model task performance. While most efforts on performance recovery
for deployment focus on robust quantization techniques, we focus on recovering
model accuracies from any sources that degrade model weights, such as improper
model serialization. In this work, we propose Recover-LoRA, a lightweight and
dataset agnostic method to recover accuracy in degraded models. Recover-LoRA
uses synthetic data and logit distillation to learn LoRA adapters on selective
layers that facilitate aligning the degraded model to its full precision model.
We investigate the utility of Recover-LoRA across a diverse set of small
language models (SLMs), including models with varying attention architectures,
multi-head attention (MHA) and group-query attention (GQA), as well as several
evaluation datasets. Our results show that Recover-LoRA recovers model
accuracies by 5-17% on MHA and GQA SLMs.

TL;DR: 提出了FinAuditing基准，用于评估LLM在财务审计任务中的表现，发现现有模型在结构化、多文档财务推理方面存在系统性限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GAAP的复杂性和XBRL的分层结构使财务审计难以自动化验证，而LLM在结构化、相互依赖的财务文档推理能力尚未充分探索。

Method: 构建FinAuditing基准，包含三个子任务：FinSM（语义一致性）、FinRE（关系一致性）、FinMR（数值一致性），并提出了统一的评估框架。

Result: 对13个最先进LLM的零样本实验显示，模型在语义、关系和数学维度表现不一致，处理分层多文档结构时准确率下降60-90%。

Conclusion: 现代LLM在基于分类法的财务推理中存在系统性限制，FinAuditing为开发可信赖、结构感知和法规对齐的财务智能系统奠定了基础。

Abstract: The complexity of the Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and the
hierarchical structure of eXtensible Business Reporting Language (XBRL) filings
make financial auditing increasingly difficult to automate and verify. While
large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in
unstructured text understanding, their ability to reason over structured,
interdependent, and taxonomy-driven financial documents remains largely
unexplored. To fill this gap, we introduce FinAuditing, the first
taxonomy-aligned, structure-aware, multi-document benchmark for evaluating LLMs
on financial auditing tasks. Built from real US-GAAP-compliant XBRL filings,
FinAuditing defines three complementary subtasks, FinSM for semantic
consistency, FinRE for relational consistency, and FinMR for numerical
consistency, each targeting a distinct aspect of structured auditing reasoning.
We further propose a unified evaluation framework integrating retrieval,
classification, and reasoning metrics across these subtasks. Extensive
zero-shot experiments on 13 state-of-the-art LLMs reveal that current models
perform inconsistently across semantic, relational, and mathematical
dimensions, with accuracy drops of up to 60-90% when reasoning over
hierarchical multi-document structures. Our findings expose the systematic
limitations of modern LLMs in taxonomy-grounded financial reasoning and
establish FinAuditing as a foundation for developing trustworthy,
structure-aware, and regulation-aligned financial intelligence systems. The
benchmark dataset is available at Hugging Face.

*Aneesh Jonelagadda,Christina Hahn,Haoze Zheng,Salvatore Penachio*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Mnemosyne是一个受人类记忆启发的无监督长期记忆架构，专为边缘设备上的大语言模型设计，通过图结构存储和记忆管理机制，在纵向医疗对话中实现了更好的长期记忆和自然响应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM记忆系统要么依赖暴力扩展上下文，要么使用静态检索管道，在边缘设备上表现不佳，特别是在纵向医疗助手等需要处理重复但时间上不同的对话场景中。

Method: 使用图结构存储、模块化内容和冗余过滤器、记忆提交和修剪机制，以及基于人类记忆建模的概率回忆（包含时间衰减和刷新过程），并引入从记忆图中高效提取的"核心摘要"来捕捉用户个性等长期细节。

Result: 在纵向医疗对话的盲测人类评估中，Mnemosyne在真实性和长期记忆能力方面获得65.8%的最高胜率（基线RAG为31.1%），在LoCoMo基准测试中在时间推理和单跳检索方面获得最高分，总体得分54.6%排名第二，优于Mem0和OpenAI等常用基线。

Conclusion: 通过边缘兼容且易于迁移的无监督记忆架构，可以实现改进的事实回忆、增强的时间推理和更自然的用户响应，特别适用于纵向医疗助手等应用场景。

Abstract: Long-term memory is essential for natural, realistic dialogue. However,
current large language model (LLM) memory systems rely on either brute-force
context expansion or static retrieval pipelines that fail on edge-constrained
devices. We introduce Mnemosyne, an unsupervised, human-inspired long-term
memory architecture designed for edge-based LLMs. Our approach uses
graph-structured storage, modular substance and redundancy filters, memory
committing and pruning mechanisms, and probabilistic recall with temporal decay
and refresh processes modeled after human memory. Mnemosyne also introduces a
concentrated "core summary" efficiently derived from a fixed-length subset of
the memory graph to capture the user's personality and other domain-specific
long-term details such as, using healthcare application as an example,
post-recovery ambitions and attitude towards care. Unlike existing
retrieval-augmented methods, Mnemosyne is designed for use in longitudinal
healthcare assistants, where repetitive and semantically similar but temporally
distinct conversations are limited by naive retrieval. In experiments with
longitudinal healthcare dialogues, Mnemosyne demonstrates the highest win rate
of 65.8% in blind human evaluations of realism and long-term memory capability
compared to a baseline RAG win rate of 31.1%. Mnemosyne also achieves current
highest LoCoMo benchmark scores in temporal reasoning and single-hop retrieval
compared to other same-backboned techniques. Further, the average overall score
of 54.6% was second highest across all methods, beating commonly used Mem0 and
OpenAI baselines among others. This demonstrates that improved factual recall,
enhanced temporal reasoning, and much more natural user-facing responses can be
feasible with an edge-compatible and easily transferable unsupervised memory
architecture.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出将AI生成文本检测重新定义为离群检测问题，将人类文本视为分布外样本，机器生成文本视为分布内样本，使用单类学习和基于分数的方法实现更好的泛化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将AI文本检测视为二分类问题，但人类文本并不构成统一的分布，这种二元化表述导致模型记忆OOD特征而非学习'非ID'行为的本质，限制了泛化能力。

Method: 使用单类学习方法（DeepSVDD和HRN）和基于分数的学习技术（能量方法），将人类文本作为分布外样本，机器生成文本作为分布内样本进行检测。

Result: 在DeepFake数据集上达到98.3%的AUROC和AUPR，FPR95仅为8.9%。在多语言、受攻击、未见模型和领域文本设置下均表现出鲁棒性和泛化性。

Conclusion: 将AI文本检测重新定义为OOD检测问题比传统二分类方法更有效，能够实现更好的泛化性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT,
DeepSeek, and Claude has significantly increased the presence of AI-generated
text in digital communication. This trend has heightened the need for reliable
detection methods to distinguish between human-authored and machine-generated
content. Existing approaches both zero-shot methods and supervised classifiers
largely conceptualize this task as a binary classification problem, often
leading to poor generalization across domains and models. In this paper, we
argue that such a binary formulation fundamentally mischaracterizes the
detection task by assuming a coherent representation of human-written texts. In
reality, human texts do not constitute a unified distribution, and their
diversity cannot be effectively captured through limited sampling. This causes
previous classifiers to memorize observed OOD characteristics rather than learn
the essence of `non-ID' behavior, limiting generalization to unseen
human-authored inputs. Based on this observation, we propose reframing the
detection task as an out-of-distribution (OOD) detection problem, treating
human-written texts as distributional outliers while machine-generated texts
are in-distribution (ID) samples. To this end, we develop a detection framework
using one-class learning method including DeepSVDD and HRN, and score-based
learning techniques such as energy-based method, enabling robust and
generalizable performance. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets
validate the effectiveness of our OOD-based approach. Specifically, the
OOD-based method achieves 98.3% AUROC and AUPR with only 8.9% FPR95 on DeepFake
dataset. Moreover, we test our detection framework on multilingual, attacked,
and unseen-model and -domain text settings, demonstrating the robustness and
generalizability of our framework. Code, pretrained weights, and demo will be
released.

TL;DR: YpathRAG是一个面向病理学的RAG框架，通过双通道混合检索和证据判断模块，显著提升了病理学领域的检索质量和事实可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在通用任务上表现出色，但在病理学等高门槛领域仍存在幻觉问题。现有方法依赖领域微调，但无法扩展知识边界或实施证据约束。

Method: 构建了包含28个子领域和153万段落的病理学向量数据库，开发了YpathRAG框架，包含双通道混合检索（BGE-M3密集检索+词汇引导稀疏检索）和基于LLM的支持性证据判断模块。

Result: 在YpathR基准上Recall@5达到98.64%，比基线提升23个百分点；在YpathQA-M基准上，通用和医学LLM的准确率平均提升9.0%，最高提升15.6%。

Conclusion: YpathRAG显著提高了检索质量和事实可靠性，为面向病理学的RAG提供了可扩展的构建范式和可解释的评估方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel on general tasks yet still hallucinate in
high-barrier domains such as pathology. Prior work often relies on domain
fine-tuning, which neither expands the knowledge boundary nor enforces
evidence-grounded constraints. We therefore build a pathology vector database
covering 28 subfields and 1.53 million paragraphs, and present YpathRAG, a
pathology-oriented RAG framework with dual-channel hybrid retrieval (BGE-M3
dense retrieval coupled with vocabulary-guided sparse retrieval) and an
LLM-based supportive-evidence judgment module that closes the
retrieval-judgment-generation loop. We also release two evaluation benchmarks,
YpathR and YpathQA-M. On YpathR, YpathRAG attains Recall@5 of 98.64%, a gain of
23 percentage points over the baseline; on YpathQA-M, a set of the 300 most
challenging questions, it increases the accuracies of both general and medical
LLMs by 9.0% on average and up to 15.6%. These results demonstrate improved
retrieval quality and factual reliability, providing a scalable construction
paradigm and interpretable evaluation for pathology-oriented RAG.

Result: LatentBreak生成的提示更短、困惑度更低，在多个安全对齐模型上优于其他越狱算法

Conclusion: 基于潜在空间语义替换的方法能有效生成低困惑度对抗提示，规避基于困惑度的防御机制

Abstract: Jailbreaks are adversarial attacks designed to bypass the built-in safety
mechanisms of large language models. Automated jailbreaks typically optimize an
adversarial suffix or adapt long prompt templates by forcing the model to
generate the initial part of a restricted or harmful response. In this work, we
show that existing jailbreak attacks that leverage such mechanisms to unlock
the model response can be detected by a straightforward perplexity-based
filtering on the input prompt. To overcome this issue, we propose LatentBreak,
a white-box jailbreak attack that generates natural adversarial prompts with
low perplexity capable of evading such defenses. LatentBreak substitutes words
in the input prompt with semantically-equivalent ones, preserving the initial
intent of the prompt, instead of adding high-perplexity adversarial suffixes or
long templates. These words are chosen by minimizing the distance in the latent
space between the representation of the adversarial prompt and that of harmless
requests. Our extensive evaluation shows that LatentBreak leads to shorter and
low-perplexity prompts, thus outperforming competing jailbreak algorithms
against perplexity-based filters on multiple safety-aligned models.

Method: 提出统一模型：检测每个话语在文本、音频和视频中的情感热点；通过热点门控融合将热点与全局特征融合；使用路由混合对齐器进行模态对齐；通过跨模态图编码对话结构。

Result: 在标准ERC基准测试中相比强基线模型取得了持续提升，消融实验证实了热点门控融合和混合对齐器的贡献。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明热点中心视角可以为未来多模态学习提供信息，为ERC中的模态融合提供了新的视角。

Abstract: Emotion Recognition in Conversations (ERC) is hard because discriminative
evidence is sparse, localized, and often asynchronous across modalities. We
center ERC on emotion hotspots and present a unified model that detects
per-utterance hotspots in text, audio, and video, fuses them with global
features via Hotspot-Gated Fusion, and aligns modalities using a routed
Mixture-of-Aligners; a cross-modal graph encodes conversational structure. This
design focuses modeling on salient spans, mitigates misalignment, and preserves
context. Experiments on standard ERC benchmarks show consistent gains over
strong baselines, with ablations confirming the contributions of HGF and MoA.
Our results point to a hotspot-centric view that can inform future multimodal
learning, offering a new perspective on modality fusion in ERC.

TL;DR: MMA-ASIA是一个评估大语言模型在亚洲文化背景下的文化意识框架，包含多语言多模态对齐的基准数据集和五维评估协议，旨在提升模型在非西方环境中的文化可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型在西方高资源环境外的多模态理解和推理能力下降，需要专门评估其在亚洲文化背景下的文化意识。

Method: 构建包含8个亚洲国家、10种语言的27,000道多选题基准数据集，采用五维评估协议（文化意识差异、跨语言一致性、跨模态一致性、文化知识泛化、基础有效性），并开发文化意识基础验证模块和视觉消融前缀重放方法。

Result: 创建了首个在文本、图像和语音三种模态输入层面对齐的数据集，超过79%的问题需要基于文化背景的多步推理。

Conclusion: 该框架为构建文化可靠的多模态大语言模型提供了可操作的见解，通过比较模型分析揭示了模型在不同语言和模态间差异的原因。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are now used worldwide, yet their multimodal
understanding and reasoning often degrade outside Western, high-resource
settings. We propose MMA-ASIA, a comprehensive framework to evaluate LLMs'
cultural awareness with a focus on Asian contexts. MMA-ASIA centers on a
human-curated, multilingual, and multimodally aligned multiple-choice benchmark
covering 8 Asian countries and 10 languages, comprising 27,000 questions; over
79 percent require multi-step reasoning grounded in cultural context, moving
beyond simple memorization. To our knowledge, this is the first dataset aligned
at the input level across three modalities: text, image (visual question
answering), and speech. This enables direct tests of cross-modal transfer.
Building on this benchmark, we propose a five-dimensional evaluation protocol
that measures: (i) cultural-awareness disparities across countries, (ii)
cross-lingual consistency, (iii) cross-modal consistency, (iv) cultural
knowledge generalization, and (v) grounding validity. To ensure rigorous
assessment, a Cultural Awareness Grounding Validation Module detects "shortcut
learning" by checking whether the requisite cultural knowledge supports correct
answers. Finally, through comparative model analysis, attention tracing, and an
innovative Vision-ablated Prefix Replay (VPR) method, we probe why models
diverge across languages and modalities, offering actionable insights for
building culturally reliable multimodal LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大语言模型展现出卓越的推理能力，但其背后的结构机制仍未被充分探索。

Method: 提出GraphGhost统一框架，将神经元激活和信号传播表示为图，使用PageRank等图算法分析LLM特性，并通过结构干预评估关键神经元节点。

Result: 揭示了不同数据集上共享和模型特定的推理行为，显示对关键神经元节点的编辑会引发推理崩溃，改变逻辑流程和语义理解。

Conclusion: GraphGhost是分析、干预和最终理解LLM推理结构基础的有力工具。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable reasoning capabilities,
yet the structural mechanisms underlying these abilities remain under explored.
In this work, we introduce GraphGhost, a unified framework that represents
neuron activations and their signal propagation as graphs, explaining how LLMs
capture structural semantics from sequential inputs and generate outputs
through structurally consistent mechanisms. This graph-based perspective
enables us to employ graph algorithms such as PageRank to characterize the
properties of LLMs, revealing both shared and model-specific reasoning
behaviors across diverse datasets. We further identify the activated neurons
within GraphGhost and evaluate them through structural interventions, showing
that edits to key neuron nodes can trigger reasoning collapse, altering both
logical flow and semantic understanding. Together, these contributions position
GraphGhost as a powerful tool for analyzing, intervening in, and ultimately
understanding the structural foundations of reasoning in LLMs.

TL;DR: 研究发现大型语言模型在医疗诊断中对患者性别相关性的判断存在显著不一致性，特别是在性别相关性判断方面，这可能影响临床实践中LLM的可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在医疗领域的应用日益广泛，但其对性别偏见的敏感性可能影响临床决策的公平性和可靠性。

Method: 使用新英格兰医学杂志挑战赛案例，为多个开源和专有LLM分配性别（女性、男性或未指定），评估其诊断一致性和对患者性别相关性的判断。

Result: 大多数模型的诊断在不同LLM性别下相对一致，但对患者性别相关性和必要性的判断在所有模型中均表现出显著不一致，特别是在相关性判断方面。

Conclusion: LLM在身份分配一致性方面存在未充分探索的偏见，需要在与LLM交互时进行常规检查，以确保可靠和公平的AI支持临床护理。

Abstract: The integration of large language models (LLMs) into healthcare holds promise
to enhance clinical decision-making, yet their susceptibility to biases remains
a critical concern. Gender has long influenced physician behaviors and patient
outcomes, raising concerns that LLMs assuming human-like roles, such as
clinicians or medical educators, may replicate or amplify gender-related
biases. Using case studies from the New England Journal of Medicine Challenge
(NEJM), we assigned genders (female, male, or unspecified) to multiple
open-source and proprietary LLMs. We evaluated their response consistency
across LLM-gender assignments regarding both LLM-based diagnosis and models'
judgments on the clinical relevance or necessity of patient gender. In our
findings, diagnoses were relatively consistent across LLM genders for most
models. However, for patient gender's relevance and necessity in LLM-based
diagnosis, all models demonstrated substantial inconsistency across LLM
genders, particularly for relevance judgements. Some models even displayed a
systematic female-male disparity in their interpretation of patient gender.
These findings present an underexplored bias that could undermine the
reliability of LLMs in clinical practice, underscoring the need for routine
checks of identity-assignment consistency when interacting with LLMs to ensure
reliable and equitable AI-supported clinical care.

TL;DR: 提出了一种利用大语言模型自动生成数学应用题中干扰条件的迭代框架，该框架能保持原问题解不变，大幅减少了人工标注成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数学应用题数据集大多只包含必要信息，而带有干扰条件的问题较少且质量不高，导致大语言模型在遇到干扰条件时性能显著下降，缺乏可靠的评估基准。

Method: 设计了一套提示词，从多个视角和认知层次引导大语言模型修订数学应用题，自动生成有意义的干扰条件，同时确保原问题的解保持不变。

Result: 该框架能够高效生成高质量的带干扰条件的数学应用题，无需重新编写答案，大幅减少了人工工作量。

Conclusion: 提出的迭代框架为生成带干扰条件的数学应用题提供了一种高效且易于部署的解决方案，有助于更可靠地评估大语言模型的数学推理能力。

Abstract: Mathematical reasoning serves as a crucial testbed for evaluating the
intelligence of large language models (LLMs), and math word problems (MWPs)
represent one of the most widely used formats. Most existing MWP datasets
contain only the necessary information, while problems with distracting or
excessive conditions are often overlooked. Prior studies have shown that
popular LLMs experience a dramatic performance drop when such distracting
conditions are introduced. However, available datasets of MWPs with distracting
conditions remain limited, and most exhibit low difficulty and out-of-context
expressions. These shortcomings make the distracting conditions easy to detect
and disregard, thereby reducing the credibility of benchmarking on these
datasets. Moreover, when distracting conditions are added, the reasoning
process and answers may change, requiring intensive manual effort to check and
rewrite solutions.
  To address these issues, we design an iterative framework that leverages LLMs
to generate distracting conditions automatically. We develop a set of prompts
to revise MWPs from multiple perspectives and cognitive levels, encouraging the
creation of meaningful distracting conditions as well as suggestions for
further refinement. A key advantage of our framework is the preservation of
shared solutions between the original and revised problems: the LLMs are
explicitly guided to generate distractions that do not alter the original
solution, thus eliminating the need to produce new answers. This framework is
efficient and easy to deploy, substantially reducing the effort required to
generate MWPs with distracting conditions while maintaining high data quality.

TL;DR: 通过评估模型在基准问题改写版本上的表现，发现LLMs在改写后的准确率显著下降，表明基准分数可能因记忆测试项而虚高。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型的基准分数可能因记忆测试项或近似重复项而虚高，需要验证其泛化能力。

Method: 使用Mistral-7B-Instruct和Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct模型，在ARC-Easy和ARC-Challenge数据集上，通过改写基准问题并比较原始与改写版本的准确率差异。

Result: 改写导致准确率显著下降，证实了模型对表面形式的脆弱依赖和对测试项的记忆问题。

Conclusion: 基准测试存在污染和表面形式捷径的问题，需要更严格的泛化评估方法。

Abstract: Benchmark scores for Large Language Models (LLMs) can be inflated by
memorization of test items or near duplicates. We present a simple, protocol
that probes generalization by re-evaluating models on paraphrased versions of
benchmark questions. Using Mistral-7B-Instruct and Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct, we
measure the accuracy gap between original and paraphrased items on ARC-Easy and
ARC-Challenge. Our pipeline controls decoding, enforces multiple-choice output
format, and includes a robust paraphrase-cleaning step to preserve semantics.
We find that paraphrasing induces a non-trivial accuracy drop (original vs.
paraphrased), consistent with prior concerns about contamination and brittle
surface-form shortcuts.

TL;DR: JAI-1是一个750亿参数的泰语中心语言模型，采用上扩增策略从较小的英语模型扩展参数空间来集成泰语知识，在泰语基准测试中优于Typhoon2-70B。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有泰语模型主要依赖开源模型进行额外训练，但这种方法可能侵蚀模型原有的通用知识。需要一种既能保持通用智能又能有效集成泰语知识的方法。

Method: 从高性能英语开源LLM出发，扩展参数空间，利用新增容量系统集成泰语知识。预训练使用1.5万亿token（含3000亿泰语token），后训练阶段使用60万指令示例进行监督微调和对齐调优。

Result: 在泰语中心基准测试（IFEval-TH、MT-Bench-TH和JAI-Hall-Bench）中表现优于Typhoon2-70B，验证了上扩增和知识集成框架的有效性。

Conclusion: 上扩增策略成功保持了原始模型的通用智能，同时建立了独特的架构，为未来可扩展增强奠定了基础。

Abstract: This technical report introduces JAI-1, a Thai-centric language model with
75B parameters. Recent Thai models have primarily relied on existing
open-source models, applying additional training without structural
modifications to specialize in Thai. However, this approach risks eroding
pre-existing knowledge in the model's parameter space during the injection of
Thai-specific information, as optimized parameters for general tasks may
conflict with new linguistic requirements. In contrast, JAI-1 adopts an
upscaling strategy: starting from a smaller, high-performing English
open-source LLM, we expanded its parameter space and utilized the newly
allocated capacity to systematically integrate Thai-language knowledge. This
methodology not only preserves the original model's general intelligence but
also establishes a unique architecture distinct from other open-source models,
enabling scalable future enhancements. During pre-training, JAI-1 was exposed
to 1.5T tokens, including over 300B Thai language tokens. This was followed by
post-training stages -- supervised fine-tuning and alignment tuning -- using
more than 600K instruction-based examples. The final model demonstrated
superior performance compared to Typhoon2-70B on Thai-centric benchmarks
(IFEval-TH, MT-Bench-TH, and JAI-Hall-Bench), validating the efficacy of its
upscaling and knowledge-integration framework.

Motivation: 随着智能对话模型的快速发展，需要真实的用户模拟研究来调整有效的对话策略，特别是在销售场景中如何根据用户画像优化对话效果。

Method: 引入轻量级的职业条件策略，引导代理优先选择与用户偏好一致的对话意图，基于用户年龄、性别和职业等画像特征进行对话适配。

Result: 该策略产生了更短且更成功的对话，职业因素对对话意图的影响最为显著，而年龄和性别主要影响整体性能。

Conclusion: 研究强调了丰富用户画像模拟的重要性，并证明简单的基于人物特征的策略可以显著提升销售导向对话系统的有效性。

Abstract: Amid the rapid rise of agentic dialogue models, realistic user-simulator
studies are essential for tuning effective conversation strategies. This work
investigates a sales-oriented agent that adapts its dialogue based on user
profiles spanning age, gender, and occupation. While age and gender influence
overall performance, occupation produces the most pronounced differences in
conversational intent. Leveraging this insight, we introduce a lightweight,
occupation-conditioned strategy that guides the agent to prioritize intents
aligned with user preferences, resulting in shorter and more successful
dialogues. Our findings highlight the importance of rich simulator profiles and
demonstrate how simple persona-informed strategies can enhance the
effectiveness of sales-oriented dialogue systems.

TL;DR: 提出了Text2Stories任务和指标，用于量化从访谈记录生成的需求（用户故事）与真实需求的匹配程度，包括正确性和完整性两个维度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然大语言模型可以自动从自然语言输入生成软件需求，但评估这些需求是否真实反映利益相关者需求仍然主要依赖人工任务。

Method: 将访谈记录分割成文本块，将对齐问题建模为文本块与用户故事之间的匹配问题，使用基于LLM的匹配器进行实验。

Result: 在四个数据集上的实验显示，基于LLM的匹配器在保留注释上达到0.86的宏F1分数，而仅使用嵌入模型表现较差但可用于有效阻塞。

Conclusion: Text2Stories指标能够比较不同故事集（如人工生成vs自动生成），作为现有用户故事质量标准的可扩展、忠实于来源的补充。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can be employed for automating the generation of
software requirements from natural language inputs such as the transcripts of
elicitation interviews. However, evaluating whether those derived requirements
faithfully reflect the stakeholders' needs remains a largely manual task. We
introduce Text2Stories, a task and metrics for text-to-story alignment that
allow quantifying the extent to which requirements (in the form of user
stories) match the actual needs expressed by the elicitation session
participants. Given an interview transcript and a set of user stories, our
metric quantifies (i) correctness: the proportion of stories supported by the
transcript, and (ii) completeness: the proportion of transcript supported by at
least one story. We segment the transcript into text chunks and instantiate the
alignment as a matching problem between chunks and stories. Experiments over
four datasets show that an LLM-based matcher achieves 0.86 macro-F1 on held-out
annotations, while embedding models alone remain behind but enable effective
blocking. Finally, we show how our metrics enable the comparison across sets of
stories (e.g., human vs. generated), positioning Text2Stories as a scalable,
source-faithful complement to existing user-story quality criteria.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PARSE系统通过自动优化JSON模式和改进提取方法，显著提升了从非结构化文本中提取结构化信息的准确性和可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法直接将大语言模型应用于使用JSON模式的提取任务，但将JSON模式视为为人类开发者设计的静态契约，导致提取性能不佳、频繁出现幻觉，以及在模式包含模糊或不完整规范时代理行为不可靠。

Method: 开发了PARSE系统，包含两个协同组件：ARCHITECT（自主优化JSON模式以适配LLM消费，同时通过RELAY代码生成系统保持向后兼容性）和SCOPE（实现基于反射的提取，结合静态和LLM基础的防护机制）。

Result: 在三个数据集上的评估显示，PARSE在SWDE数据集上提取准确率提升高达64.7%，跨模型框架改进达到10%，首次重试时减少提取错误92%，同时保持实用延迟。

Conclusion: PARSE通过将JSON模式视为自然语言理解契约并系统优化，显著改善了结构化信息提取的性能和可靠性，为软件3.0系统中的LLM代理提供了更可靠的API交互基础。

Abstract: Structured information extraction from unstructured text is critical for
emerging Software 3.0 systems where LLM agents autonomously interact with APIs
and tools. Recent approaches apply large language models directly to extraction
tasks using existing JSON schemas, often with constraint decoding or
reinforcement learning approaches to ensure syntactic validity, but treat JSON
schemas as static contracts designed for human developers, leading to
suboptimal extraction performance, frequent hallucinations, and unreliable
agent behavior when schemas contain ambiguous or incomplete specifications. We
recognize that JSON schemas themselves are a form of natural language
understanding contract that encodes rules, relationships, and expectations
about data structure contracts that LLMs should be able to both interpret and
systematically improve. Consequently, we develop PARSE (Parameter Automated
Refinement and Schema Extraction), a novel system with two synergistic
components: ARCHITECT, which autonomously optimizes JSON schemas for LLM
consumption while maintaining backward compatibility through RELAY (an
integrated code generation system), and SCOPE, which implements
reflection-based extraction with combined static and LLM-based guardrails. We
evaluate PARSE qualitatively and quantitatively on three datasets including
Schema-Guided Dialogue (SGD), Structured Web Data Extraction (SWDE), and
internal retail conversation data, and find that it achieves up to 64.7%
improvement in extraction accuracy on SWDE with combined framework improvements
reaching 10% across models, while reducing extraction errors by 92% within the
first retry and and maintaining practical latency.

Motivation: 调查评估导向提示是否夸大LLM性能，而实际部署需要简洁、合同约束的答案。

Method: 使用GPT-OSS-20B模型，在六个配对A/B场景中固定任务内容和解码，改变框架（评估导向vs.真实世界）和推理深度，通过确定性验证器计算准确性、合规性等指标。

Result: 评估框架显著增加推理长度，减少仅答案合规性，准确性提升有限或不一致；激励措辞改变错误构成；多语言标题重现这些特征。

Conclusion: 提供可复现的A/B框架和实用指导，确保基准收益反映可部署能力。

Abstract: Benchmarks for large language models (LLMs) often rely on rubric-scented
prompts that request visible reasoning and strict formatting, whereas real
deployments demand terse, contract-bound answers. We investigate whether such
"evaluation scent" inflates measured performance without commensurate
capability gains. Using a single open-weights model (GPT-OSS-20B), we run six
paired A/B scenarios that hold task content and decoding fixed while varying
framing (evaluation-oriented vs. real-world) and reasoning depth (Medium/High):
deterministic math, strict code-fix, citation generation, incentive flips
(caution vs. competence), CoT visibility, and multilingual (Urdu) headers.
Deterministic validators compute accuracy, answer-only compliance,
hedging/refusals, chain-of-thought (CoT) length, and schema compliance, with
pre-registered deltas and composite indices. Across scenarios, evaluation
framing reliably inflates CoT (hundreds to >1000 characters) and reduces
answer-only compliance, with limited or inconsistent accuracy gains. In
structured outputs, it improves wrappers (e.g., fenced blocks, enumerated
lists) but not regex-validated substance. Incentive wording reweights error
composition: praising caution modestly improves accuracy at high reasoning and
reduces wrong-but-confident errors, whereas praising competence yields terser
but riskier outputs. Urdu rubric headers reproduce these signatures and can
decrease accuracy at higher reasoning depth, indicating multilingual parity
risks. We provide a reproducible A/B framework (prompt banks, validators,
per-run scores, scripts; versioned DOI) and practical guidance: neutral
phrasing or dual-framing checks, contract-aware grading, style-delta reporting,
confidence governance, and multilingual dashboards to ensure that benchmark
gains reflect deployable capability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型推理成本高，而小型语言模型的推荐推理能力未被充分探索。现有系统未能充分利用自然语言推理依据作为学习信号。

Method: 提出PULSE框架，将SLM生成的推理依据作为直接学习信号，与交互历史联合监督，创建跨域的用户和物品共同理解空间（Thought Space）。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上优于主流ID、协同过滤和LLM序列推荐模型，在跨域推荐中表现出优越的迁移能力，在推理问答任务中也有强表现。

Conclusion: 将推理依据作为一等信号处理的新颖设计产生了更鲁棒和可泛化的嵌入，证明了SLM在推荐系统中的潜力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have advanced recommendation capabilities
through enhanced reasoning, but pose significant challenges for real-world
deployment due to high inference costs. Conversely, while Small Language Models
(SLMs) offer an efficient alternative, their reasoning capabilities for
recommendation remain underexplored. Existing systems often use natural
language rationales merely as unsupervised descriptive text, failing to harness
their full potential as learning signals. In this work our main idea is to
create a common understanding of user and items across multiple domains called
Thought Space with SLMs instead of using LLMs' distilled knowledge. To that end
we propose PULSE (Preference Understanding by Latent Semantic Embeddings), a
framework that treats SLM-generated rationales as director learning signals,
supervising them with interaction histories to jointly model user actions
(what) and their semantic drivers (why). Existing methods consider only
interactions such as sequences and embeddings, whereas PULSE treats rationales
as first-class signals, this novel design yields embeddings that are more
robust and generalizable. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PULSE
outperforms leading ID, Collaborative Filtering (CF), and LLM-based sequential
recommendation models across multiple benchmark datasets. Furthermore, PULSE
exhibits superior transferability in cross-domain recommendation and
demonstrates strong performance on downstream tasks such as reasoning-oriented
question answering. Our code is available

Motivation: 现有仇恨表情包检测方法多为直接检测，仅提供二元预测，缺乏实际审核所需的上下文和解释。最近的解释-检测方法性能甚至不如简单的SFT基线

Method: 结合SFT预热、带课程学习的GRPO，以及作为推理质量指标和奖励的条件决策熵(CDE)，模仿人类标注者的训练和评估过程

Result: 在三个仇恨表情包基准测试中，ExPO-HM在二元检测、细粒度分类和推理质量方面达到最先进水平，相比GRPO和DPO基线F1分数分别提升15%和17%

Conclusion: ExPO-HM将仇恨表情包检测从简单的二元警报转变为解释驱动的检测，提供准确、可解释且可操作的审核支持

Abstract: Hateful memes have emerged as a particularly challenging form of online
abuse, motivating the development of automated detection systems. Most prior
approaches rely on direct detection, producing only binary predictions. Such
models fail to provide the context and explanations that real-world moderation
requires. Recent Explain-then-Detect approaches, using Chain-of-Thought
prompting or LMM agents, perform worse than simple SFT baselines, and even
advanced post-training methods such as GRPO fail to close the gap. Our analysis
identifies two key issues of such systems: important policy-relevant cues such
as targets and attack types are not hypothesized by the model as a likely
explanation; and the binary reward signal is insufficient to guide reasoning.
To address these challenges, we propose ExPO-HM (Explain-then-Detect Policy
Optimization for Hateful Memes), inspired by the training and evaluation
process of human annotators. ExPO-HM combines SFT warmup, GRPO with curriculum
learning, and Conditional Decision Entropy (CDE) as both metric and reward for
reasoning quality. Across three hateful meme benchmarks, ExPO-HM achieves
state-of-the-art performance on binary detection, fine-grained classification,
and reasoning quality, with up to 15\% and 17\% F1 improvement over the GRPO
and DPO baselines, respectively. By moving hateful meme detection from simple
binary alarms to explanation-driven detection, ExPO-HM provides accurate,
interpretable, and actionable moderation support.

Motivation: 现有语言模型在生成过程中缺乏渐进式的语义细化能力，HDLM旨在通过分层扩散过程实现从粗粒度到细粒度的语义生成。

Method: 使用分层词汇表，低层令牌被映射到高层令牌。正向过程独立扰动每个令牌到其高层祖先，反向过程逐步预测更详细的语义。推导了扩散证据下界的闭式表达式。

Result: 广泛的文本生成实验验证了HDLM的有效性，显示出比基线模型更低的验证困惑度和生成困惑度。

Conclusion: HDLM为语言建模提供了一种通用的时变下一语义尺度预测过程，能够实现更有效的文本生成。

Abstract: In this paper we introduce Hierarchical Diffusion Language Models (HDLM) -- a
novel family of discrete diffusion models for language modeling. HDLM builds on
a hierarchical vocabulary where low-level tokens with detailed semantics are
surjectively mapped to high-level tokens with coarse-grained meanings. In the
forward process, each token is independently perturbed to its higher-level
ancestor with more abstract semantics according to the scheduler, while in the
reverse process the model progressively predicts the next, more detailed
semantics. Taken together, HDLM provides a general time-varying next semantic
scale prediction process for language modeling. We derive closed-form
expressions for the diffusion Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO), and show that HDLM
can be implemented in a flexible manner while including the existing MDLM as a
special case. We also propose practical training techniques based on the
insights. Extensive text generation experiments validate the effectiveness of
HDLM, which demonstrates consistently lower validation and generative
perplexity than baselines.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: UCoT是一种高效推理框架，通过前期思想嵌入实现CoT压缩，使用小模型作为压缩器生成推理信息丰富的前期思想嵌入，大模型作为执行器利用这些嵌入进行短推理，在保持强大推理能力的同时显著减少CoT长度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决长CoT推理方法因自回归生成特性导致的高计算成本和显著延迟损失问题，避免以往方法需要手动设计离散提示或构建压缩CoT数据集而牺牲关键推理细节的缺点。

Method: 提出两阶段合作框架：第一阶段训练小模型（压缩器）生成包含丰富推理信息的前期思想嵌入；第二阶段优化大模型（执行器）利用前期思想嵌入通过奖励机制进行短推理得出正确答案。

Result: 在GSM8K数据集上，UCoT应用于Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct模型时，token使用量减少50%，性能比最先进方法提高3.08%，在保持强大推理能力的同时显著减少CoT长度。

Conclusion: UCoT框架有效解决了CoT推理的效率问题，通过自动化CoT压缩实现了推理效率与性能的平衡，为LLM的高效推理提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Recent developments have enabled advanced reasoning in Large Language Models
(LLMs) via long Chain-of-Thought (CoT), while long CoT suffers from high
computational costs and significant latency losses owing to the autoregressive
nature of generative LLMs. CoT compression aims to improve efficiency in the
reasoning process by reducing output length. Previous works trade reasoning
efficiency by either laborious discrete prompt designing or the construction of
external compressed CoT datasets that sacrifice key reasoning details. In this
work, we propose Upfront CoT (UCoT): an efficient reasoning framework with
upfront thought embedding to automate CoT compression. UCoT is a cooperative
workflow involving a small model (compressor) and a large model (executor). The
first stage of UCoT trains compressor to generate upfront thought embeddings
rich in reasoning information for the executor, avoiding the drawbacks of
manually designed prompts. The second stage optimizes executor to utilize
upfront thought embeddings to derive the correct answer with short reasoning,
using a reward mechanism. Extensive experiments show that UCoT maintains the
powerful reasoning ability of executor while significantly reducing the length
of CoT. It is worth mentioning that when applying UCoT to the
Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct model, the usage of tokens on GSM8K dataset is reduced by
50\%, while the performance is 3.08\% higher than that of the state-of-the-art
(SOTA) method. The code and dataset are in supplementary material.

*Gustave Cortal,Alain Finkel*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一个分析个人叙事风格的形式化框架，通过整合功能语言学、计算机科学和心理学，自动提取语言特征来识别作者在表达主观体验时的语言选择模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 个人叙事中作者通过语言风格来表达主观体验，但缺乏系统分析这些风格选择的正式框架。

Method: 整合功能语言学、计算机科学和心理学，使用语言模型自动提取过程、参与者和环境等语言特征，分析语言选择序列模式。

Result: 在数百个梦境叙事中应用该框架，包括对患有创伤后应激障碍的战争退伍军人的案例研究，发现其叙事中言语过程主导心理过程的独特模式。

Conclusion: 该框架揭示了语言选择与心理状态之间的关系，为系统分析个人叙事风格提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Personal narratives are stories authors construct to make meaning of their
experiences. Style, the distinctive way authors use language to express
themselves, is fundamental to how these narratives convey subjective
experiences. Yet there is a lack of a formal framework for systematically
analyzing these stylistic choices. We present a novel approach that formalizes
style in personal narratives as patterns in the linguistic choices authors make
when communicating subjective experiences. Our framework integrates three
domains: functional linguistics establishes language as a system of meaningful
choices, computer science provides methods for automatically extracting and
analyzing sequential patterns, and these patterns are linked to psychological
observations. Using language models, we automatically extract linguistic
features such as processes, participants, and circumstances. We apply our
framework to hundreds of dream narratives, including a case study on a war
veteran with post-traumatic stress disorder. Analysis of his narratives
uncovers distinctive patterns, particularly how verbal processes dominate over
mental ones, illustrating the relationship between linguistic choices and
psychological states.

TL;DR: 该研究利用LLM技术将定性文本数据与传统评分量表相结合，开发增强型心理测试，在抑郁症评估案例中显著提高了测量精度和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统心理评估主要依赖结构化评分量表，无法充分利用受访者自然语言的丰富信息，需要开发能整合定性数据的新方法。

Method: 提出结合LLM评分文本和传统评分量表项目的增强测试框架，在真实世界样本(n=693)和合成数据集(n=3,000)上进行开发和评估，基于项目信息计算经验性选择最有信息的LLM评分指令。

Result: 在保留测试集上，增强测试在测量精度和准确性方面实现了统计学显著改进，LLM项目的信息增益相当于在原始19项测试中增加了6.3-16.0个项目。

Conclusion: 该方法为利用转录文本增强传统心理测量提供了可扩展途径，在临床健康等领域具有潜在应用价值，代表了绕过传统自动化评分瓶颈的概念性转变。

Abstract: Psychological assessments typically rely on structured rating scales, which
cannot incorporate the rich nuance of a respondent's natural language. This
study leverages recent LLM advances to harness qualitative data within a novel
conceptual framework, combining LLM-scored text and traditional rating-scale
items to create an augmented test. We demonstrate this approach using
depression as a case study, developing and assessing the framework on a
real-world sample of upper secondary students (n=693) and corresponding
synthetic dataset (n=3,000). On held-out test sets, augmented tests achieved
statistically significant improvements in measurement precision and accuracy.
The information gain from the LLM items was equivalent to adding between 6.3
(real data) and 16.0 (synthetic data) items to the original 19-item test. Our
approach marks a conceptual shift in automated scoring that bypasses its
typical bottlenecks: instead of relying on pre-labelled data or complex
expert-created rubrics, we empirically select the most informative LLM scoring
instructions based on calculations of item information. This framework provides
a scalable approach for leveraging the growing stream of transcribed text to
enhance traditional psychometric measures, and we discuss its potential utility
in clinical health and beyond.

TL;DR: dInfer是一个用于扩散式大语言模型(dLLM)的高效推理框架，通过模块化设计和系统优化，在保持输出质量的同时实现显著的速度提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散式大语言模型(dLLM)作为自回归模型的有前景替代方案，虽然具有内在并行性优势，但由于缺乏标准化和高效的推理框架，其广泛应用受到限制。

Method: 将推理流程分解为四个模块化组件：模型、扩散迭代管理器、解码策略和KV缓存管理器，并结合新颖算法和系统级优化。

Result: 在8×H800 GPU上，HumanEval基准测试达到1100+ tokens/秒，六个基准测试平均超过800 tokens/秒；相比Fast-dLLM实现10倍加速，相比优化后的自回归模型QWen2.5-3B仍有2-3倍加速。

Conclusion: dInfer通过算法创新和系统优化，为扩散式大语言模型提供了高效且可扩展的推理解决方案，显著提升了推理效率而不损失模型性能。

Abstract: Diffusion-based large language models (dLLMs) have emerged as a promising
alternative to autoregressive (AR) LLMs, leveraging denoising-based generation
to enable inherent parallelism. Even more and more open-sourced dLLM models
emerge, yet their widespread adoption remains constrained by the lack of a
standardized and efficient inference framework. We present dInfer, an efficient
and extensible framework for dLLM inference. dInfer decomposes the inference
pipeline into four modular components-model, diffusion iteration manager,
decoding strategy, and KV-cache manager-and integrates novel algorithms for
each component alongside system-level optimizations. Through this combination
of algorithmic innovations and system enhancements, dInfer achieves substantial
efficiency gains without compromising output quality on LLaDA-MoE. At batch
size 1, it surpasses 1,100 tokens per second on HumanEval and averages over 800
tokens per second across six benchmarks on $8\times$ H800 GPUs. Compared to
prior systems, dInfer delivers $10\times$ speedup over Fast-dLLM while
maintaining similar model performance. Even compared with AR models (with a
comparable number of activation parameters and performance) QWen2.5-3B, which
is highly optimized with latest vLLM inference engine, dInfer still deliverers
$2$-$3\times$ speedup. The implementation of dInfer is open-sourced at
https://github.com/inclusionAI/dInfer.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文首次对代码领域的大语言模型缩放定律进行了大规模实证研究，发现代码模型相比自然语言需要更高的数据参数比，且在不同计算预算下代码-自然语言混合训练的效果不同。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有缩放定律主要基于自然语言分析，但代码与自然语言在严格语法等方面存在根本差异，因此需要专门研究代码领域的缩放定律。

Method: 进行了117次实验，模型规模从0.2B到3.8B，训练token从2B到128B，拟合了Chinchilla定律和Farsser定律，并进行了代码-自然语言混合实验。

Result: Farsser定律比Chinchilla定律更准确；代码模型能有效随模型规模扩展；代码相比自然语言需要更高的数据参数比；在资源受限时自然语言有益，但在高计算预算时反而有害。

Conclusion: 代码领域需要专门的缩放定律指导，代码模型训练需要更多数据，且代码-自然语言混合策略应根据计算预算灵活调整。

Abstract: Code Large Language Models (LLMs) are revolutionizing software engineering.
However, scaling laws that guide the efficient training are predominantly
analyzed on Natural Language (NL). Given the fundamental differences like
strict syntax between code and NL, it is unclear whether these laws are
directly applicable to code. To address this gap, we conduct the first
large-scale empirical study of scaling laws for code, comprising 117
experimental runs with model sizes from 0.2B to 3.8B and training tokens from
2B to 128B. We fit the Chinchilla law and the Farsser law. First, the results
show that the more expressive Farseer law offers greater accuracy. Second, the
analysis reveals that Code LLMs scale effectively with model size. Crucially,
code represents a more data-hungry regime, requiring a substantially higher
data-to-parameter ratio than NL. Finally, two additional sets of experiments on
code-NL mixtures show that NL benefits resource-constrained scenarios, but
becomes a detriment at higher compute budgets.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个三阶段推理框架来评估LLMs在法律案例推理中的表现，发现模型在表面推理上表现良好，但在层次推理和综合分析上表现显著下降，且错误回答消耗更多计算资源。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 案例推理是美国法律实践的核心，需要专业人士通过类比和区分先例来论证当前案例。虽然LLMs显示出强大能力，但它们在复杂、细致的推理能力仍需进一步研究。

Method: 提出了一个正式框架，将案例区分过程分解为三阶段推理任务：使用事实谓词（因素）建模案例，组织成法律知识层次结构，并定义可验证规则来识别区分、分析论证支持并评估其重要性。

Result: 评估发现模型在表面推理（任务1）上准确率高，但在层次推理（任务2：64.82%-92.09%）和综合分析（任务3：11.46%-33.99%）上性能下降。最显著的是，模型在错误回答上消耗更多计算资源。

Conclusion: 研究为复杂领域中LLM推理能力的细粒度分析提供了方法学，并揭示了构建稳健可信赖法律AI必须解决的基本限制。

Abstract: Case-based reasoning is a cornerstone of U.S. legal practice, requiring
professionals to argue about a current case by drawing analogies to and
distinguishing from past precedents. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have
shown remarkable capabilities, their proficiency in this complex, nuanced form
of reasoning needs further investigation. We propose a formal framework that
decomposes the process of identifying significant distinctions between cases
into three-stage reasoning tasks. Our framework models cases using factual
predicates called factors, organizes them into a legal knowledge hierarchy, and
defines verifiable rules for identifying distinctions, analyzing their
argumentative support, and evaluating their significance. Through comprehensive
evaluation of modern reasoning LLMs, we reveal a paradox: while models achieve
high accuracy on surface-level reasoning (Task 1), performance degrades on
hierarchical reasoning (Task 2: 64.82%-92.09%) and collapses on integrated
analysis (Task 3: 11.46%-33.99%). Most strikingly, we find that models
consistently expend more computational resources on incorrect responses than
correct ones, suggesting that "thinking longer" does not always mean "thinking
smarter." Our work provides a methodology for fine-grained analysis of LLM
reasoning capabilities in complex domains and reveals fundamental limitations
that must be addressed for robust and trustworthy legal AI.

Motivation: 现有基准存在计算成本高、分数膨胀和偏向简单错误而非关键故障的问题，需要更有效的测试用例评估方法。

Method: 将基准构建形式化为在二进制代码-测试矩阵中寻找最优诊断基，提出WrongSelect算法选择最大多样性的错误代码。

Result: 构建的TC-Bench基准显示，即使最先进的测试用例生成方法也只能达到约60%的排除率，暴露了其诊断能力的显著差距。

Conclusion: 该框架能够构建紧凑、多样且抗膨胀的测试基准，有效评估LLM生成的测试用例，揭示了当前方法的局限性。

Abstract: Evaluating test cases automatically generated by Large Language Models (LLMs)
is a critical yet challenging task. Existing benchmarks suffer from high
computational costs, score inflation, and a bias towards trivial bugs over
rare, critical faults. In this work, we ask two fundamental questions: (1) What
is the minimal set of wrong codes sufficient to represent the entire error
space? and (2) What is the minimal set of test cases needed to distinguish
them? We introduce a framework that formalizes benchmark construction as
finding an optimal diagnostic basis in a binary code-test matrix. The rank of
this matrix specifies the minimal number of independent error patterns (wrong
codes) and provides a tight upper bound on the number of test cases required
for complete fault coverage. Our objective is to identify a basis of size equal
to the matrix rank that maximizes internal diversity. To tackle this NP-hard
problem, we propose WrongSelect, an efficient approximation algorithm to select
maximally diverse wrong codes. Applying this framework to millions of
competitive programming submissions, we construct TC-Bench, a compact, diverse,
and inflation-resistant benchmark. Extensive experiments show that even the
most advanced test case generation methods achieve only ~60% exclusion rates on
TC-Bench, exposing a significant gap in their diagnostic power. Our dataset is

TL;DR: 本文研究发现微基准测试在模型排名一致性方面存在局限性，现有方法无法在少量样本下可靠地区分性能相近的模型，需要多达250个样本才能获得一致结果，此时随机抽样与现有方法效果相当。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究微基准测试能否像完整基准测试一样一致地排名语言模型，以及能否比随机选择数据点更一致地排名模型。

Method: 引入了一种微基准测试的元评估方法，研究微基准测试在完整基准测试上根据模型性能差异排名两个模型的能力。

Result: 发现现有微基准测试方法无法在MMLU-Pro上一致排名准确率相差3.5分的模型对，或在BIG-bench Hard上排名相差4分的模型对。需要多达250个样本才能获得一致结果，此时随机抽样与现有方法效果相当。

Conclusion: 为微基准测试用户和开发者提供了在评估效率与可靠性之间权衡的可操作指导，建议需要更多样本才能获得可靠的模型排名结果。

Abstract: Micro-benchmarking offers a solution to the often prohibitive time and cost
of language model development: evaluate on a very small subset of existing
benchmarks. Can these micro-benchmarks, however, rank models as consistently as
the full benchmarks they replace? And can they rank models more consistently
than selecting a random subset of data points? In many scenarios, we find that
the answer is no. We introduce a meta-evaluation measure for micro-benchmarking
which investigates how well a micro-benchmark can rank two models as a function
of their performance difference on the full benchmark. This approach can
determine which model pairs can be ranked correctly by a micro-benchmark,
allowing for a finer-grained analysis of the trade-off between micro-benchmark
size and reliability. Prior work has suggested selecting as few as 10 examples;
we find that no micro-benchmarking method can consistently rank model pairs 3.5
points of accuracy apart on MMLU-Pro or 4 points apart on BIG-bench Hard. In
order to consistently rank model pairs with relatively similar performances, we
show that often as many as 250 examples must be selected, at which point random
sampling is competitive with existing micro-benchmarking methods. When
comparing only 8B instruction-tuned models on MMLU-Pro micro-benchmarks with 25
examples, we find that more than half of pairwise comparisons are not likely to
be preserved. Our work provides actionable guidance for both micro-benchmark
users and developers in navigating the trade-off between evaluation efficiency
and reliability.

Motivation: 地理编码是将位置引用链接到实际地理位置的任务，对非结构化文本的下游分析至关重要。本文探索组合位置引用的地理编码这一具有挑战性的设置。

Method: 基于LLM对地理空间数据的推理能力评估，提出了一种基于LLM的组合位置引用地理编码策略，并对相对较小的LLM进行微调。

Result: 该方法提高了地理编码任务的性能，较小的微调LLM能够达到与大型现成模型相当的性能水平。

Conclusion: LLM在地理编码任务中表现出色，通过适当的策略和微调，较小的模型也能获得与大型模型相媲美的性能，为组合位置引用的地理编码提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Geocoding is the task of linking a location reference to an actual geographic
location and is essential for many downstream analyses of unstructured text. In
this paper, we explore the challenging setting of geocoding compositional
location references. Building on recent work demonstrating LLMs' abilities to
reason over geospatial data, we evaluate LLMs' geospatial knowledge versus
reasoning skills relevant to our task. Based on these insights, we propose an
LLM-based strategy for geocoding compositional location references. We show
that our approach improves performance for the task and that a relatively small
fine-tuned LLM can achieve comparable performance with much larger
off-the-shelf models.

Motivation: 随着LLM在全球多语言环境中的广泛应用，需要理解和保护其多语言响应能力，确保在不同语言和文化背景下的准确性和安全性。

Method: 使用五点评分标准和评判LLM，评估模型在低资源和高资源语言中五个维度的响应表现。

Result: GPT-5在所有类别中平均表现最佳，特别是在同意与自主权、伤害预防与安全类别中得分最高（3.56和4.73），而Gemini 2.5 Pro表现最差（1.39和1.98）。

Conclusion: 需要进一步测试语言变化如何影响LLM在不同类别中的响应，并改进这些领域的表现。

Abstract: With LLM usage becoming widespread across countries, languages, and humanity
more broadly, the need to understand and guardrail their multilingual responses
increases. Large-scale datasets for testing and benchmarking have been created
to evaluate and facilitate LLM responses across multiple dimensions. In this
study, we evaluate the responses of frontier and leading open-source models in
five dimensions across low and high-resource languages to measure LLM accuracy
and consistency across multilingual contexts. We evaluate the responses using a
five-point grading rubric and a judge LLM. Our study shows that GPT-5 performed
the best on average in each category, while other models displayed more
inconsistency across language and category. Most notably, in the Consent &
Autonomy and Harm Prevention & Safety categories, GPT scored the highest with
averages of 3.56 and 4.73, while Gemini 2.5 Pro scored the lowest with averages
of 1.39 and 1.98, respectively. These findings emphasize the need for further
testing on how linguistic shifts impact LLM responses across various categories

TL;DR: 提出Adaptive Retention方法，通过概率性、分层token选择机制，在严格全局预算M下学习保留哪些表示，解决Transformer注意力二次方复杂度问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer注意力机制随序列长度呈二次方增长(O(n^2))，限制了长上下文应用，需要一种高效的token选择方法来减少计算和内存开销。

Method: 使用Bernoulli门通过Hard-Concrete/变分松弛进行训练，在推理时采用简单的top-M规则，使方法可微分且可直接替代标准编码器。

Result: 在分类、抽取式QA和长文档摘要任务中，仅保留30-50%的token就能保持≥95%的完整模型性能，同时峰值内存减少约35-45%，吞吐量提升高达约1.8倍。

Conclusion: 这种架构无关的方法在不修改基础注意力或任务头的情况下，为长上下文处理提供了实用的效率提升。

Abstract: Transformer attention scales quadratically with sequence length O(n^2),
limiting long-context use. We propose Adaptive Retention, a probabilistic,
layer-wise token selection mechanism that learns which representations to keep
under a strict global budget M. Retention is modeled with Bernoulli gates
trained via a Hard-Concrete/variational relaxation and enforced with a simple
top-M rule at inference, making the method differentiable and drop-in for
standard encoders. Across classification, extractive QA, and long-document
summarization, keeping only 30-50% of tokens preserves >= 95% of full-model
performance while cutting peak memory by ~35-45% and improving throughput by up
to ~1.8x. This architecture-agnostic approach delivers practical long-context
efficiency without modifying base attention or task heads.

Motivation: 填补大语言模型在通用中文语境下全面评估的研究空白，特别是评估其整合中文特定事实知识与多步逻辑推理的能力。

Method: 首先从现有QA数据集中构建领域平衡的种子集，然后开发基于LLM的流水线生成基于事实单元链的多跳问题，并采用人机协同验证系统确保数据集质量。

Result: 评估显示现有最先进LLM在处理长尾知识和执行知识密集型推理方面存在持续局限性，但检索增强生成能显著缓解知识差距并带来性能提升。

Conclusion: CCMOR基准揭示了LLM在中文常识推理方面的不足，检索增强是有效的改进方法，为未来研究提供了重要评估工具。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated advanced reasoning
capabilities, their comprehensive evaluation in general Chinese-language
contexts remains understudied. To bridge this gap, we propose Chinese
Commonsense Multi-hop Reasoning (CCMOR), a novel benchmark designed to evaluate
LLMs' ability to integrate Chinese-specific factual knowledge with multi-step
logical reasoning. Specifically, we first construct a domain-balanced seed set
from existing QA datasets, then develop an LLM-powered pipeline to generate
multi-hop questions anchored on factual unit chains. To ensure the quality of
resulting dataset, we implement a human-in-the-loop verification system, where
domain experts systematically validate and refine the generated questions.
Using CCMOR, we evaluate state-of-the-art LLMs, demonstrating persistent
limitations in LLMs' ability to process long-tail knowledge and execute
knowledge-intensive reasoning. Notably, retrieval-augmented generation
substantially mitigates these knowledge gaps, yielding significant performance
gains.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 科学工作流需要严谨、与领域知识紧密结合的算法，且需要解决一系列子问题才能得到最终结果，而现有方法在这方面存在不足。

Method: 采用无训练框架，设计专门智能体在学生-教师范式中进行自我反思、创建推理、编码和调试，结合整合上下文窗口(CCW)来缓解LLM幻觉。

Result: 在科学编码基准测试中，MOSAIC在准确性、鲁棒性和可解释性方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MOSAIC框架通过多智能体协作和专门设计，有效解决了科学代码生成中的挑战，特别是在复杂科学任务中表现出色。

Abstract: We present MOSAIC, a multi-agent Large Language Model (LLM) framework for
solving challenging scientific coding tasks. Unlike general-purpose coding,
scientific workflows require algorithms that are rigorous, interconnected with
deep domain knowledge, and incorporate domain-specific reasoning, as well as
algorithm iteration without requiring I/O test cases. Many scientific problems
also require a sequence of subproblems to be solved, leading to the final
desired result. MOSAIC is designed as a training-free framework with specially
designed agents to self-reflect, create the rationale, code, and debug within a
student-teacher paradigm to address the challenges of scientific code
generation. This design facilitates stepwise problem decomposition, targeted
error correction, and, when combined with our Consolidated Context Window
(CCW), mitigates LLM hallucinations when solving complex scientific tasks
involving chained subproblems. We evaluate MOSAIC on scientific coding
benchmarks and demonstrate that our specialized agentic framework outperforms
existing approaches in terms of accuracy, robustness, and interpretability.

Conclusion: 首次提供定量证据表明语言在隐私泄露中起重要作用，强调在LLM部署中需要语言感知的隐私保护机制。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed across multilingual
applications that handle sensitive data, yet their scale and linguistic
variability introduce major privacy risks. Mostly evaluated for English, this
paper investigates how language structure affects privacy leakage in LLMs
trained on English, Spanish, French, and Italian medical corpora. We quantify
six linguistic indicators and evaluate three attack vectors: extraction,
counterfactual memorization, and membership inference. Results show that
privacy vulnerability scales with linguistic redundancy and tokenization
granularity: Italian exhibits the strongest leakage, while English shows higher
membership separability. In contrast, French and Spanish display greater
resilience due to higher morphological complexity. Overall, our findings
provide the first quantitative evidence that language matters in privacy
leakage, underscoring the need for language-aware privacy-preserving mechanisms
in LLM deployments.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了Search-on-Graph (SoG)框架，让LLM在知识图谱上进行迭代式图导航，解决多跳知识问答问题，在多个基准测试中达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在知识密集型多跳问题上不可靠，会遗漏长尾事实、产生幻觉且知识更新滞后。现有KGQA方法面临查询编译困难、子图检索噪声大、复杂代理框架搜索空间爆炸等问题。

Method: SoG采用"观察-导航"原则，让LLM在每一步检查当前实体的可用关系后再决定下一跳，使用单一Search函数进行迭代图导航，自适应处理不同图谱模式和高度数节点。

Result: 在六个KGQA基准测试中达到最先进性能，无需微调。在Wikidata基准上比之前最佳方法提升16%，在Freebase基准上也有一致改进。

Conclusion: SoG框架简单有效，通过迭代式图导航解决了LLM在知识图谱问答中的关键限制，展示了在复杂知识推理任务中的强大能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive reasoning abilities
yet remain unreliable on knowledge-intensive, multi-hop questions -- they miss
long-tail facts, hallucinate when uncertain, and their internal knowledge lags
behind real-world change. Knowledge graphs (KGs) offer a structured source of
relational evidence, but existing KGQA methods face fundamental trade-offs:
compiling complete SPARQL queries without knowing available relations proves
brittle, retrieving large subgraphs introduces noise, and complex agent
frameworks with parallel exploration exponentially expand search spaces. To
address these limitations, we propose Search-on-Graph (SoG), a simple yet
effective framework that enables LLMs to perform iterative informed graph
navigation using a single, carefully designed \textsc{Search} function. Rather
than pre-planning paths or retrieving large subgraphs, SoG follows an
``observe-then-navigate'' principle: at each step, the LLM examines actual
available relations from the current entity before deciding on the next hop.
This approach further adapts seamlessly to different KG schemas and handles
high-degree nodes through adaptive filtering. Across six KGQA benchmarks
spanning Freebase and Wikidata, SoG achieves state-of-the-art performance
without fine-tuning. We demonstrate particularly strong gains on Wikidata
benchmarks (+16\% improvement over previous best methods) alongside consistent
improvements on Freebase benchmarks.

TL;DR: 提出了PE-CoA框架，通过五种对话模式构建有效的多轮越狱攻击，在12个LLM和10个危害类别上实现最先进性能，揭示了模式特定的漏洞和LLM行为特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多轮越狱方法依赖启发式探索策略，对模型底层弱点理解有限，且对话模式与跨危害类别漏洞之间的关系仍不清楚。

Method: 提出PE-CoA框架，包含五种对话模式，通过自然对话构建多轮越狱攻击。

Result: 在12个LLM和10个危害类别上实现最先进性能，发现模型对特定对话模式存在弱点，且模型家族共享相似的失败模式。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了安全训练的局限性，表明需要模式感知的防御措施。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) remain vulnerable to multi-turn jailbreaking
attacks that exploit conversational context to bypass safety constraints
gradually. These attacks target different harm categories (like malware
generation, harassment, or fraud) through distinct conversational approaches
(educational discussions, personal experiences, hypothetical scenarios).
Existing multi-turn jailbreaking methods often rely on heuristic or ad hoc
exploration strategies, providing limited insight into underlying model
weaknesses. The relationship between conversation patterns and model
vulnerabilities across harm categories remains poorly understood. We propose
Pattern Enhanced Chain of Attack (PE-CoA), a framework of five conversation
patterns to construct effective multi-turn jailbreaks through natural dialogue.
Evaluating PE-CoA on twelve LLMs spanning ten harm categories, we achieve
state-of-the-art performance, uncovering pattern-specific vulnerabilities and
LLM behavioral characteristics: models exhibit distinct weakness profiles where
robustness to one conversational pattern does not generalize to others, and
model families share similar failure modes. These findings highlight
limitations of safety training and indicate the need for pattern-aware
defenses. Code available on: https://github.com/Ragib-Amin-Nihal/PE-CoA

TL;DR: 本文评估了质量估计重排序在文档级机器翻译中的应用，发现使用最佳学习指标SLIDE和LLM指标GEMBA-DA能显著提升翻译质量，特别是在32个候选翻译的情况下。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 质量估计重排序在句子级翻译中已被证明有效，但在日益重要的文档级翻译领域应用不足，需要探索其在该领域的性能表现。

Method: 使用各种学习型和大型语言模型的质量估计指标，在文档级翻译中进行质量估计重排序，评估不同候选翻译数量下的性能提升。

Result: 使用最佳学习指标SLIDE时，BLEURT-20得分在2个候选翻译时提升+2.00，32个候选时提升+5.09；使用最佳LLM指标GEMBA-DA时，分别提升+1.63和+4.30。

Conclusion: 文档级质量估计重排序具有实际应用价值，在合适的翻译模型和硬件条件下，能以最小的运行时开销显著提升翻译质量。

Abstract: Quality estimation (QE) reranking is a form of quality-aware decoding which
aims to improve machine translation (MT) by scoring and selecting the best
candidate from a pool of generated translations. While known to be effective at
the sentence level, its application to the increasingly prominent domain of
document-level translation remains underexplored. In this work, we evaluate QE
reranking performance on document-level (rather than the typical
sentence-level) translation, using various learned and large language model
(LLM)-based QE metrics. We find that with our best learned metric, SLIDE,
BLEURT-20 scores improve by +2.00 with only two candidates, and by +5.09 with
32, across both decoder-only LLM models and encoder-decoder neural machine
translation (NMT) models. Using the best LLM-based metric, GEMBA-DA, gains of
+1.63 and +4.30 are achieved under the same conditions. Although gains shrink
with longer inputs, reranking with 32 candidates yields improvements of +2.34
(SLIDE) and +1.40 (GEMBA-DA) on our longest documents (512-1024 source tokens).
These findings demonstrate the practical value of document-level QE, with
minimal runtime overhead given suitable translation models and hardware.

Motivation: 现有方法通常通过限制更新来间接鼓励探索，但未在token生成阶段明确促进探索行为。研究发现LLM中的token在推理任务中扮演不同角色，分为高熵推理token和低熵知识token。

Method: 在采样过程中为不同token类型应用不同的温度设置：对推理token使用更高温度以主动鼓励探索，对知识token使用较低温度以维持事实正确性。系统研究了多种多温度调度策略及其在强化学习环境中的影响。

Result: 在多个推理基准测试上的实证评估表明，该方法显著提升了LLM的推理性能。

Conclusion: 通过为不同token类型应用差异化温度设置来明确促进探索的方法，能够有效提升LLM的推理能力，同时保持事实准确性。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning has demonstrated substantial improvements in the
reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), exhibiting significant
applicability across various domains. Recent research has identified that
tokens within LLMs play distinct roles during reasoning tasks, categorizing
them into high-entropy reasoning tokens and low-entropy knowledge tokens. Prior
approaches have typically focused on restricting updates to indirectly
encourage exploration, yet they do not explicitly facilitate exploratory
behavior during the token generation stage itself. In this work, we introduce a
complementary approach that explicitly promotes exploration during sampling by
applying distinct temperature settings for different token types. Specifically,
our method employs higher temperatures for reasoning tokens to actively
encourage exploration, while retaining lower temperatures for knowledge tokens
to maintain factual correctness. Furthermore, we systematically investigate
various multi-temperature scheduling strategies and their impacts within
reinforcement learning contexts. Empirical evaluations on several reasoning
benchmarks demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances the reasoning
performance of LLMs. The code is available at

Abstract: Accurate recognition of biomedical named entities is critical for medical
information extraction and knowledge discovery. However, existing methods often
struggle with nested entities, entity boundary ambiguity, and cross-lingual
generalization. In this paper, we propose a unified Biomedical Named Entity
Recognition (BioNER) framework based on Large Language Models (LLMs). We first
reformulate BioNER as a text generation task and design a symbolic tagging
strategy to jointly handle both flat and nested entities with explicit boundary
annotation. To enhance multilingual and multi-task generalization, we perform
bilingual joint fine-tuning across multiple Chinese and English datasets.
Additionally, we introduce a contrastive learning-based entity selector that
filters incorrect or spurious predictions by leveraging boundary-sensitive
positive and negative samples. Experimental results on four benchmark datasets
and two unseen corpora show that our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance and robust zero-shot generalization across languages. The source
codes are freely available at https://github.com/dreamer-tx/LLMNER.

TL;DR: 提出语义锚压缩(SAC)方法，通过直接选择锚点token并聚合上下文信息到其KV表示中，避免自编码训练，提升上下文压缩性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有上下文压缩方法依赖自编码任务训练，但重建优化与下游任务存在不匹配，削弱了实际使用中有用的特征。

Method: SAC直接选择锚点token，通过锚点嵌入和双向注意力修改，让锚点token捕获整个上下文信息，无需自编码训练。

Result: SAC在各种压缩比下均优于现有方法，在MRQA上的5倍压缩比自编码方法提升1 EM，压缩比越高优势越明显。

Conclusion: SAC通过直接利用上下文token表示，避免了自编码训练的不匹配问题，实现了更有效的上下文压缩。

Abstract: Context compression presents a promising approach for accelerating large
language model (LLM) inference by compressing long contexts into compact
representations. Current context compression methods predominantly rely on
autoencoding tasks to train context-agnostic compression tokens to compress
contextual semantics. While autoencoding tasks enable compression tokens to
acquire compression capabilities, compression via autoencoding tasks creates a
fundamental mismatch: the models are optimized for reconstruction that diverge
from actual downstream tasks, thereby weakening the features more beneficial
for real-world usage. We propose Semantic-Anchor Compression (SAC), a novel
method that shifts from autoencoding task based compression to an architecture
that is equipped with this compression capability \textit{a priori}. Instead of
training models to compress contexts through autoencoding tasks, SAC directly
selects so-called anchor tokens from the original context and aggregates
contextual information into their key-value (KV) representations. By deriving
representations directly from the contextual tokens, SAC eliminates the need
for autoencoding training. To ensure compression performance while directly
leveraging anchor tokens, SAC incorporates two key designs: (1) anchor
embeddings that enable the compressor to identify critical tokens, and (2)
bidirectional attention modification that allows anchor tokens to capture
information from the entire context. Experimental results demonstrate that SAC
consistently outperforms existing context compression methods across various
compression ratios. On out-of-distribution evaluation using MRQA, SAC achieves
1 EM improvement at 5x compression over strong baselines, with increasing
advantages at higher compression ratios.

Motivation: 研究LLM内部表示中是否存在类似人类印象和刻板印象的模式，以及这些人工印象如何影响模型行为。

Method: 使用线性探针在生成的提示上预测基于SCM的二维印象，分析隐藏表示中印象的可解码性及其与模型响应的关系。

Result: 发现LLM在提示时报告印象不一致，但从隐藏表示中线性解码印象更一致；人工印象能预测模型响应的质量和对冲使用；特定内容、风格和方言特征会影响LLM印象。

Conclusion: LLM内部存在可解码的人工印象模式，这些印象影响模型行为，提示特征对印象形成有重要影响。

Abstract: We introduce and study artificial impressions--patterns in LLMs' internal
representations of prompts that resemble human impressions and stereotypes
based on language. We fit linear probes on generated prompts to predict
impressions according to the two-dimensional Stereotype Content Model (SCM).
Using these probes, we study the relationship between impressions and
downstream model behavior as well as prompt features that may inform such
impressions. We find that LLMs inconsistently report impressions when prompted,
but also that impressions are more consistently linearly decodable from their
hidden representations. Additionally, we show that artificial impressions of
prompts are predictive of the quality and use of hedging in model responses. We
also investigate how particular content, stylistic, and dialectal features in
prompts impact LLM impressions.

TL;DR: 提出了SOP-Maze基准，用于评估大语言模型在复杂标准操作程序场景下的能力，包含397个任务和23个SOP场景，揭示了模型在流程遵循、对话处理和计算推理方面的关键挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准主要评估LLMs的指令遵循和决策能力，但在涉及复杂标准操作程序的业务场景中的评估尚未充分探索，需要专门基准来填补这一空白。

Method: 基于真实业务数据构建SOP-Maze基准，将SOP任务分为横向根系统（宽选项任务）和核心根系统（深度逻辑推理任务），并对多个最先进模型进行广泛实验。

Result: 几乎所有最先进模型在SOP-Maze上都表现不佳，识别出三个关键错误类别：路径盲点、对话脆弱性和计算错误。

Conclusion: 该研究为改进模型在需要广度和深度的SOP任务中的能力提供了新见解，相关代码已开源。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are widely deployed as domain-specific
agents, many benchmarks have been proposed to evaluate their ability to follow
instructions and make decisions in real-world scenarios. However, business
scenarios often involve complex standard operating procedures (SOPs), and the
evaluation of LLM capabilities in such contexts has not been fully explored. To
bridge this gap, we propose SOP-Maze, a benchmark constructed from real-world
business data and adapted into a collection of 397 tasks from 23 complex SOP
scenarios. We further categorize SOP tasks into two broad classes: Lateral Root
System (LRS), representing wide-option tasks that demand precise selection; and
Heart Root System (HRS), which emphasizes deep logical reasoning with complex
branches. Extensive experiments reveal that nearly all state-of-the-art models
struggle with SOP-Maze. We conduct a comprehensive analysis and identify three
key error categories: (i) route blindness: difficulty following procedures;
(ii) conversational fragility: inability to handle real dialogue nuances; and
(iii) calculation errors: mistakes in time or arithmetic reasoning under
complex contexts. The systematic study explores LLM performance across SOP
tasks that challenge both breadth and depth, offering new insights for
improving model capabilities. We have open-sourced our work on

Abstract: We study how open source communities describe participation and control
through version controlled governance documents. Using a corpus of 710 projects
with paired snapshots, we parse text into actors, rules, actions, and objects,
then group them and measure change with entropy for evenness, richness for
diversity, and Jensen Shannon divergence for drift. Projects define more roles
and more actions over time, and these are distributed more evenly, while the
composition of rules remains stable. These findings indicate that governance
grows by expanding and balancing categories of participation without major
shifts in prescriptive force. The analysis provides a reproducible baseline for
evaluating whether future AI mediated workflows concentrate or redistribute
authority.

Motivation: 现有GRPO方法及其变体依赖静态或过于简化的权重方案，无法适应模型能力的变化，导致训练在不同难度级别上不均衡，限制了整体性能。

Method: DARO方法根据模型学习状态动态调整每个难度组的损失贡献，解决损失尺度问题。

Result: 在Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B、Qwen2.5-Math-7B和Llama3.1-8B模型上的实验表明，DARO在六个数学基准测试中优于四个领先基线方法，收敛速度更快且最终性能更优。

Conclusion: DARO通过动态难度感知的重新加权策略优化，有效解决了现有RLVR方法的局限性，显著提升了模型的推理能力和训练效率。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have shown that reasoning
ability can be significantly enhanced through Reinforcement Learning with
Verifiable Rewards (RLVR). Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has
emerged as the de facto approach for RLVR, inspiring numerous variants.
However, our mathematical analysis reveals that these methods are fundamentally
weighted variations of GRPO. We provide a unified view, demonstrating that
their reliance on static or overly simplistic weighting schemes tied to sample
difficulty prevents adaptation to a model's evolving capabilities. This creates
a significant loss scale issue, where training disproportionately focuses on
certain difficulty levels at the expense of others, hindering overall
performance. To address these limitations, we introduce
\textbf{Difficulty-Aware Reweighting Policy Optimization (DARO)}, a method that
dynamically adjusts the loss contribution of each difficulty group based on the
model's learning state. Extensive experiments on Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B,
Qwen2.5-Math-7B, and Llama3.1-8B show that DARO outperforms four leading
baselines across six math benchmarks, achieving significantly faster
convergence and superior final performance.

TL;DR: LoRA-based Refusal-training enables performance-preserving safety alignment using only safety data, serving as cost-efficient safety patches


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current safety alignment methods require expensive searches for optimal data proportions to balance safety and general performance, with high costs and limited gains

Method: LoRA-based Refusal-training that trains solely on safety data, leveraging LoRA's ability to decouple safety into low-rank subspace orthogonal to model's intrinsic transformation space

Result: LoRA effectively decouples safety into low-rank subspace largely orthogonal to model's intrinsic transformation space, ensuring safety enhancements do not interfere with inherent capabilities

Conclusion: LoRA serves as cost-efficient, performance-preserving, and plug-and-play safety patches for AI model safety alignment

Abstract: Safety alignment is essential for building trustworthy artificial
intelligence, yet it remains challenging to enhance model safety without
degrading general performance. Current approaches require computationally
expensive searches for the optimal proportion of safety-critical and
general-purpose data to balance safety and general performance, incurring high
costs with limited gains. In this work, we show that LoRA-based
Refusal-training enables performance-preserving safety alignment even when
trained solely on safety data, demonstrating that LoRA serves as
cost-efficient, performance-preserving, and plug-and-play safety patches.
Beyond empirical findings, we provide both theoretical and experimental
evidence that LoRA effectively decouples safety into a low-rank subspace
largely orthogonal to the model's intrinsic transformation space, ensuring that
safety enhancements do not interfere with inherent capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于大型语言模型的Text-to-SQL方法依赖专有模型，存在部署可行性和数据隐私问题，需要开发轻量级解决方案。

Method: 包含两个组件：使用向量数据库进行高效模式链接的模式检索器，以及经过监督微调和执行引导强化学习两阶段微调的SQL生成器。

Result: 在BIRD数据集上达到72.10%的执行准确率，在Spider 1.0上达到88.45%，参数量减少2-30倍但性能相当或更优。

Conclusion: 高质量Text-to-SQL生成可以使用轻量模型实现，为隐私敏感和资源受限场景提供实用解决方案。

Abstract: The Text-to-SQL task translates natural language questions into SQL queries,
enabling intuitive database interaction for non-experts. While recent methods
leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve strong performance, their
reliance on proprietary models raise concerns about deployment feasibility and
data privacy. In this work, we introduce LitE-SQL, a Lightweight and Efficient
framework with two components: (i) a Schema Retriever that performs efficient
schema linking using a vector database of pre-computed schema embeddings, and
(ii) a SQL Generator fine-tuned in two stages-supervised fine-tuning followed
by execution-guided reinforcement-enabling self-correction without costly
multi-candidate generation. On BIRD, LitE-SQL achieves 72.10% execution
accuracy, and on Spider 1.0 it reaches 88.45%, demonstrating comparable or
superior performance to LLM-based methods despite using 2x to 30x fewer
parameters. Our findings demonstrate that high-quality Text-to-SQL generation
is feasible with lightweight models, offering a practical solution for

TL;DR: 通过迭代优化评分标准来提升LLM在自动作文评分中的表现，该方法通过让模型反思自身评分理由与人类评分的差异来改进评分标准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型的性能对提示词高度敏感，受提示优化领域启发，本研究探索通过优化LLM使用的评分标准来提升自动作文评分的准确性。

Method: 让模型通过反思自身评分理由和与人类评分在样本作文上的差异，迭代优化评分标准。

Result: 在TOEFL11和ASAP数据集上使用GPT-4.1、Gemini-2.5-Pro和Qwen-3-Next-80B-A3B-Instruct模型，QWK分别提升了0.19和0.47。即使使用简单的初始评分标准，也能达到或超过使用详细人工编写评分标准的效果。

Conclusion: 迭代评分标准优化在基于LLM的自动作文评分中对于提升与人类评估的一致性至关重要。

Abstract: The performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) is highly sensitive to the
prompts they are given. Drawing inspiration from the field of prompt
optimization, this study investigates the potential for enhancing Automated
Essay Scoring (AES) by refining the scoring rubrics used by LLMs. Specifically,
our approach prompts models to iteratively refine rubrics by reflecting on
models' own scoring rationales and observed discrepancies with human scores on
sample essays. Experiments on the TOEFL11 and ASAP datasets using GPT-4.1,
Gemini-2.5-Pro, and Qwen-3-Next-80B-A3B-Instruct show Quadratic Weighted Kappa
(QWK) improvements of up to 0.19 and 0.47, respectively. Notably, even with a
simple initial rubric, our approach achieves comparable or better QWK than
using detailed human-authored rubrics. Our findings highlight the importance of
iterative rubric refinement in LLM-based AES to enhance alignment with human
evaluations.

TL;DR: 该研究针对资源匮乏的查克马语，构建了孟加拉语转写的查克马语语料库，并通过微调多语言Transformer模型，在掩码语言建模任务上取得了显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 查克马语作为一种印欧语系语言，可用数据有限，在语言模型中代表性不足，需要开发有效的资源和方法来支持这种低资源语言的处理。

Method: 从查克马文学中收集语料，经母语者验证后构建孟加拉语转写的查克马语数据集，然后对6种编码器型多语言Transformer模型进行掩码语言建模任务的微调。

Result: 微调后的多语言模型在孟加拉语转写的查克马语上表现优于预训练模型，最高达到73.54%的词元准确率和低至2.90的困惑度。

Conclusion: 孟加拉语转写的查克马语对查克马语的迁移学习非常有效，研究还揭示了数据质量对模型性能的影响以及OCR管道在形态丰富的印度文字中的局限性。

Abstract: As an Indo-Aryan language with limited available data, Chakma remains largely
underrepresented in language models. In this work, we introduce a novel corpus
of contextually coherent Bangla-transliterated Chakma, curated from Chakma
literature, and validated by native speakers. Using this dataset, we fine-tune
six encoder-based multilingual and regional transformer models (mBERT,
XLM-RoBERTa, DistilBERT, DeBERTaV3, BanglaBERT, and IndicBERT) on masked
language modeling (MLM) tasks. Our experiments show that fine-tuned
multilingual models outperform their pre-trained counterparts when adapted to
Bangla-transliterated Chakma, achieving up to 73.54% token accuracy and a
perplexity as low as 2.90. Our analysis further highlights the impact of data
quality on model performance and shows the limitations of OCR pipelines for
morphologically rich Indic scripts. Our research demonstrates that
Bangla-transliterated Chakma can be very effective for transfer learning for
Chakma language, and we release our manually validated monolingual dataset to
encourage further research on multilingual language modeling for low-resource
languages.

*Chi Seng Cheang,Hou Pong Chan,Wenxuan Zhang,Yang Deng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLM内部状态无法可靠区分事实与幻觉，因为基于主体知识的幻觉与正确回答使用相同的内部召回过程，导致隐藏状态几何重叠且不可区分；而脱离主体知识的幻觉则产生可检测的聚类表示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLM内部计算是否能可靠区分事实性输出与幻觉输出，因为LLM可能在内部编码事实性信号，但也会因依赖捷径或虚假关联而产生事实错误。

Method: 通过机制分析比较两种类型的幻觉：基于主体知识的幻觉和脱离主体知识的幻觉，分析LLM内部处理事实查询的过程。

Result: 当幻觉与主体知识相关时，LLM使用与正确回答相同的内部召回过程，导致隐藏状态几何重叠且不可区分；而脱离主体知识的幻觉产生独特的聚类表示，使其可检测。

Conclusion: LLM并未在其内部状态中编码真实性，而仅编码知识召回模式，表明"LLM实际上并不知道它们不知道什么"。

Abstract: Recent work suggests that large language models (LLMs) encode factuality
signals in their internal representations, such as hidden states, attention
weights, or token probabilities, implying that LLMs may "know what they don't
know". However, LLMs can also produce factual errors by relying on shortcuts or
spurious associations. These error are driven by the same training objective
that encourage correct predictions, raising the question of whether internal
computations can reliably distinguish between factual and hallucinated outputs.
In this work, we conduct a mechanistic analysis of how LLMs internally process
factual queries by comparing two types of hallucinations based on their
reliance on subject information. We find that when hallucinations are
associated with subject knowledge, LLMs employ the same internal recall process
as for correct responses, leading to overlapping and indistinguishable
hidden-state geometries. In contrast, hallucinations detached from subject
knowledge produce distinct, clustered representations that make them
detectable. These findings reveal a fundamental limitation: LLMs do not encode
truthfulness in their internal states but only patterns of knowledge recall,
demonstrating that "LLMs don't really know what they don't know".

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了Alif-1.0-8B-Instruct，一个乌尔都语-英语多语言模型，通过改进的自指导技术创建高质量合成数据集，在低预算下显著提升了乌尔都语任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决低资源语言（如乌尔都语）开发大型语言模型面临的挑战，包括高质量数据集稀缺、多语言不一致性和安全问题。现有方法通过翻译大量数据但缺乏质量和文化细微差别。

Method: 使用改进的自指导技术创建高质量多语言合成数据集（Urdu-Instruct），包含乌尔都语本地思维链推理、双语翻译、文化相关性和伦理安全对齐。基于预训练的Llama-3.1-8B构建模型。

Result: Alif-1.0-8B-Instruct在乌尔都语特定任务上优于Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct，并超越了包括Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3、Qwen-2.5-7B-Instruct和Cohere-Aya-Expanse-8B在内的领先多语言LLM，训练预算低于100美元。

Conclusion: 通过改进的自指导方法可以高效开发高性能、低资源语言LLM，并实现文化对齐。所有数据集、模型和代码已公开。

Abstract: Developing a high-performing large language models (LLMs) for low-resource
languages such as Urdu, present several challenges. These challenges include
the scarcity of high-quality datasets, multilingual inconsistencies, and safety
concerns. Existing multilingual LLMs often address these issues by translating
large volumes of available data. However, such translations often lack quality
and cultural nuance while also incurring significant costs for data curation
and training. To address these issues, we propose Alif-1.0-8B-Instruct, a
multilingual Urdu-English model, that tackles these challenges with a unique
approach. We train the model on a high-quality, multilingual synthetic dataset
(Urdu-Instruct), developed using a modified self-instruct technique. By using
unique prompts and seed values for each task along with a global task pool,
this dataset incorporates Urdu-native chain-of-thought based reasoning,
bilingual translation, cultural relevance, and ethical safety alignments. This
technique significantly enhances the comprehension of Alif-1.0-8B-Instruct
model for Urdu-specific tasks. As a result, Alif-1.0-8B-Instruct, built upon
the pretrained Llama-3.1-8B, demonstrates superior performance compared to
Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct for Urdu specific-tasks. It also outperformed leading
multilingual LLMs, including Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3, Qwen-2.5-7B-Instruct,
and Cohere-Aya-Expanse-8B, all within a training budget of under $100. Our
results demonstrate that high-performance and low-resource language LLMs can be
developed efficiently and culturally aligned using our modified self-instruct
approach. All datasets, models, and code are publicly available at:

*Chung-En Sun,Ge Yan,Akshay Kulkarni,Tsui-Wei Weng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ReFIne训练框架通过监督微调和GRPO优化推理模型的可信度，包括可解释性、忠实性和可靠性，在数学基准测试中显著提升这些指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有长链思维推理研究过于关注准确性和效率，忽视了可信度这一关键维度。可信的推理系统需要具备可解释性、忠实性和可靠性。

Method: 提出ReFIne训练框架，结合监督微调和GRPO，使模型生成结构化标签追踪、披露决策信息、提供自我评估，提升三个可信度维度。

Result: 在Qwen3模型上应用ReFIne，可解释性提升44.0%，忠实性提升18.8%，可靠性提升42.4%，同时生成更清晰的结构化推理轨迹。

Conclusion: 推理模型不仅应优化准确性，还应关注可信度的多个维度，ReFIne框架为此提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning have largely
prioritized answer accuracy and token efficiency, while overlooking aspects
critical to trustworthiness. We argue that usable reasoning systems must be
trustworthy, characterized by three properties: interpretability, faithfulness,
and reliability. To this end, we propose ReFIne, a new training framework that
integrates supervised fine-tuning with GRPO to encourage models to: (i) improve
interpretability by producing structured, tag-based traces with high-level
planning that are easier for humans to follow; (ii) enhance faithfulness by
explicitly disclosing the decisive information guiding each solution, with
consistent cross-section references; and (iii) promote reliability by providing
self-assessments of both the derivation's soundness and the confidence of the
final answer. We apply ReFIne to the Qwen3 models at multiple scales
(1.7B/4B/8B) and evaluate across mathematical benchmarks of varying difficulty.
Our experimental results show that ReFIne models generate clearer and
better-structured reasoning traces (interpretability +44.0%), more faithfully
expose their underlying decision process (faithfulness +18.8%), and offer
informative confidence estimates (reliability +42.4%). These findings highlight
an overlooked but important direction: reasoning models should be optimized not
only for accuracy, but also for broader dimensions of trustworthiness. Our code

*Chihiro Yano,Kosuke Yamada,Hayato Tsukagoshi,Ryohei Sasano,Koichi Takeda*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于因果语言模型（CLM）的语义框架归纳新方法FrameEOL，通过提示工程获取框架嵌入，结合上下文学习和深度度量学习提升性能，在英语和日语FrameNet数据集上超越现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然因果语言模型（如GPT、Llama系列）在各种语言理解任务中表现出色，但尚未应用于语义框架归纳任务。现有方法主要依赖掩码语言模型，而CLM在对话中表现出对框架的理解能力，因此探索其在框架归纳中的应用。

Method: 提出FrameEOL方法：1）使用提示工程获取输出单一框架名称的框架嵌入；2）结合上下文学习（ICL）和深度度量学习（DML）优化嵌入质量；3）通过聚类生成的嵌入进行框架归纳。

Result: 在英语和日语FrameNet数据集上的实验表明，该方法优于现有框架归纳方法。特别是对于缺乏丰富框架资源的日语，仅使用5个ICL示例的CLM方法就达到了与使用DML微调的MLM方法相当的性能。

Conclusion: CLM在语义框架归纳任务中具有显著潜力，FrameEOL方法为框架资源稀缺的语言提供了有效的解决方案，证明了提示工程和上下文学习在框架归纳中的有效性。

Abstract: Semantic frame induction is the task of clustering frame-evoking words
according to the semantic frames they evoke. In recent years, leveraging
embeddings of frame-evoking words that are obtained using masked language
models (MLMs) such as BERT has led to high-performance semantic frame
induction. Although causal language models (CLMs) such as the GPT and Llama
series succeed in a wide range of language comprehension tasks and can engage
in dialogue as if they understood frames, they have not yet been applied to
semantic frame induction. We propose a new method for semantic frame induction
based on CLMs. Specifically, we introduce FrameEOL, a prompt-based method for
obtaining Frame Embeddings that outputs One frame-name as a Label representing
the given situation. To obtain embeddings more suitable for frame induction, we
leverage in-context learning (ICL) and deep metric learning (DML). Frame
induction is then performed by clustering the resulting embeddings.
Experimental results on the English and Japanese FrameNet datasets demonstrate
that the proposed methods outperform existing frame induction methods. In
particular, for Japanese, which lacks extensive frame resources, the CLM-based
method using only 5 ICL examples achieved comparable performance to the
MLM-based method fine-tuned with DML.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型(LLM)在静态语料上训练，难以处理快速演变的信息或领域特定查询，RAG通过结合外部检索机制来解决这一限制。

Method: 通过综述分析RAG的总体目标、核心组件、关键挑战和局限性，展示RAG与LLM结合的应用场景。

Result: 识别了RAG的关键弱点，展示了在LLM单独表现不佳但RAG能显著提升效果的特定应用场景。

Conclusion: 鼓励研究者重新思考RAG的角色，并启发下一代RAG系统的开发。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled a wide range of applications
through their powerful capabilities in language understanding and generation.
However, as LLMs are trained on static corpora, they face difficulties in
addressing rapidly evolving information or domain-specific queries.
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) was developed to overcome this limitation
by integrating LLMs with external retrieval mechanisms, allowing them to access
up-to-date and contextually relevant knowledge. However, as LLMs themselves
continue to advance in scale and capability, the relative advantages of
traditional RAG frameworks have become less pronounced and necessary. Here, we
present a comprehensive review of RAG, beginning with its overarching
objectives and core components. We then analyze the key challenges within RAG,
highlighting critical weakness that may limit its effectiveness. Finally, we
showcase applications where LLMs alone perform inadequately, but where RAG,
when combined with LLMs, can substantially enhance their effectiveness. We hope
this work will encourage researchers to reconsider the role of RAG and inspire
the development of next-generation RAG systems.

TL;DR: 提出了DITING评估框架，专门针对网络小说翻译，包含6个维度的评估指标，并开发了AgentEval多智能体评估框架和MetricAlign元评估数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有机器翻译评估基准主要依赖表层指标，无法有效评估网络小说翻译的特有特征，如叙事和文化保真度。

Method: 构建了包含18K专家标注中英句对的DITING评估框架，提出基于推理的多智能体评估方法AgentEval，并开发了MetricAlign元评估数据集。

Result: 评估了14个开放、闭源和商业模型，发现中文训练的LLM优于更大的国外模型，DeepSeek-V3在忠实度和风格一致性方面表现最佳。

Conclusion: 为LLM驱动的网络小说翻译建立了新的评估范式，提供了公开资源推动未来研究。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have substantially advanced machine translation
(MT), yet their effectiveness in translating web novels remains unclear.
Existing benchmarks rely on surface-level metrics that fail to capture the
distinctive traits of this genre. To address these gaps, we introduce DITING,
the first comprehensive evaluation framework for web novel translation,
assessing narrative and cultural fidelity across six dimensions: idiom
translation, lexical ambiguity, terminology localization, tense consistency,
zero-pronoun resolution, and cultural safety, supported by over 18K
expert-annotated Chinese-English sentence pairs. We further propose AgentEval,
a reasoning-driven multi-agent evaluation framework that simulates expert
deliberation to assess translation quality beyond lexical overlap, achieving
the highest correlation with human judgments among seven tested automatic
metrics. To enable metric comparison, we develop MetricAlign, a meta-evaluation
dataset of 300 sentence pairs annotated with error labels and scalar quality
scores. Comprehensive evaluation of fourteen open, closed, and commercial
models reveals that Chinese-trained LLMs surpass larger foreign counterparts,
and that DeepSeek-V3 delivers the most faithful and stylistically coherent
translations. Our work establishes a new paradigm for exploring LLM-based web
novel translation and provides public resources to advance future research.

TL;DR: 通过添加思考式话语（TAU）来增强对话数据，以在文本聊天中建模个体个性。TAU是说话者在表达前对想法的语言化。使用TAU增强数据训练的人格LLM能更好地模仿说话者的大五人格特质，特别是在宜人性和神经质方面。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对话模型难以准确捕捉个体人格特质，希望通过思考式话语（TAU）来增强对话数据，使LLM能更好地模拟说话者的个性特征。

Method: 提出使用TAU增强对话数据的方法，TAU是说话者在表达前对想法的语言化。使用这种增强数据训练人格LLM，并基于大五人格框架评估模型性能。

Result: 使用TAU增强数据训练的LLM在宜人性和神经质两个维度上更接近说话者的真实人格特质，且TAU增强质量影响人格LLM的表现。

Conclusion: TAU增强能有效提升LLM在人格建模方面的性能，特别是在宜人性和神经质维度，但增强质量是关键影响因素。

Abstract: This study proposes augmenting dialog data with think-aloud utterances (TAUs)
for modeling individual personalities in text chat by LLM. TAU is a
verbalization of a speaker's thought before articulating the utterance. We
expect "persona LLMs" trained with TAU-augmented data can mimic the speaker's
personality trait better. We tested whether the trained persona LLMs obtain the
human personality with respect to Big Five, a framework characterizing human
personality traits from five aspects. The results showed that LLMs trained with
TAU-augmented data more closely align to the speakers' Agreeableness and
Neuroticism of Big Five than those trained with original dialog data. We also
found that the quality of TAU-augmentation impacts persona LLM's performance.

TL;DR: 本文提出了两种增强文本去标识化攻击的策略：多排序聚合预测和使用推理模型，以提高重新识别被屏蔽个人身份信息的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本去标识化方法难以评估其保护个人身份信息的效果，需要通过重新识别攻击来测试其鲁棒性。

Method: 1. 研究PII跨度重新识别顺序的重要性，通过聚合多个排序的预测来改进结果；2. 使用推理模型，特别是在攻击者拥有广泛背景知识的情况下提升重新识别性能。

Result: 两种策略都能显著提高重新识别攻击的效果，特别是在攻击者拥有丰富背景知识时推理模型表现更佳。

Conclusion: 通过多排序聚合和推理模型可以构建更强的重新识别攻击，这有助于更准确地评估文本去标识化方法的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Text de-identification techniques are often used to mask personally
identifiable information (PII) from documents. Their ability to conceal the
identity of the individuals mentioned in a text is, however, hard to measure.
Recent work has shown how the robustness of de-identification methods could be
assessed by attempting the reverse process of _re-identification_, based on an
automated adversary using its background knowledge to uncover the PIIs that
have been masked. This paper presents two complementary strategies to build
stronger re-identification attacks. We first show that (1) the _order_ in which
the PII spans are re-identified matters, and that aggregating predictions
across multiple orderings leads to improved results. We also find that (2)
reasoning models can boost the re-identification performance, especially when
the adversary is assumed to have access to extensive background knowledge.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的翻译增强方法，通过指令模型和层选择性调优，在保持推理能力的同时显著提升多语言翻译性能，特别是在低资源语言上。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通用大语言模型擅长推理但翻译能力不足，翻译增强的模型又缺乏推理能力。需要一种方法能同时保持强大的推理能力和提升翻译性能。

Method: 从指令模型开始，仅使用平行数据应用层选择性调优，构建Qwen3-XPlus模型。

Result: 在高低资源语言翻译上都取得显著提升，低资源语言达到15+ spBLEU和40+ xComet；在7个多语言任务上平均提升1+分，同时在15个推理数据集上保持与Qwen3指令模型相当的能力。

Conclusion: 该方法为多语言增强提供了有前景的途径，显著降低了复杂性并提高了更多语言的可访问性。

Abstract: General Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in reasoning, but those enhanced
for translation struggle with reasoning tasks. To address this, we propose a
novel translationenhanced recipe that begins with instruct models and applies
layer-selective tuning only on parallel data. Following this pipeline, we
introduce the Qwen3-XPlus models, which demonstrate significant improvements in
translation performance across both high- and lowresource languages, achieving
15+ spBLEU and 40+ xComet in low-resource languages, like Swahili.
Interestingly, training only with small parallel datasets, Qwen3-XPlus achieves
an average improvement of 1+ points on 7 multilingual tasks while maintaining
proficiency comparable to the Qwen3 instruct model in 15 popular reasoning
datasets. This work offers a promising approach to multilingual enhancement,
significantly reducing complexity and enhancing accessibility for a wider range
of languages. The code and model are publicly available.

TL;DR: DICE是一个轻量级框架，通过小语言模型对LLM输出进行思维链修正，解决LLM在推理任务中忽视格式要求的问题，显著提升格式准确性和内容正确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在执行推理任务时往往优先考虑推理过程而忽视用户特定的格式要求，但直接微调LLM成本高昂且参数访问受限。

Method: 采用两阶段方法构建结构化思维链适应数据集，然后通过双重调优策略微调SLM，以分析-回答模式生成结构化输出。

Result: 实验表明DICE将LLM输出的平均格式准确性和内容正确性分别提升了35.4%和29.4%，达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: DICE框架在保留LLM广泛知识和推理能力的同时，确保输出符合用户需求，提供了一种高效解决格式遵从问题的方法。

Abstract: When performing reasoning tasks with user-specific requirements, such as
strict output formats, large language models (LLMs) often prioritize reasoning
over adherence to detailed instructions. Fine-tuning LLMs on supervised
datasets to address this is impractical due to high computational costs and
limited parameter access. To tackle this, we propose DICE, a lightweight
framework that guides small language models (SLMs) to refine LLMs' outputs
through chain-of-thought (CoT) correction. DICE decouples the process by first
prompting LLMs to generate natural language responses, then using trained SLMs
to analyze and refine these outputs to meet structured output specifications.
This framework preserves LLMs' broad knowledge and reasoning capabilities while
ensuring the outputs conform to user demands. Specifically, DICE first
constructs structured CoT adaptation datasets via a two-stage method and
subsequently applies a dual-tuning strategy to fine-tune SLMs for generating
structured outputs in an analyze-then-answer pattern. Experiments demonstrate
that DICE improves the average format accuracy and content correctness of LLM
outputs by 35.4\% and 29.4\%, respectively, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA)
performance over other competitive baselines.

TL;DR: IRIS是一个实时因果发现框架，通过结合统计算法和LLM方法，从初始变量自动发现已知和新的因果关系，并能识别缺失变量来扩展因果图。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统因果发现方法面临数据收集成本高、已知关系重复计算、假设不现实等挑战，而现有LLM方法只能发现已知关系而无法发现新关系。

Method: IRIS框架从初始变量开始，自动收集相关文档、提取变量、发现因果关系，采用统计算法和LLM混合方法，并包含缺失变量提议组件来扩展因果图。

Result: 该方法实现了仅从初始变量集进行实时因果发现，无需预存数据集，能够发现已知和新的因果关系。

Conclusion: IRIS框架解决了传统因果发现方法的局限性，通过混合方法和缺失变量识别，实现了更全面和实用的因果发现。

Abstract: Causal discovery is fundamental to scientific research, yet traditional
statistical algorithms face significant challenges, including expensive data
collection, redundant computation for known relations, and unrealistic
assumptions. While recent LLM-based methods excel at identifying commonly known
causal relations, they fail to uncover novel relations. We introduce IRIS
(Iterative Retrieval and Integrated System for Real-Time Causal Discovery), a
novel framework that addresses these limitations. Starting with a set of
initial variables, IRIS automatically collects relevant documents, extracts
variables, and uncovers causal relations. Our hybrid causal discovery method
combines statistical algorithms and LLM-based methods to discover known and
novel causal relations. In addition to causal discovery on initial variables,
the missing variable proposal component of IRIS identifies and incorporates
missing variables to expand the causal graphs. Our approach enables real-time
causal discovery from only a set of initial variables without requiring
pre-existing datasets.

TL;DR: 本文提出了CrisiText，这是第一个针对13种危机场景生成警告消息的大规模数据集，包含超过40万条警告消息，旨在帮助平民在危机期间和之后获得及时指导。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在自然灾害或暴力袭击等危机情况下，有效识别威胁并减轻潜在损害至关重要。虽然AI已被用于协助人类应对紧急情况，但NLP技术的应用仍然有限，主要集中在分类任务上，而使用NLG架构生成及时警告消息的潜力在很大程度上被忽视了。

Method: 从现有的危机描述出发，创建与场景相关的事件链，每个事件都与警告消息配对。生成过程遵循专家编写的指南，确保术语正确性和建议的事实性。此外，每条消息都附带三种次优警告类型，以研究不同的NLG方法。进行了一系列实验，比较监督微调设置与偏好对齐、零样本和少样本方法。

Result: 构建了包含超过40万条警告消息（涵盖近18,000个危机情况）的数据集，覆盖13种不同类型的危机场景。实验评估了不同NLG方法的性能，包括在分布外场景下的表现以及自动后编辑器的有效性。

Conclusion: CrisiText数据集填补了危机情况下警告消息生成的空白，为研究不同NLG方法提供了基础，并展示了在紧急情况下生成及时、准确警告消息的可行性。

Abstract: Effectively identifying threats and mitigating their potential damage during
crisis situations, such as natural disasters or violent attacks, is paramount
for safeguarding endangered individuals. To tackle these challenges, AI has
been used in assisting humans in emergency situations. Still, the use of NLP
techniques remains limited and mostly focuses on classification tasks. The
significant potential of timely warning message generation using NLG
architectures, however, has been largely overlooked. In this paper we present
CrisiText, the first large-scale dataset for the generation of warning messages
across 13 different types of crisis scenarios. The dataset contains more than
400,000 warning messages (spanning almost 18,000 crisis situations) aimed at
assisting civilians during and after such events. To generate the dataset, we
started from existing crisis descriptions and created chains of events related
to the scenarios. Each event was then paired with a warning message. The
generations follow experts' written guidelines to ensure correct terminology
and factuality of their suggestions. Additionally, each message is accompanied
by three suboptimal warning types to allow for the study of different NLG
approaches. To this end, we conducted a series of experiments comparing
supervised fine-tuning setups with preference alignment, zero-shot, and
few-shot approaches. We further assessed model performance in
out-of-distribution scenarios and evaluated the effectiveness of an automatic
post-editor.

*Chenyang Gu,Yewen Pu,Bruce Yang,Xiaofan Li,Huan Gao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出DSPO算法，通过序列级优化和动态样本过滤增强LLM的外部知识搜索能力，无需监督数据，在多个QA基准上显著优于之前工作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法要么依赖提示激发模型内在代理能力，要么在复杂交互任务中应用RL时存在性能上限和崩溃问题，未能充分发挥其代理潜力。

Method: 提出DSPO算法，包含序列级策略优化和动态样本过滤，通过纯RL训练实现多轮搜索和推理的交错，无需监督演示数据。

Result: 在多个QA基准上，DSPO训练的7B模型比之前可比工作提升34.1%，在复杂多跳QA如HotpotQA上甚至超过之前14B模型近9%相对性能，保持优异训练稳定性。

Conclusion: DSPO算法能有效增强LLM的外部知识搜索能力，在复杂任务中表现出色，且训练稳定。

Abstract: Enhancing LLMs with the ability to actively search external knowledge is
crucial for complex and real-world tasks. Current approaches either rely on
prompting to elicit the model's innate agent capabilities, or suffer from
performance ceilings and collapse when applying RL to complex interactive
tasks, leaving their true agentic potential untapped. To address this, we
introduce \textbf{D}ynamic-filter \textbf{S}equence-level \textbf{P}olicy
\textbf{O}ptimization (DSPO), an improved RL algorithm designed for robust
agent training through sequence-level optimization and dynamic sample
filtering. We train our model purely through RL to interleave multi-turn search
and reasoning, obviating the need for supervised demonstration data. Across
multiple QA benchmarks, our DSPO-trained 7B model improves over a comparable
previous work by \textbf{34.1\%}, and even outperforms the 14B model from
previous work in complex multihop QA such as HotpotQA by nearly \textbf{9\%
relative}, maintaining exceptional training stability.

*Yongding Tao,Tian Wang,Yihong Dong,Huanyu Liu,Kechi Zhang,Xiaolong Hu,Ge Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了首个针对RL后训练阶段数据污染检测的方法Self-Critique，通过检测模型输出熵分布崩溃来识别污染样本，在RL-MIA基准上显著优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RL后训练阶段缺乏专门的数据污染检测方法，而该阶段对LLM推理能力提升日益重要，现有检测方法在此场景下接近随机猜测。

Method: Self-Critique方法基于RL后训练导致模型输出熵分布崩溃为稀疏模式的观察，通过探测底层策略崩溃来检测污染。

Result: 在多个模型和污染任务上，Self-Critique显著优于基线方法，AUC提升高达30%，使RL阶段污染检测成为可能。

Conclusion: 该研究填补了RL后训练阶段数据污染检测的空白，提出的Self-Critique方法有效解决了这一关键漏洞。

Abstract: Data contamination poses a significant threat to the reliable evaluation of
Large Language Models (LLMs). This issue arises when benchmark samples may
inadvertently appear in training sets, compromising the validity of reported
performance. While detection methods have been developed for the pre-training
and Supervised Fine-Tuning stages, a critical research gap exists for the
increasingly significant phase of Reinforcement Learning (RL) post-training. As
RL post-training becomes pivotal for advancing LLM reasoning, the absence of
specialized contamination detection methods in this paradigm presents a
critical vulnerability. To address this, we conduct the first systematic study
of data detection within RL post-training scenario and propose Self-Critique.
Our method is motivated by a key observation: after RL phase, the output
entropy distribution of LLMs tends to collapse into highly specific and sparse
modes. Self-Critique probes for the underlying policy collapse, i.e., the
model's convergence to a narrow reasoning path, which causes this entropy
reduction. To facilitate this research, we also introduce RL-MIA, a benchmark
constructed to simulate this specific contamination scenario. Extensive
experiments show that Self-Critique significantly outperforms baseline methods
across multiple models and contamination tasks, achieving an AUC improvement of
up to 30%. Whereas existing methods are close to a random guess for RL-phase
contamination, our method makes detection possible.

TL;DR: 提出了CFVBench基准测试，用于评估多模态检索增强生成模型在视频理解中的表现，发现现有模型在捕捉细粒度多模态细节方面存在瓶颈，并提出了自适应视觉优化框架来改进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频MRAG基准测试在模态覆盖和格式多样性方面存在局限，往往关注单模态或有限模态任务，或粗粒度的场景理解，需要更全面的评估框架。

Method: 构建了CFVBench基准测试，包含599个公开视频和5,360个开放问答对，涵盖图表密集报告、新闻广播和软件教程等高密度格式和领域。提出了自适应视觉优化框架，通过自适应增加帧采样密度和选择性调用外部工具来改进细粒度多模态理解。

Result: 系统评估了7种检索方法和14个常用MLLM，发现当前模型（包括GPT5和Gemini）在捕捉瞬态但关键的细粒度多模态细节方面存在困难。AVR框架能持续增强细粒度多模态理解能力，提升所有评估MLLM的性能。

Conclusion: 当前多模态大语言模型在细粒度多模态细节理解方面存在显著瓶颈，提出的自适应视觉优化框架是解决这一问题的简单有效方法，能显著提升模型性能。

Abstract: Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (MRAG) enables Multimodal Large
Language Models (MLLMs) to generate responses with external multimodal
evidence, and numerous video-based MRAG benchmarks have been proposed to
evaluate model capabilities across retrieval and generation stages. However,
existing benchmarks remain limited in modality coverage and format diversity,
often focusing on single- or limited-modality tasks, or coarse-grained scene
understanding. To address these gaps, we introduce CFVBench, a large-scale,
manually verified benchmark constructed from 599 publicly available videos,
yielding 5,360 open-ended QA pairs. CFVBench spans high-density formats and
domains such as chart-heavy reports, news broadcasts, and software tutorials,
requiring models to retrieve and reason over long temporal video spans while
maintaining fine-grained multimodal information. Using CFVBench, we
systematically evaluate 7 retrieval methods and 14 widely-used MLLMs, revealing
a critical bottleneck: current models (even GPT5 or Gemini) struggle to capture
transient yet essential fine-grained multimodal details. To mitigate this, we
propose Adaptive Visual Refinement (AVR), a simple yet effective framework that
adaptively increases frame sampling density and selectively invokes external
tools when necessary. Experiments show that AVR consistently enhances
fine-grained multimodal comprehension and improves performance across all
evaluated MLLMs

TL;DR: DyReMe是一个动态医疗诊断基准，通过生成类似真实咨询的病例来评估大语言模型，比静态基准更能反映临床实践需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于静态医学考试题目的LLM评估与真实临床实践脱节，高估模型性能且忽略了真实世界的模糊性和多样性。

Method: 提出DyReMe动态基准，生成新鲜咨询病例，引入鉴别诊断和常见误诊因素等干扰项，并变化表达风格模拟真实查询习惯。

Result: 实验表明动态方法提供更具挑战性和真实性的评估，揭示了最先进LLM与实际临床实践之间的显著不匹配。

Conclusion: 迫切需要能更好反映可信医疗诊断需求的评估框架，DyReMe为此提供了更现实的评估方法。

Abstract: Medical diagnostics is a high-stakes and complex domain that is critical to
patient care. However, current evaluations of large language models (LLMs) are
fundamentally misaligned with real-world clinical practice. Most of them rely
on static benchmarks derived from public medical exam items, which tend to
overestimate model performance and ignore the difference between textbook cases
and the ambiguous, varying conditions in the real world. Recent efforts toward
dynamic evaluation offer a promising alternative, but their improvements are
limited to superficial perturbations and a narrow focus on accuracy. To address
these gaps, we propose DyReMe, a dynamic benchmark for medical diagnostics that
better reflects real clinical practice. Unlike static exam-style questions,
DyReMe generates fresh, consultation-like cases that introduce distractors such
as differential diagnoses and common misdiagnosis factors. It also varies
expression styles to mimic diverse real-world query habits. Beyond accuracy,
DyReMe evaluates LLMs on three additional clinically relevant dimensions:
veracity, helpfulness, and consistency. Our experiments demonstrate that this
dynamic approach yields more challenging and realistic assessments, revealing
significant misalignments between the performance of state-of-the-art LLMs and
real clinical practice. These findings highlight the urgent need for evaluation
frameworks that better reflect the demands of trustworthy medical diagnostics.

TL;DR: CLARity是一个成本效益高的强化学习框架，使用小型通用LLM增强推理质量，通过一致性感知奖励机制和两阶段训练流程，在数据稀缺领域提高专家LLM的推理一致性和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在数据稀缺领域训练专家LLM很困难，通常依赖多选题。但标准的基于结果的强化学习可能提高准确性，却常常降低推理质量如逻辑一致性。现有监督推理的解决方案如大规模过程奖励模型成本过高。

Method: CLARity框架整合了一致性感知奖励机制与两阶段精炼-监控训练流程，以及动态数据重构策略来更好地利用有限数据。使用小型通用LLM来指导专家模型。

Result: 实验显示CLARity相比基线提高了16.5%的响应一致性和7.5%的准确性。人工评估进一步确认了连贯性和专业性的整体改进。

Conclusion: CLARity提供了一个通用解决方案，使较小模型能够通过推理一致性有效指导专家模型。

Abstract: Training expert LLMs in domains with scarce data is difficult, often relying
on multiple-choice questions (MCQs). However, standard outcome-based
reinforcement learning (RL) on MCQs is risky. While it may improve accuracy, we
observe it often degrades reasoning quality such as logical consistency.
Existing solutions to supervise reasoning, such as large-scale Process Reward
Models (PRMs), are prohibitively expensive. To address this, we propose
CLARity, a cost-effective RL framework that enhances reasoning quality using
only a small, general-purpose LLM. CLARity integrates a consistency-aware
reward mechanism with a 2-stage refine-then-monitor training pipeline to
enhance reasoning consistency, and a dynamic data reformulation strategy to to
better exploit limited data. Experiments demonstrate that CLARity improves
response consistency by 16.5% and accuracy by 7.5% over baselines. Human
evaluations further confirm holistic improvements in coherence and
professionalism. Thus, CLARity offers a generalizable solution that enables
smaller models to effectively guide expert models by reasoning consistency.Our

TL;DR: 提出DualCSE方法，为每个句子分配两个嵌入向量：一个表示显式语义，一个表示隐式语义，以克服传统单向量方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统句子嵌入方法仅分配单个向量，难以捕捉句子中的隐式语义，存在固有局限性。

Method: DualCSE为每个句子分配两个嵌入向量：显式语义嵌入和隐式语义嵌入，在共享空间中并存，可根据特定任务需求选择相应语义。

Result: 实验结果表明DualCSE能有效编码显式和隐式含义，并提升下游任务性能。

Conclusion: DualCSE通过双向量表示方法成功克服了传统句子嵌入的局限性，在信息检索和文本分类等任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Sentence embedding methods have made remarkable progress, yet they still
struggle to capture the implicit semantics within sentences. This can be
attributed to the inherent limitations of conventional sentence embedding
methods that assign only a single vector per sentence. To overcome this
limitation, we propose DualCSE, a sentence embedding method that assigns two
embeddings to each sentence: one representing the explicit semantics and the
other representing the implicit semantics. These embeddings coexist in the
shared space, enabling the selection of the desired semantics for specific
purposes such as information retrieval and text classification. Experimental
results demonstrate that DualCSE can effectively encode both explicit and
implicit meanings and improve the performance of the downstream task.

TL;DR: 提出MaP框架，通过检查点合并和Pass@k指标来减少LLM预训练评估中的不稳定性，提供更可靠的训练动态观察。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM预训练评估存在显著不稳定性，这掩盖了真实的学习动态，阻碍了模型进展。

Method: MaP框架结合检查点合并（平滑参数空间）和Pass@k指标（提供低方差统计估计），对抗参数不稳定性和评估不稳定性。

Result: 实验表明MaP产生更平滑的性能曲线，减少运行间方差，确保更一致的模型排名。

Conclusion: MaP为LLM研究提供了更可靠和真实的训练动态观察视角，奠定了重要的实证基础。

Abstract: Reliable evaluation is fundamental to the progress of Large Language Models
(LLMs), yet the evaluation process during pre-training is plagued by
significant instability that obscures true learning dynamics. In this work, we
systematically diagnose this instability, attributing it to two distinct
sources: \textit{Parameter Instability} from training stochasticity and
\textit{Evaluation Instability} from noisy measurement protocols. To counteract
both sources of noise, we introduce \textbf{MaP}, a dual-pronged framework that
synergistically integrates checkpoint \underline{M}erging \underline{a}nd the
\underline{P}ass@k metric. Checkpoint merging smooths the parameter space by
averaging recent model weights, while Pass@k provides a robust, low-variance
statistical estimate of model capability. Extensive experiments show that MaP
yields significantly smoother performance curves, reduces inter-run variance,
and ensures more consistent model rankings. Ultimately, MaP provides a more
reliable and faithful lens for observing LLM training dynamics, laying a
crucial empirical foundation for LLM research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 法院观点生成是法律人工智能中的基础任务，但由于案件事实的多样性和复杂性，直接从原始事实生成法院观点可能限制性能。

Method: 构建了包含11万多个案件的中文法院观点生成数据集CCVG，每个案件包含事实描述和对应的法院观点。基于此数据集训练专门的大语言模型ShiZhi。

Result: ShiZhi在法院观点生成任务上达到58.5 BLEU-1，在罪名预测任务上达到86.1%准确率和92.5%宏F1值。

Conclusion: 实验结果表明，即使是一个小型大语言模型，在高质量领域特定数据上训练后，也能生成合理且法律连贯的法院观点。

Abstract: Criminal Court View Generation (CVG) is a fundamental task in legal
artificial intelligence, aiming to automatically generate the "Court View"
section of a legal case document. Generating court views is challenging due to
the diversity and complexity of case facts, and directly generating from raw
facts may limit performance. In this paper, we present ShiZhi, the first large
language model (LLM) specifically designed for court view generation. We
construct a Chinese Court View Generation dataset, CCVG, of more than 110K
cases, each containing fact descriptions paired with corresponding court views.
Based on this dataset, ShiZhi achieving 58.5 BLEU-1 on court view generation
and 86.1\% accuracy with 92.5\% macro F1 on charge prediction. Experimental
results demonstrate that even a small LLM can generate reasonable and legally
coherent court views when trained on high-quality domain-specific data. Our

TL;DR: MaskKV是一个针对扩散大语言模型的训练无关缓存淘汰框架，通过掩码查询引导的评分机制和自适应缓存预算策略，在仅保留5%令牌的情况下保持94%性能，实现31倍加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散大语言模型的双向注意力缓存机制需要大量内存，限制了在资源受限环境下处理长上下文的能力。现有缓存淘汰策略为自回归模型设计，忽略了扩散模型的独特特性。

Method: 1) 掩码查询引导的评分机制：利用注意力权重识别和淘汰每个注意力头中不太重要的提示令牌；2) 自适应缓存预算策略：减少中间层分配，将资源集中在偏好提示的注意力头上。

Result: 在LLaDA模型上，仅压缩到256对KV缓存（少于5%令牌）即可在LongBench上保持94%的全缓存性能，在32k提示长度下实现高达31倍的加速。

Conclusion: MaskKV有效解决了扩散大语言模型的缓存内存问题，显著提升了长上下文处理效率，同时保持高性能。

Abstract: Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) present a promising alternative to
dominant autoregressive models (ARMs) by the ability of parallel decoding at
the expense of substantial computation and memory costs. Specifically, the
cache mechanism for bidirectional attention in dLLMs demands large memory
footprint, restricting their ability to handle long contexts under
resource-limited settings. Existing cache eviction strategies are designed for
ARMs and ignore the unique characteristics of dLLMs, thus leading to
unsatisfactory performance. To address these challenges, we introduce MaskKV, a
training-free cache eviction framework tailored to dLLMs, focusing on the
effect of mask tokens in dLLMs. MaskKV is built on two key innovations: (1) a
mask-query guided scoring mechanism that leverages attention weights to
identify and evict less critical prompt tokens for each head; (2) an adaptive
cache budgeting strategy that improves efficiency by reducing allocation in
intermediate layers and concentrating resources on prompt-preferring heads. On
LLaDA with MaskKV, compressing the KV cache to only 256 pairs (less than 5% of
tokens) retains 94% of the full-cache performance on LongBench and achieves up
to 31x acceleration at 32k prompt length. The code is publicly available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的CoT验证方法（黑盒或灰盒）只能预测推理正确性，但无法解释计算失败的原因，需要一种能深入理解推理过程的方法。

Method: 使用基于电路推理验证的白盒方法，训练分类器分析正确和错误CoT步骤归因图的结构特征指纹。

Result: 该方法能有效预测推理错误，发现错误特征具有高度领域特异性，并能通过针对性干预成功纠正模型的错误推理。

Conclusion: 通过审查模型的计算过程，可以从简单的错误检测转向对LLM推理的更深层次因果理解。

Abstract: Current Chain-of-Thought (CoT) verification methods predict reasoning
correctness based on outputs (black-box) or activations (gray-box), but offer
limited insight into why a computation fails. We introduce a white-box method:
Circuit-based Reasoning Verification (CRV). We hypothesize that attribution
graphs of correct CoT steps, viewed as execution traces of the model's latent
reasoning circuits, possess distinct structural fingerprints from those of
incorrect steps. By training a classifier on structural features of these
graphs, we show that these traces contain a powerful signal of reasoning
errors. Our white-box approach yields novel scientific insights unattainable by
other methods. (1) We demonstrate that structural signatures of error are
highly predictive, establishing the viability of verifying reasoning directly
via its computational graph. (2) We find these signatures to be highly
domain-specific, revealing that failures in different reasoning tasks manifest
as distinct computational patterns. (3) We provide evidence that these
signatures are not merely correlational; by using our analysis to guide
targeted interventions on individual transcoder features, we successfully
correct the model's faulty reasoning. Our work shows that, by scrutinizing a
model's computational process, we can move from simple error detection to a
deeper, causal understanding of LLM reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型参数过多难以在资源受限硬件上部署的问题，传统均匀压缩方法会导致性能显著下降，且现有方法在解码阶段表现不佳。

Method: 提出细粒度低秩压缩器(FLRC)，为每层确定最优秩分配，并采用渐进低秩解码技术来维持文本生成质量。

Result: 在多样化基准测试中，FLRC在摘要任务上的ROUGE-L指标比最先进低秩压缩方法提升高达17%，建立了更稳健高效的LLM推理框架。

Conclusion: FLRC通过细粒度秩分配和渐进解码策略，有效解决了LLM低秩压缩中的性能退化问题，为资源受限环境下的模型部署提供了更优解决方案。

Abstract: Although large language models (LLM) have achieved remarkable performance,
their enormous parameter counts hinder deployment on resource-constrained
hardware. Low-rank compression can reduce both memory usage and computational
demand, but applying a uniform compression ratio across all layers often leads
to significant performance degradation, and previous methods perform poorly
during decoding. To address these issues, we propose the Fine-grained Low-Rank
Compressor (FLRC), which efficiently determines an optimal rank allocation for
each layer, and incorporates progressive low-rank decoding to maintain text
generation quality. Comprehensive experiments on diverse benchmarks demonstrate
the superiority of FLRC, achieving up to a 17% improvement in ROUGE-L on
summarization tasks compared to state-of-the-art low-rank compression methods,
establishing a more robust and efficient framework to improve LLM inference.

TL;DR: LLP是一个基于大语言模型的二手产品定价框架，通过检索相似产品和两阶段优化方法，显著提升了定价准确性和采用率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: C2C平台上的个人卖家在二手产品定价方面面临困难，现有静态回归模型泛化性能差且无法捕捉市场动态变化。

Method: LLP框架包含：1）检索相似产品；2）利用LLM理解自由文本中的定价信息；3）两阶段优化（SFT+GRPO）；4）基于置信度的过滤机制。

Result: 在闲鱼平台部署后，在30%产品覆盖率下，静态采用率从40%提升至72%，在90%召回率下仍保持47%的采用率。

Conclusion: LLP框架显著优于现有方法，能够很好地泛化到未见过的类别，成功解决了二手产品动态定价的挑战。

Abstract: Unlike Business-to-Consumer e-commerce platforms (e.g., Amazon),
inexperienced individual sellers on Consumer-to-Consumer platforms (e.g., eBay)
often face significant challenges in setting prices for their second-hand
products efficiently. Therefore, numerous studies have been proposed for
automating price prediction. However, most of them are based on static
regression models, which suffer from poor generalization performance and fail
to capture market dynamics (e.g., the price of a used iPhone decreases over
time). Inspired by recent breakthroughs in Large Language Models (LLMs), we
introduce LLP, the first LLM-based generative framework for second-hand product
pricing. LLP first retrieves similar products to better align with the dynamic
market change. Afterwards, it leverages the LLMs' nuanced understanding of key
pricing information in free-form text to generate accurate price suggestions.
To strengthen the LLMs' domain reasoning over retrieved products, we apply a
two-stage optimization, supervised fine-tuning (SFT) followed by group relative
policy optimization (GRPO), on a dataset built via bidirectional reasoning.
Moreover, LLP employs a confidence-based filtering mechanism to reject
unreliable price suggestions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LLP
substantially surpasses existing methods while generalizing well to unseen
categories. We have successfully deployed LLP on Xianyu\footnote\{Xianyu is
China's largest second-hand e-commerce platform.\}, significantly outperforming
the previous pricing method. Under the same 30\% product coverage, it raises
the static adoption rate (SAR) from 40\% to 72\%, and maintains a strong SAR of
47\% even at 90\% recall.

TL;DR: ReTraceQA是一个新的基准测试，通过过程级评估来评估常识推理任务，发现SLMs在14-24%的情况下虽然给出正确答案但推理过程有缺陷，表明仅关注最终答案的评估方法会高估SLMs的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前对小语言模型(SLMs)的评估主要依赖最终答案的准确性，而忽略了推理过程的有效性，这可能导致对SLMs能力的错误评估。

Method: 引入ReTraceQA基准测试，采用专家标注的数据集，并使用大型语言模型(LLMs)作为自动评判器进行推理感知评估。

Result: 研究发现SLMs在14-24%的实例中虽然给出正确答案但推理过程有缺陷；使用LLMs进行推理感知评估时，SLMs在所有模型和数据集上的性能显著下降，得分最多下降25%。

Conclusion: 仅关注最终答案的评估方法会显著高估SLMs的推理能力，过程级评估对于准确评估语言模型的真实推理能力至关重要。

Abstract: While Small Language Models (SLMs) have demonstrated promising performance on
an increasingly wide array of commonsense reasoning benchmarks, current
evaluation practices rely almost exclusively on the accuracy of their final
answers, neglecting the validity of the reasoning processes that lead to those
answers. To address this issue, we introduce ReTraceQA, a novel benchmark that
introduces process-level evaluation for commonsense reasoning tasks. Our
expert-annotated dataset reveals that in a substantial portion of instances
(14-24%), SLMs provide correct final answers despite flawed reasoning
processes, suggesting that the capabilities of SLMs are often overestimated by
evaluation metrics that focus only on comparing the final answer with the
ground truth. Indeed, we show that when employing strong Large Language Models
(LLMs) as automated judges for reasoning-aware evaluation rather than
answer-only metrics, SLM performance drops significantly across all models and
datasets, with scores decreasing by up to 25%.

Abstract: Large reasoning models exhibit long chain-of-thought reasoning with
strategies such as backtracking and self-correction, though recent studies
suggest that these abilities typically require additional training. We first
investigate whether such behaviors can be elicited without any training. To
this end, we propose a decoding-time approach, ThinkLogit, which utilizes logit
arithmetic to tune a target large non-reasoning model for long reasoning using
a substantially smaller reasoning model as the guider. We then show that we can
further boost its performance by training the guider model with preference
optimization over correct/incorrect reasoning pairs sampled from both the
target and guider model, a setup we refer to as ThinkLogit-DPO. Our experiments
demonstrate that ThinkLogit and ThinkLogit-DPO achieve a relative improvement
in average accuracy by 24.5% and 29.1%, respectively, over five reasoning
benchmarks using the Qwen2.5-32B guided by R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, a model 21x
smaller. Moreover, we find that ThinkLogit remains effective when the guider
and target come from different model families. It is also orthogonal to
post-training methods for small models, as guiders improved through supervised
distillation or reinforcement learning can be directly plugged in to yield
stronger large models, offering a practical path to unlock long reasoning in
large-scale models without costly post-training.

*Fang Yuan,Junjie Zeng,Yue Hu,Zhengqiu Zhu,Quanjun Yin,Yuxiang Xie*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了NL2GenSym框架，将大型语言模型与SOAR认知架构结合，从自然语言自动生成符号规则，解决了手动编码规则的效率问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SOAR认知架构需要手动编码规则，效率低下。大型语言模型具有生成规则的潜力，但缺乏实验验证。

Method: 采用执行驱动的生成器-评判器机制：LLM生成器基于检索增强生成访问领域知识库提出规则，在SOAR环境中执行验证，LLM评判器根据执行反馈迭代优化规则。

Result: 在Water Jug Problem数据集上，规则生成成功率超过86%，生成的新启发式规则将平均决策周期降至最优解的1.98倍，是基线方法的1/1000。较小参数模型也能获得更好性能。

Conclusion: NL2GenSym框架有效解决了SOAR规则生成问题，展示了LLM与符号系统结合的潜力，为构建更智能的代理系统提供了新途径。

Abstract: SOAR, a classic symbol-based cognitive architecture, has been fostering the
development of general, human-like intelligent agents. Nevertheless, its
practical adoption is hindered by the laborious manual rule coding. Emerging
Large Language Models (LLMs) present the immense potential for efficient rules
generation. However, there is a critical gap that current research
predominantly focuses on conceptual frameworks and lacks robust experimental
validation. To bridge this gap, we propose \textit{N}atural \textit{L}anguage
to \textit{Gen}erative \textit{Sym}bolic Rules (NL2GenSym), a novel framework
that integrates LLMs with SOAR to autonomously produce generative symbolic
rules from natural language. Specifically, our framework introduces a novel
Execution-Grounded Generator-Critic mechanism. The LLM-based Generator, guided
by a Retrieval-Augmented Generation-accessed self-evolving domain knowledge
base, proposes rules from natural language. Subsequently, these rules are
immediately executed within the SOAR environment to rigorously validate their
correctness. Based on this execution-grounded feedback, a reflective LLM-based
Critic drives the iterative refinement of these rules. Experiments on our
specialized Water Jug Problem (WJP) dataset, utilizing both Gemini and Qwen
series models, validate the efficacy of our framework. It achieves a success
rate over 86\% in generating rules from natural language. Crucially, the
framework also generates novel heuristic rules, reducing average decision
cycles for solving the WJP to 1.98 times the optimal solution and 1/1000 of
baseline methods. Additionally, our initial experiments show that NL2GenSym
enables smaller-parameter models to achieve better performance than larger
counterparts.

TL;DR: 本文首次系统研究大型医学语言模型中的领域特定微调，发现微调仅改变表示子空间的小部分，提出tuning vectors框架来捕捉参数方向性变化，这些向量能提升指令跟随和生成质量，并改善跨领域泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解领域特定微调如何重塑LLMs的参数空间机制，现有研究主要关注自回归或通用指令模型，而领域专业化LLMs研究不足。

Method: 提出tuning vectors框架（受task vectors启发），显式捕捉微调引起的参数方向性变化，分析这些向量在模型不同层（MLP和注意力头）中的行为。

Result: 微调仅修改表示子空间的小部分，保持预训练模型表示；tuning vectors能提升指令跟随和生成质量；组合不同领域的tuning vectors可改善泛化；这些向量主要在MLP层写入新方向信息，在注意力头中放大现有方向。

Conclusion: 研究为LLM适应提供了新见解，并为分析大型语言模型专业化提供了通用、可解释的框架。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) fine-tuned for specific domains exhibit strong
performance; however, the underlying mechanisms by which this fine-tuning
reshapes their parametric space are not well understood. Prior works primarily
focus on auto-regressive or general-purpose instruct models, leaving
domain-specialised LLMs under-explored. We present the first systematic study
of domain-specific fine-tuning in large medical language models. Our analysis
reveals that fine-tuning modifies only a small subset of the representational
subspace, essentially preserving the pre-trained model's representation. To
interpret these changes in subspaces, we propose tuning vectors, a novel
framework inspired by task vectors, which explicitly capture the directional
parameter shifts induced by fine-tuning. We demonstrate that these vectors are
critical for enhancing both instruction-following and generation quality.
Furthermore, combining tuning vectors across different domains yields improved
generalisation. Upon closer inspection of directional alignment, we find these
vectors primarily write new directional information into the MLP layers of the
model, while amplifying existing directions in attention heads. Our findings
offer new insights into LLM adaptation and provide a general, interpretable
framework for analysing specialisation in large language models.

<details>

Motivation: GRPO和相关熵正则化方法在链式思维推理中面临稀疏token奖励的挑战，现有方法依赖无差别的token级熵调整，常导致熵崩溃或模型崩溃。

Method: 提出TEPO框架，引入马尔可夫似然，通过token级聚合将组级奖励与token联系起来。

Result: 实验表明TEPO在关键指标上持续优于现有基线，在数学推理任务上达到新SOTA，并显著提升训练稳定性。

Conclusion: TEPO通过token级框架有效解决了GRPO等方法的局限性，在数学推理性能和训练稳定性方面都取得了显著提升。

Abstract: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has significantly advanced the
reasoning ability of large language models (LLMs), particularly by boosting
their mathematical performance. However, GRPO and related
entropy-regularization methods still face challenges rooted in the sparse token
rewards inherent to chain-of-thought (CoT). Current approaches often rely on
undifferentiated token-level entropy adjustments, which frequently lead to
entropy collapse or model collapse. In this work, we propose TEPO, a novel
token-level framework that incorporates Markov Likelihood (sequence likelihood)
links group-level rewards with tokens via token-level aggregation. Experiments
show that TEPO consistently outperforms existing baselines across key metrics
(including @k and accuracy). It not only sets a new state of the art on
mathematical reasoning tasks but also significantly enhances training
stability.

Motivation: 人机交互中目标共享存在歧义，导致输出看似正确但不符合用户意图，特别是在数据可视化领域，自然语言的歧义会影响代码生成质量。

Method: 开发歧义分类体系，提出量化指标，使用DS-1000数据集中的Matplotlib问题验证指标，并评估三种语用模型（Gricean合作原则、话语表征理论、问题讨论框架）的多轮对话策略。

Result: 歧义指标比不确定性基线更符合人工标注，多轮对话能有效减少歧义，提高代码准确性，模拟用户研究验证了语用对话的价值。

Conclusion: 多轮对话是减少歧义、提高代码生成准确性的有效方法，语用模型在人机交互中具有重要价值。

Abstract: Establishing shared goals is a fundamental step in human-AI communication.
However, ambiguities can lead to outputs that seem correct but fail to reflect
the speaker's intent. In this paper, we explore this issue with a focus on the
data visualization domain, where ambiguities in natural language impact the
generation of code that visualizes data. The availability of multiple views on
the contextual (e.g., the intended plot and the code rendering the plot) allows
for a unique and comprehensive analysis of diverse ambiguity types. We develop
a taxonomy of types of ambiguity that arise in this task and propose metrics to
quantify them. Using Matplotlib problems from the DS-1000 dataset, we
demonstrate that our ambiguity metrics better correlate with human annotations
than uncertainty baselines. Our work also explores how multi-turn dialogue can
reduce ambiguity, therefore, improve code accuracy by better matching user
goals. We evaluate three pragmatic models to inform our dialogue strategies:
Gricean Cooperativity, Discourse Representation Theory, and Questions under
Discussion. A simulated user study reveals how pragmatic dialogues reduce
ambiguity and enhance code accuracy, highlighting the value of multi-turn
exchanges in code generation.

Motivation: 现有图提示调优方法局限于单粒度提示生成，忽略了图数据固有的多尺度结构信息，限制了提示语义的多样性

Method: 设计轻量级低秩粗化网络捕获多尺度结构特征作为层次基向量，模仿人类从粗到细的认知过程动态整合多尺度信息

Result: 在8个基准数据集上的实验表明，MSGCOT优于最先进的单粒度图提示调优方法，特别是在少样本场景下表现优异

Conclusion: 多尺度信息集成能有效提升图提示调优性能，特别是在数据稀缺情况下

Abstract: The "pre-train, prompt'' paradigm, designed to bridge the gap between
pre-training tasks and downstream objectives, has been extended from the NLP
domain to the graph domain and has achieved remarkable progress. Current
mainstream graph prompt-tuning methods modify input or output features using
learnable prompt vectors. However, existing approaches are confined to
single-granularity (e.g., node-level or subgraph-level) during prompt
generation, overlooking the inherently multi-scale structural information in
graph data, which limits the diversity of prompt semantics. To address this
issue, we pioneer the integration of multi-scale information into graph prompt
and propose a Multi-Scale Graph Chain-of-Thought (MSGCOT) prompting framework.
Specifically, we design a lightweight, low-rank coarsening network to
efficiently capture multi-scale structural features as hierarchical basis
vectors for prompt generation. Subsequently, mimicking human cognition from
coarse-to-fine granularity, we dynamically integrate multi-scale information at
each reasoning step, forming a progressive coarse-to-fine prompt chain.
Extensive experiments on eight benchmark datasets demonstrate that MSGCOT
outperforms the state-of-the-art single-granularity graph prompt-tuning method,
particularly in few-shot scenarios, showcasing superior performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型评估方法需要完全标注的数据集，标注成本高昂。需要开发能够用有限标注有效识别最佳模型的框架。

Method: 提出LLM SELECTOR框架，自适应选择信息量最大的查询进行标注，利用基于评判者的标注模型进一步减少标注需求。

Result: 在6个基准测试和151个LLM上的实验表明，LLM SELECTOR在选择最佳和接近最佳模型时，标注成本降低高达59.62%。

Conclusion: LLM SELECTOR为高效的大语言模型选择提供了实用解决方案，显著降低了模型评估的标注成本。

Abstract: We introduce LLM SELECTOR, the first framework for active model selection of
Large Language Models (LLMs). Unlike prior evaluation and benchmarking
approaches that rely on fully annotated datasets, LLM SELECTOR efficiently
identifies the best LLM with limited annotations. In particular, for any given
task, LLM SELECTOR adaptively selects a small set of queries to annotate that
are most informative about the best model for the task. To further reduce
annotation cost, we leverage a judge-based oracle annotation model. Through
extensive experiments on 6 benchmarks with 151 LLMs, we show that LLM SELECTOR
reduces annotation costs by up to 59.62% when selecting the best and near-best
LLM for the task.

Motivation: 尽管命名实体是文本知识的基础构件，但LLM内部如何表示实体仍不清楚。现有研究主要关注显式关系，对实体表示本身知之甚少。

Method: 引入实体提及重构框架，利用任务向量从LLM隐藏状态中生成多词元实体提及，扩展logit-lens为Entity Lens来预测多词元提及。

Result: 发现LLM开发了实体特定机制来表示和操作任何多词元实体，包括训练期间未见过的实体。

Conclusion: LLM内部形成了专门的实体表示机制，能够编码和操作多词元实体，这为理解LLM的知识表示提供了新证据。

Abstract: Named entities are fundamental building blocks of knowledge in text,
grounding factual information and structuring relationships within language.
Despite their importance, it remains unclear how Large Language Models (LLMs)
internally represent entities. Prior research has primarily examined explicit
relationships, but little is known about entity representations themselves. We
introduce entity mention reconstruction as a novel framework for studying how
LLMs encode and manipulate entities. We investigate whether entity mentions can
be generated from internal representations, how multi-token entities are
encoded beyond last-token embeddings, and whether these representations capture
relational knowledge. Our proposed method, leveraging _task vectors_, allows to
consistently generate multi-token mentions from various entity representations
derived from the LLMs hidden states. We thus introduce the _Entity Lens_,
extending the _logit-lens_ to predict multi-token mentions. Our results bring
new evidence that LLMs develop entity-specific mechanisms to represent and
manipulate any multi-token entities, including those unseen during training.

Method: 系统评估了传统多模态上下文、完整口语历史和压缩口语历史三种方法，在SpokenWOZ语料库上进行实验。

Result: 完整口语对话输入在相似规模模型中性能最高，显著超越先前方法；注意力池化压缩方法在减小上下文大小的同时保持竞争力。

Conclusion: 改进源于更有效的上下文利用，完整口语历史输入是最佳策略，压缩方法提供了良好的权衡。

Abstract: This paper presents a comparative study of context management strategies for

evaluate traditional multimodal context (combining text history and spoken

Our experiments on the SpokenWOZ corpus demonstrate that providing the full
spoken conversation as input yields the highest performance among models of
similar size, significantly surpassing prior methods. Furthermore, we show that
attention-pooling-based compression of the spoken history offers a strong
trade-off, maintaining competitive accuracy with reduced context size. Detailed

Abstract: This work presents the first large-scale investigation into constructing a
fully open bilingual large language model (LLM) for a non-English language,
specifically Korean, trained predominantly on synthetic data. We introduce
KORMo-10B, a 10.8B-parameter model trained from scratch on a Korean-English
corpus in which 68.74% of the Korean portion is synthetic. Through systematic
experimentation, we demonstrate that synthetic data, when carefully curated
with balanced linguistic coverage and diverse instruction styles, does not
cause instability or degradation during large-scale pretraining. Furthermore,
the model achieves performance comparable to that of contemporary open-weight
multilingual baselines across a wide range of reasoning, knowledge, and
instruction-following benchmarks. Our experiments reveal two key findings: (1)
synthetic data can reliably sustain long-horizon pretraining without model
collapse, and (2) bilingual instruction tuning enables near-native reasoning
and discourse coherence in Korean. By fully releasing all components including
data, code, training recipes, and logs, this work establishes a transparent
framework for developing synthetic data-driven fully open models (FOMs) in
low-resource settings and sets a reproducible precedent for future multilingual

Abstract: Free-text crash narratives recorded in real-world crash databases have been
shown to play a significant role in improving traffic safety. However,
large-scale analyses remain difficult to implement as there are no documented
tools that can batch process the unstructured, non standardized text content
written by various authors with diverse experience and attention to detail. In
recent years, Transformer-based pre-trained language models (PLMs), such as
Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) and large
language models (LLMs), have demonstrated strong capabilities across various
natural language processing tasks. These models can extract explicit facts from
crash narratives, but their performance declines on inference-heavy tasks in,
for example, Crash Type identification, which can involve nearly 100
categories. Moreover, relying on closed LLMs through external APIs raises
privacy concerns for sensitive crash data. Additionally, these black-box tools
often underperform due to limited domain knowledge. Motivated by these
challenges, we study whether compact open-source PLMs can support
reasoning-intensive extraction from crash narratives. We target two challenging
objectives: 1) identifying the Manner of Collision for a crash, and 2) Crash
Type for each vehicle involved in the crash event from real-world crash
narratives. To bridge domain gaps, we apply fine-tuning techniques to inject
task-specific knowledge to LLMs with Low-Rank Adaption (LoRA) and BERT.
Experiments on the authoritative real-world dataset Crash Investigation
Sampling System (CISS) demonstrate that our fine-tuned compact models
outperform strong closed LLMs, such as GPT-4o, while requiring only minimal
training resources. Further analysis reveals that the fine-tuned PLMs can
capture richer narrative details and even correct some mislabeled annotations
in the dataset.

Conclusion: 该研究为其他团队的大规模数据索引提供了参考，促进了向绿色计算的转型，同时实现了之前无法实现的与越狱无关的LLM安全保证。

Abstract: The performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) is determined by their
training data. Despite the proliferation of open-weight LLMs, access to LLM
training data has remained limited. Even for fully open LLMs, the scale of the
data makes it all but inscrutable to the general scientific community, despite
potentially containing critical data scraped from the internet.
  In this paper, we present the full-text indexing pipeline for the Apertus LLM
training data. Leveraging Elasticsearch parallel indices and the Alps
infrastructure, a state-of-the-art, highly energy-efficient arm64 supercluster,
we were able to index 8.6T tokens out of 15.2T used to train the Apertus LLM
family, creating both a critical LLM safety tool and effectively an offline,
curated, open web search engine. Our contribution is threefold. First, we
demonstrate that Elasticsearch can be successfully ported onto next-generation
arm64-based infrastructure. Second, we demonstrate that full-text indexing at
the scale of modern LLM training datasets and the entire open web is feasible
and accessible. Finally, we demonstrate that such indices can be used to ensure
previously inaccessible jailbreak-agnostic LLM safety.
  We hope that our findings will be useful to other teams attempting
large-scale data indexing and facilitate the general transition towards greener
computation.

Conclusion: 混合模型有潜力有效解决神经推理系统中的关键泛化障碍，神经组件加速处理，符号推理确保完整性

Abstract: Despite the remarkable progress in neural models, their ability to
generalize, a cornerstone for applications like logical reasoning, remains a
critical challenge. We delineate two fundamental aspects of this ability:
compositionality, the capacity to abstract atomic logical rules underlying
complex inferences, and recursiveness, the aptitude to build intricate
representations through iterative application of inference rules. In the
literature, these two aspects are often confounded together under the umbrella
term of generalization. To sharpen this distinction, we investigated the
logical generalization capabilities of pre-trained large language models (LLMs)
using the syllogistic fragment as a benchmark for natural language reasoning.
Though simple, this fragment provides a foundational yet expressive subset of
formal logic that supports controlled evaluation of essential reasoning
abilities. Our findings reveal a significant disparity: while LLMs demonstrate
reasonable proficiency in recursiveness, they struggle with compositionality.
To overcome these limitations and establish a reliable logical prover, we
propose a hybrid architecture integrating symbolic reasoning with neural
computation. This synergistic interaction enables robust and efficient
inference, neural components accelerate processing, while symbolic reasoning
ensures completeness. Our experiments show that high efficiency is preserved
even with relatively small neural components. As part of our proposed
methodology, this analysis gives a rationale and highlights the potential of
hybrid models to effectively address key generalization barriers in neural
reasoning systems.

Conclusion: 作为多模态策略内化的首个工作，提供了数据集、训练方案和全面评估，推动未来研究。

Abstract: Modern conversational agents like ChatGPT and Alexa+ rely on predefined
policies specifying metadata, response styles, and tool-usage rules. As these
LLM-based systems expand to support diverse business and user queries, such
policies, often implemented as in-context prompts, are becoming increasingly
complex and lengthy, making faithful adherence difficult and imposing large
fixed computational costs. With the rise of multimodal agents, policies that
govern visual and multimodal behaviors are critical but remain understudied.
Prior prompt-compression work mainly shortens task templates and
demonstrations, while existing policy-alignment studies focus only on
text-based safety rules. We introduce Multimodal Policy Internalization (MPI),
a new task that internalizes reasoning-intensive multimodal policies into model
parameters, enabling stronger policy-following without including the policy
during inference. MPI poses unique data and algorithmic challenges. We build
two datasets spanning synthetic and real-world decision-making and tool-using
tasks and propose TriMPI, a three-stage training framework. TriMPI first
injects policy knowledge via continual pretraining, then performs supervised
finetuning, and finally applies PolicyRollout, a GRPO-style reinforcement
learning extension that augments rollouts with policy-aware responses for
grounded exploration. TriMPI achieves notable gains in end-to-end accuracy,
generalization, and robustness to forgetting. As the first work on multimodal
policy internalization, we provide datasets, training recipes, and
comprehensive evaluations to foster future research. Project page:

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable advances in
mathematical and logical reasoning, yet statistics, as a distinct and
integrative discipline, remains underexplored in benchmarking efforts. To
address this gap, we introduce \textbf{StatEval}, the first comprehensive
benchmark dedicated to statistics, spanning both breadth and depth across
difficulty levels. StatEval consists of 13,817 foundational problems covering
undergraduate and graduate curricula, together with 2374 research-level proof
tasks extracted from leading journals. To construct the benchmark, we design a
scalable multi-agent pipeline with human-in-the-loop validation that automates
large-scale problem extraction, rewriting, and quality control, while ensuring
academic rigor. We further propose a robust evaluation framework tailored to
both computational and proof-based tasks, enabling fine-grained assessment of
reasoning ability. Experimental results reveal that while closed-source models
such as GPT5-mini achieve below 57\% on research-level problems, with
open-source models performing significantly lower. These findings highlight the
unique challenges of statistical reasoning and the limitations of current LLMs.
We expect StatEval to serve as a rigorous benchmark for advancing statistical
intelligence in large language models. All data and code are available on our
web platform: https://stateval.github.io/.

TL;DR: 本文分析了无标签情况下评估NLP模型跨域性能排名的可靠性，发现基于大语言模型的错误预测器比基于数据集漂移或零样本基线方法产生更准确和一致的性能排名。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解NLP模型如何泛化到新领域时，需要在没有真实标签的情况下估计模型性能。现有方法基于数据集相似性或预测正确性，但它们在跨域性能排名方面的可靠性尚不明确。

Method: 采用两步评估框架，使用四个基础分类器和多个大语言模型作为错误预测器，在GeoOLID和Amazon Reviews数据集的15个领域上进行实验，比较基于大语言模型的错误预测器与基于漂移和零样本基线方法的性能。

Result: 实验表明，基于大语言模型的错误预测器与真实准确率之间的秩相关性更强且更一致。当跨域性能差异较大，且错误模型的预测与基础模型真实失败模式一致时，排名可靠性更高。

Conclusion: 研究结果明确了性能估计方法在跨域模型评估中何时可信，并为其使用提供了指导。

Abstract: Estimating model performance without labels is an important goal for
understanding how NLP models generalize. While prior work has proposed measures
based on dataset similarity or predicted correctness, it remains unclear when
these estimates produce reliable performance rankings across domains. In this
paper, we analyze the factors that affect ranking reliability using a two-step
evaluation setup with four base classifiers and several large language models
as error predictors. Experiments on the GeoOLID and Amazon Reviews datasets,
spanning 15 domains, show that large language model-based error predictors
produce stronger and more consistent rank correlations with true accuracy than
drift-based or zero-shot baselines. Our analysis reveals two key findings:
ranking is more reliable when performance differences across domains are
larger, and when the error model's predictions align with the base model's true
failure patterns. These results clarify when performance estimation methods can
be trusted and provide guidance for their use in cross-domain model evaluation.

TL;DR: 提出了一种口音不变的ASR框架，通过集成口音分类和掩码数据增强来提高模型对英语和波斯语口音变化的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练Transformer模型在ASR中表现优异，但对口音和方言变化敏感，导致在英语和波斯语等语言多样性语言中词错误率升高。

Method: 训练基于频谱图的口音分类器，识别关键口音特征区域并掩码，使用掩码后的频谱图进行数据增强。

Result: 在英语和波斯语实验中，使用Whisper模型验证了该方法能显著降低词错误率，并为波斯语建立了首个系统性口音变化基准数据集。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了多语言ASR系统对口音和方言多样性的鲁棒性，为低资源语言多样性语言研究提供了基础。

Abstract: Pre-trained transformer-based models have significantly advanced automatic
speech recognition (ASR), yet they remain sensitive to accent and dialectal
variations, resulting in elevated word error rates (WER) in linguistically
diverse languages such as English and Persian. To address this challenge, we
propose an accent-invariant ASR framework that integrates accent and dialect
classification into the recognition pipeline. Our approach involves training a
spectrogram-based classifier to capture accent-specific cues, masking the
regions most influential to its predictions, and using the masked spectrograms
for data augmentation. This enhances the robustness of ASR models against
accent variability. We evaluate the method using both English and Persian
speech. For Persian, we introduce a newly collected dataset spanning multiple
regional accents, establishing the first systematic benchmark for accent
variation in Persian ASR that fills a critical gap in multilingual speech
research and provides a foundation for future studies on low-resource,
linguistically diverse languages. Experimental results with the Whisper model
demonstrate that our masking and augmentation strategy yields substantial WER
reductions in both English and Persian settings, confirming the effectiveness
of the approach. This research advances the development of multilingual ASR
systems that are resilient to accent and dialect diversity. Code and dataset
are publicly available at: https://github.com/MH-Sameti/Accent_invariant_ASR

TL;DR: 提出GRSP方法，通过步骤级监督来平衡推理模型的效率与准确性，避免过度思考问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于验证器奖励的强化学习方法在减少推理长度时往往损害模型性能，需要更细粒度的监督机制

Method: 提出组相对段惩罚(GRSP)，基于推理段设计长度感知的权重机制，在段级别进行正则化

Result: GRSP在保持准确性的同时显著提升token效率，特别是在困难问题上表现更优，且能稳定强化学习训练

Conclusion: 监督粒度对平衡推理模型的效率与准确性至关重要，GRSP为这一挑战提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) boosted by Reinforcement Learning from Verifier
Reward (RLVR) have shown great power in problem solving, yet they often cause
overthinking: excessive, meandering reasoning that inflates computational cost.
Prior designs of penalization in RLVR manage to reduce token consumption while
often harming model performance, which arises from the oversimplicity of
token-level supervision. In this paper, we argue that the granularity of
supervision plays a crucial role in balancing efficiency and accuracy, and
propose Group Relative Segment Penalization (GRSP), a step-level method to
regularize reasoning. Since preliminary analyses show that reasoning segments
are strongly correlated with token consumption and model performance, we design
a length-aware weighting mechanism across segment clusters. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that GRSP achieves superior token efficiency without
heavily compromising accuracy, especially the advantages with harder problems.
Moreover, GRSP stabilizes RL training and scales effectively across model
sizes.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MulTypo是一个多语言拼写错误生成算法，用于评估LLM在包含拼写错误的输入下的鲁棒性。研究发现拼写错误会显著降低模型性能，特别是在生成任务和需要推理的任务中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试通常假设输入是干净的，而真实应用中用户输入常包含拼写错误，因此需要评估LLM在多语言环境下对拼写错误的鲁棒性。

Method: 开发MulTypo算法，基于语言特定的键盘布局和打字行为模拟人类拼写错误，评估18个开源LLM在5个下游任务上的表现。

Result: 拼写错误持续降低性能，生成任务和推理任务受影响最大；指令微调提高干净输入性能但可能增加对噪声的脆弱性；高资源语言比低资源语言更鲁棒。

Conclusion: 需要噪声感知训练和多语言鲁棒性评估，以提升LLM在真实应用中的表现。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in multilingual,
real-world applications with user inputs -- naturally introducing typographical
errors (typos). Yet most benchmarks assume clean input, leaving the robustness
of LLMs to typos across languages largely underexplored. To address this gap,
we introduce MulTypo, a multilingual typo generation algorithm that simulates
human-like errors based on language-specific keyboard layouts and typing
behavior. We evaluate 18 open-source LLMs across three model families and five
downstream tasks spanning language inference, multi-choice question answering,
mathematical reasoning, and machine translation tasks. Our results show that
typos consistently degrade performance, particularly in generative tasks and
those requiring reasoning -- while the natural language inference task is
comparatively more robust. Instruction tuning improves clean-input performance
but may increase brittleness under noise. We also observe language-dependent
robustness: high-resource languages are generally more robust than low-resource
ones, and translation from English is more robust than translation into
English. Our findings underscore the need for noise-aware training and
multilingual robustness evaluation. We make our code and data publicly
available.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了Sandwiched Policy Gradient (SPG)方法，通过使用真实对数似然的上界和下界来解决扩散大语言模型(dLLMs)强化学习中的策略梯度偏差问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散大语言模型(dLLMs)因其能够并行解码多个标记而成为自回归模型的高效替代品，但由于其难以处理的对数似然，无法直接应用标准策略梯度方法进行人类偏好或任务特定奖励的对齐。

Method: 提出了Sandwiched Policy Gradient (SPG)方法，利用真实对数似然的上界和下界来减少策略梯度偏差，相比之前基于证据下界(ELBO)或一步估计的方法提供了更准确的近似。

Result: 实验表明SPG显著优于基于ELBO或一步估计的基线方法，在GSM8K、MATH500、Countdown和Sudoku任务上分别提高了3.6%、2.6%、18.4%和27.0%的准确率。

Conclusion: SPG方法通过使用对数似然的双边界限，有效解决了dLLMs强化学习中的策略梯度偏差问题，在多个任务上取得了显著的性能提升。

Abstract: Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) are emerging as an efficient
alternative to autoregressive models due to their ability to decode multiple
tokens in parallel. However, aligning dLLMs with human preferences or
task-specific rewards via reinforcement learning (RL) is challenging because
their intractable log-likelihood precludes the direct application of standard
policy gradient methods. While prior work uses surrogates like the evidence
lower bound (ELBO), these one-sided approximations can introduce significant
policy gradient bias. To address this, we propose the Sandwiched Policy
Gradient (SPG) that leverages both an upper and a lower bound of the true
log-likelihood. Experiments show that SPG significantly outperforms baselines
based on ELBO or one-step estimation. Specifically, SPG improves the accuracy
over state-of-the-art RL methods for dLLMs by 3.6% in GSM8K, 2.6% in MATH500,
18.4% in Countdown and 27.0% in Sudoku.

TL;DR: 扩散大语言模型(DLLMs)存在并行-顺序矛盾(PSC)，限制了其在复杂推理任务中的并行解码能力，导致推理深度和探索广度受限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究DLLMs在并行解码与因果推理顺序之间的冲突，识别并行-顺序矛盾(PSC)对推理性能的影响。

Method: 通过行为分析研究DLLMs在简单和复杂推理任务中的表现，引入三个扩展维度(并行、扩散、顺序)，并提出并行导向提示、扩散早停和并行扩展等缓解策略。

Result: DLLMs仅在可直接判定的输出中展现真正并行性，任务难度增加时退化为自回归行为；并行扩展带来持续改进，但扩散和顺序扩展受PSC限制。

Conclusion: PSC是DLLMs推理能力的主要限制因素，需要针对性的缓解策略来提升推理效果和效率。

Abstract: Recently, Diffusion Large Language Models (DLLMs) have offered high
throughput and effective sequential reasoning, making them a competitive
alternative to autoregressive LLMs (ALLMs). However, parallel decoding, which
enables simultaneous token updates, conflicts with the causal order often
required for rigorous reasoning. We first identify this conflict as the core
Parallel-Sequential Contradiction (PSC). Behavioral analyses in both simple and
complex reasoning tasks show that DLLMs exhibit genuine parallelism only for
directly decidable outputs. As task difficulty increases, they revert to
autoregressive-like behavior, a limitation exacerbated by autoregressive
prompting, which nearly doubles the number of decoding steps with remasking
without improving quality. Moreover, PSC restricts DLLMs' self-reflection,
reasoning depth, and exploratory breadth. To further characterize PSC, we
introduce three scaling dimensions for DLLMs: parallel, diffusion, and
sequential. Empirically, while parallel scaling yields consistent improvements,
diffusion and sequential scaling are constrained by PSC. Based on these
findings, we propose several practical mitigations, parallel-oriented
prompting, diffusion early stopping, and parallel scaling, to reduce
PSC-induced ineffectiveness and inefficiencies.

TL;DR: Dyna-Mind是一个两阶段训练框架，通过模拟增强AI代理在复杂交互环境中的推理和决策能力。第一阶段ReSim训练代理从真实环境交互中生成结构化推理轨迹，第二阶段Dyna-GRPO使用强化学习进一步优化模拟和决策能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI代理在数学和编程方面表现出色，但在长时程交互任务（如网页导航和设备使用）中表现不佳。受人类认知研究启发，认为AI需要"替代性试错"能力，即在行动前进行心理模拟来增强复杂环境中的理解和性能。

Method: 提出Dyna-Mind两阶段框架：1) ReSim阶段：通过环境交互收集真实经验，构建扩展搜索树，训练代理生成结构化推理轨迹；2) Dyna-GRPO阶段：使用在线强化学习方法，结合结果奖励和中间状态反馈来增强模拟和决策能力。

Result: 在三个基准测试（Sokoban、ALFWorld和AndroidWorld）上的实验表明：1) ReSim有效为AI代理注入模拟能力；2) Dyna-GRPO利用结果和交互级信号学习更好的长时程规划密集型任务策略。

Conclusion: 模拟在使AI代理在日益具有挑战性的环境中更有效地推理、规划和行动方面发挥着核心作用。Dyna-Mind框架通过系统性地整合模拟能力，显著提升了代理在复杂交互任务中的表现。

Abstract: Reasoning models have recently shown remarkable progress in domains such as
math and coding. However, their expert-level abilities in math and coding
contrast sharply with their performance in long-horizon, interactive tasks such
as web navigation and computer/phone-use. Inspired by literature on human
cognition, we argue that current AI agents need ''vicarious trial and error'' -
the capacity to mentally simulate alternative futures before acting - in order
to enhance their understanding and performance in complex interactive
environments. We introduce Dyna-Mind, a two-stage training framework that
explicitly teaches (V)LM agents to integrate such simulation into their
reasoning. In stage 1, we introduce Reasoning with Simulations (ReSim), which
trains the agent to generate structured reasoning traces from expanded search
trees built from real experience gathered through environment interactions.
ReSim thus grounds the agent's reasoning in faithful world dynamics and equips
it with the ability to anticipate future states in its reasoning. In stage 2,
we propose Dyna-GRPO, an online reinforcement learning method to further
strengthen the agent's simulation and decision-making ability by using both
outcome rewards and intermediate states as feedback from real rollouts.
Experiments on two synthetic benchmarks (Sokoban and ALFWorld) and one
realistic benchmark (AndroidWorld) demonstrate that (1) ReSim effectively
infuses simulation ability into AI agents, and (2) Dyna-GRPO leverages outcome
and interaction-level signals to learn better policies for long-horizon,
planning-intensive tasks. Together, these results highlight the central role of
simulation in enabling AI agents to reason, plan, and act more effectively in
the ever more challenging environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多语言医学视频档案中检索相关教学视频的挑战，现有系统要么将长视频压缩为粗糙嵌入，要么细粒度匹配成本过高，需要平衡检索精度和计算效率。

Method: 将视频字幕分为语义连贯的块，用知识图谱事实增强，构建层次化树结构，使用语言无关的多语言编码器生成节点嵌入。查询时进行粗到精树搜索剪枝，仅对排名靠前的块用轻量级LLM重新评分。

Result: 在mVCR测试集上达到最先进性能，消融研究证实知识图谱增强、层次化索引和针对性LLM重排序的互补贡献。

Conclusion: 该方法为专业医学视频集合中的多语言检索提供了准确且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Retrieving relevant instructional videos from multilingual medical archives
is crucial for answering complex, multi-hop questions across language
boundaries. However, existing systems either compress hour-long videos into
coarse embeddings or incur prohibitive costs for fine-grained matching. We
tackle the Multilingual Video Corpus Retrieval (mVCR) task in the NLPCC-2025
M4IVQA challenge with a multi-stage framework that integrates multilingual
semantics, domain terminology, and efficient long-form processing. Video
subtitles are divided into semantically coherent chunks, enriched with concise
knowledge-graph (KG) facts, and organized into a hierarchical tree whose node
embeddings are generated by a language-agnostic multilingual encoder. At query
time, the same encoder embeds the input question; a coarse-to-fine tree search
prunes irrelevant branches, and only the top-ranked chunks are re-scored by a
lightweight large language model (LLM). This design avoids exhaustive
cross-encoder scoring while preserving chunk-level precision. Experiments on
the mVCR test set demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, and ablation
studies confirm the complementary contributions of KG enrichment, hierarchical
indexing, and targeted LLM re-ranking. The proposed method offers an accurate
and scalable solution for multilingual retrieval in specialized medical video
collections.

TL;DR: 本文首次对多语言CoT推理进行系统研究，评估了性能、一致性和忠实性三个维度，揭示了不同语言间思维轨迹的质量和有效性存在显著差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然大型推理模型越来越多地使用CoT推理来提高任务性能，但在多语言环境中，导致最终答案的中间思维轨迹本身仍未得到充分探索。

Method: 通过测量语言合规性、答案准确性和一致性来评估LRMs；通过跨语言交换思维轨迹评估一致性；采用截断和错误注入等扰动技术来探测思维轨迹的忠实性。

Result: 研究发现模型具有强烈的语言偏好，不同语言间性能差异明显；思维轨迹的质量和有效性因提示语言而异；模型在不同语言中对思维轨迹的依赖程度不同。

Conclusion: 多语言CoT推理在不同语言间存在显著差异，思维轨迹的质量、有效性和忠实性都受到语言因素的影响，这为未来研究提供了重要启示。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) increasingly rely on step-by-step
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning to improve task performance, particularly in
high-resource languages such as English. While recent work has examined
final-answer accuracy in multilingual settings, the thinking traces themselves,
i.e., the intermediate steps that lead to the final answer, remain
underexplored. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive study of
multilingual CoT reasoning, evaluating three key dimensions: performance,
consistency, and faithfulness. We begin by measuring language compliance,
answer accuracy, and answer consistency when LRMs are explicitly instructed or
prompt-hacked to think in a target language, revealing strong language
preferences and divergent performance across languages. Next, we assess
crosslingual consistency of thinking traces by interchanging them between
languages. We find that the quality and effectiveness of thinking traces vary
substantially depending on the prompt language. Finally, we adapt
perturbation-based techniques -- i.e., truncation and error injection -- to
probe the faithfulness of thinking traces across languages, showing that models
rely on traces to varying degrees. We release our code and data to support
future research.

Method: 构建了包含8,880个刺激项的WUGNECTIVES数据集，评估了17个不同规模和训练方式的语言模型，特别关注连接词如何连接实体与属性。

Result: 调整语言模型以展示推理行为在大多数连接词类型上带来显著改进，但所有模型在表达让步意义的连接词上都系统性地表现不佳。

Conclusion: 研究结果为更细致地探索语言线索在语言模型中的功能作用铺平了道路。

Abstract: The role of world knowledge has been particularly crucial to predict the
discourse connective that marks the discourse relation between two arguments,
with language models (LMs) being generally successful at this task. We flip
this premise in our work, and instead study the inverse problem of
understanding whether discourse connectives can inform LMs about the world. To
this end, we present WUGNECTIVES, a dataset of 8,880 stimuli that evaluates
LMs' inferences about novel entities in contexts where connectives link the
entities to particular attributes. On investigating 17 different LMs at various
scales, and training regimens, we found that tuning an LM to show reasoning
behavior yields noteworthy improvements on most connectives. At the same time,
there was a large variation in LMs' overall performance across connective type,
with all models systematically struggling on connectives that express a
concessive meaning. Our findings pave the way for more nuanced investigations
into the functional role of language cues as captured by LMs. We release
WUGNECTIVES at https://github.com/sheffwb/wugnectives.

Abstract: As the volume of peer-reviewed research surges, scholars increasingly rely on
social platforms for discovery, while authors invest considerable effort in
promoting their work to ensure visibility and citations. To streamline this
process and reduce the reliance on human effort, we introduce Automatic
Promotion (AutoPR), a novel task that transforms research papers into accurate,
engaging, and timely public content. To enable rigorous evaluation, we release
PRBench, a multimodal benchmark that links 512 peer-reviewed articles to
high-quality promotional posts, assessing systems along three axes: Fidelity
(accuracy and tone), Engagement (audience targeting and appeal), and Alignment
(timing and channel optimization). We also introduce PRAgent, a multi-agent
framework that automates AutoPR in three stages: content extraction with
multimodal preparation, collaborative synthesis for polished outputs, and
platform-specific adaptation to optimize norms, tone, and tagging for maximum
reach. When compared to direct LLM pipelines on PRBench, PRAgent demonstrates
substantial improvements, including a 604% increase in total watch time, a 438%
rise in likes, and at least a 2.9x boost in overall engagement. Ablation
studies show that platform modeling and targeted promotion contribute the most
to these gains. Our results position AutoPR as a tractable, measurable research

Conclusion: MPS有效弥合了高质量推理与实时交互之间的差距，在保持推理完整性的同时大幅降低延迟

Abstract: Real-time Spoken Language Models (SLMs) struggle to leverage Chain-of-Thought
(CoT) reasoning due to the prohibitive latency of generating the entire thought
process sequentially. Enabling SLMs to think while speaking, similar to humans,
is attracting increasing attention. We present, for the first time, Mind-Paced
Speaking (MPS), a brain-inspired framework that enables high-fidelity,
real-time reasoning. Similar to how humans utilize distinct brain regions for
thinking and responding, we propose a novel dual-brain approach, employing a
"Formulation Brain" for high-level reasoning to pace and guide a separate
"Articulation Brain" for fluent speech generation. This division of labor
eliminates mode-switching, preserving the integrity of the reasoning process.
Experiments show that MPS significantly outperforms existing
think-while-speaking methods and achieves reasoning performance comparable to
models that pre-compute the full CoT before speaking, while drastically
reducing latency. Under a zero-latency configuration, the proposed method
achieves an accuracy of 92.8% on the mathematical reasoning task Spoken-MQA and
attains a score of 82.5 on the speech conversation task URO-Bench. Our work
effectively bridges the gap between high-quality reasoning and real-time
interaction.

introduce Prompting Test-Time Scaling (P-TTS), a simple yet effective
inference-time data augmentation strategy for enhancing LLM reasoning through
finetuning. Rather than collecting thousands or even millions of examples,
P-TTS leverages a small pool of only 90 manually selected reasoning instances
and systematically varies exemplar augmentation through principled instruction
prompting intensities at test time to synthesize diverse reasoning trajectory
contexts. Then we finetune the various sizes of Qwen-2.5 models on P-TTS data.
Across a suite of mathematical reasoning AIME2024 & 25, MATH500, and
GPQA-Diamond, our P-TTS-7B and 32B models outperform the prior competitive
baselines like S1 and S1.1 (1K-shot), achieving absolute accuracy gains of
+26.66% and +30.00% on AIME'24 (7B), and +13.34% and +6.67% on AIME'25 (7B);
P-TTS-32B yields gains of +23.33% and +16.63% on AIME'24, and +26.63% and
+3.33% on AIME'25 (vs. S1 and S1.1, respectively), with comparable or better
performance on MATH500 and GPQA-Diamond. We further show that P-TTS enhances
zero-shot generalization accuracy on out-of-domain reasoning benchmarks of
Gaokao, Kaoyan, OlympiadBench, AMC23, GradeSchoolMath, and Minerva. Our
analysis suggests that test-time scaling effectively explores the latent space
of reasoning patterns, amplifying LLM problem-solving with minimal annotation
overhead, and further unlocking the reasoning potential and capabilities of
LLMs. Prompting Test-Time Scaling offers a practical, low-cost way to elicit
LLM reasoning in resource-constrained or rapidly evolving domains.

### [203] [Hypothesis Hunting with Evolving Networks of Autonomous Scientific Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08619)
*Tennison Liu,Silas Ruhrberg Estévez,David L. Bentley,Mihaela van der Schaar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了AScience框架和ASCollab系统，使用LLM研究代理进行大规模科学发现，通过社会网络动态积累高质量、多样化和新颖的研究成果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模科学数据集为无特定研究问题的探索性发现提供了机会，但传统方法难以有效处理这种假设搜索过程。

Method: 构建AScience框架，将发现建模为代理、网络和评估规范的交互，实现ASCollab分布式系统，包含具有异质行为的LLM研究代理，这些代理自组织成演化网络，持续产生和同行评审发现。

Result: 实验显示社会动态能够沿多样性-质量-新颖性前沿积累专家评级结果，包括重新发现已建立的生物标志物、扩展已知通路和提出新的治疗靶点。

Conclusion: 虽然湿实验室验证仍然不可或缺，但在癌症队列上的实验表明，社会结构化的代理网络可以大规模持续进行探索性假设搜索。

Abstract: Large-scale scientific datasets -- spanning health biobanks, cell atlases,
Earth reanalyses, and more -- create opportunities for exploratory discovery
unconstrained by specific research questions. We term this process hypothesis
hunting: the cumulative search for insight through sustained exploration across
vast and complex hypothesis spaces. To support it, we introduce AScience, a
framework modeling discovery as the interaction of agents, networks, and
evaluation norms, and implement it as ASCollab, a distributed system of
LLM-based research agents with heterogeneous behaviors. These agents
self-organize into evolving networks, continually producing and peer-reviewing
findings under shared standards of evaluation. Experiments show that such
social dynamics enable the accumulation of expert-rated results along the
diversity-quality-novelty frontier, including rediscoveries of established
biomarkers, extensions of known pathways, and proposals of new therapeutic
targets. While wet-lab validation remains indispensable, our experiments on
cancer cohorts demonstrate that socially structured, agentic networks can
sustain exploratory hypothesis hunting at scale.

### [204] [Optimizing delivery for quick commerce factoring qualitative assessment of generated routes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08671)
*Milon Bhattacharya,Milan Kumar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出使用大语言模型来评估车辆路径规划生成的配送路线，通过策略标准来识别路线问题，提高印度最后一公里物流的效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 印度电商市场快速增长，最后一公里配送占运营成本近一半。传统VRP求解器在真实场景中因地址不规范、地图不完整和计算限制而效果有限。

Method: 开发了一个框架，使用大语言模型基于策略标准来批判VRP生成的路线，让物流运营商能够评估和优先选择更高效的配送计划。生成了400个案例进行标注和评估。

Result: 开源大语言模型识别路线问题的准确率达到79%，专有推理模型最高达到86%。证明基于大语言模型的VRP路线评估是有效且可扩展的评估层。

Conclusion: 大语言模型评估VRP路线超越了传统的距离和时间指标，有助于提高成本效率、配送可靠性和可持续性，特别适用于印度等发展中国家。

Abstract: Indias e-commerce market is projected to grow rapidly, with last-mile
delivery accounting for nearly half of operational expenses. Although vehicle
routing problem (VRP) based solvers are widely used for delivery planning,
their effectiveness in real-world scenarios is limited due to unstructured
addresses, incomplete maps, and computational constraints in distance
estimation. This study proposes a framework that employs large language models
(LLMs) to critique VRP-generated routes against policy-based criteria, allowing
logistics operators to evaluate and prioritise more efficient delivery plans.
As a illustration of our approach we generate, annotate and evaluated 400 cases
using large language models. Our study found that open-source LLMs identified
routing issues with 79% accuracy, while proprietary reasoning models achieved
reach upto 86%. The results demonstrate that LLM-based evaluation of
VRP-generated routes can be an effective and scalable layer of evaluation which
goes beyond beyond conventional distance and time based metrics. This has
implications for improving cost efficiency, delivery reliability, and
sustainability in last-mile logistics, especially for developing countries like
India.

*Yifei Dong,Fengyi Wu,Guangyu Chen,Zhi-Qi Cheng,Qiyu Hu,Yuxuan Zhou,Jingdong Sun,Jun-Yan He,Qi Dai,Alexander G Hauptmann*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了UniWM，一个统一的内存增强世界模型，将自我中心视觉预见和规划集成到单一多模态自回归主干中，显著提升了视觉导航性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前模块化架构将导航规划与视觉世界建模分离，导致状态-动作不对齐，在动态或新场景中适应性有限。需要统一框架来确保预测与控制之间的紧密对齐。

Method: 采用统一的多模态自回归主干，集成视觉预见和规划，使用分层内存机制结合短期感知线索和长期轨迹上下文，实现稳定、连贯的推理。

Result: 在四个挑战性基准测试中，导航成功率提升高达30%，轨迹误差显著减少，在未见过的TartanDrive数据集上表现出优异的零样本泛化能力。

Conclusion: UniWM是实现统一、想象力驱动的具身导航的原则性步骤，通过视觉想象的行动决策确保了预测与控制的紧密对齐。

Abstract: Enabling embodied agents to effectively imagine future states is critical for
robust and generalizable visual navigation. Current state-of-the-art
approaches, however, adopt modular architectures that separate navigation
planning from visual world modeling, leading to state-action misalignment and
limited adaptability in novel or dynamic scenarios. To overcome this
fundamental limitation, we propose UniWM, a unified, memory-augmented world
model integrating egocentric visual foresight and planning within a single
multimodal autoregressive backbone. Unlike modular frameworks, UniWM explicitly
grounds action decisions in visually imagined outcomes, ensuring tight
alignment between prediction and control. A hierarchical memory mechanism
further integrates detailed short-term perceptual cues with longer-term
trajectory context, enabling stable, coherent reasoning over extended horizons.
Extensive experiments across four challenging benchmarks (Go Stanford, ReCon,
SCAND, HuRoN) demonstrate that UniWM substantially improves navigation success
rates by up to 30%, significantly reduces trajectory errors compared to strong
baselines, and exhibits impressive zero-shot generalization on the unseen
TartanDrive dataset. These results highlight UniWM as a principled step toward
unified, imagination-driven embodied navigation.

*Pantea Karimi,Dany Rouhana,Pooria Namyar,Siva Kesava Reddy Kakarla,Venkat Arun,Behnaz Arzani*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 通过向LLM提供启发式算法表现不佳的实例、解释原因并进行输入空间区域专门化设计，可以生成比现有技术更鲁棒的启发式算法，最坏情况性能提升约28倍，平均性能也得到改善，同时保持运行时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有使用LLM设计启发式算法的方法缺乏对算法表现不佳原因的解释和针对性改进，导致生成的启发式算法鲁棒性不足。

Method: 提出三个简单但有效的策略：(1)向LLM展示启发式算法表现不佳的实例；(2)解释这些表现不佳的原因；(3)针对输入空间的不同区域进行专门化设计。

Result: 生成的启发式算法相比FunSearch具有约28倍更好的最坏情况性能，平均性能得到提升，同时保持运行时间不变。

Conclusion: 通过向LLM提供失败案例分析和针对性改进建议，可以显著提升启发式算法的鲁棒性和性能表现。

Abstract: We posit that we can generate more robust and performant heuristics if we
augment approaches using LLMs for heuristic design with tools that explain why
heuristics underperform and suggestions about how to fix them. We find even
simple ideas that (1) expose the LLM to instances where the heuristic
underperforms; (2) explain why they occur; and (3) specialize design to regions
in the input space, can produce more robust algorithms compared to existing
techniques~ -- ~the heuristics we produce have a $\sim28\times$ better
worst-case performance compared to FunSearch, improve average performance, and
maintain the runtime.

### [207] [GTAlign: Game-Theoretic Alignment of LLM Assistants for Mutual Welfare](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08872)
*Siqi Zhu,David Zhang,Pedro Cisneros-Velarde,Jiaxuan You*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出GTAlign框架，将博弈论决策整合到LLM的推理和训练中，通过构建收益矩阵来优化用户与模型之间的互动，实现互利共赢。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统对齐方法假设最大化模型奖励就能最大化用户福利，但实践中模型可能过度澄清或生成冗长推理，而用户偏好简洁答案，这种个体理性选择导致社会次优结果。

Method: 在推理阶段将用户-LLM交互视为战略博弈，构建收益矩阵评估双方福利；在训练阶段引入互利奖励强化合作响应；还提出基于博弈论推理的动态适应技术。

Result: 大量实验表明GTAlign在多样化任务中显著提升推理效率、答案质量和互利福利。

Conclusion: GTAlign通过博弈论方法有效解决了LLM对齐中的社会效率问题，实现了用户与模型的双赢。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in reasoning,
yet sometimes produce responses that are suboptimal for users in tasks such as
writing, information seeking, or providing practical guidance. Conventional
alignment practices typically assume that maximizing model reward also
maximizes user welfare, but this assumption frequently fails in practice:
models may over-clarify or generate overly verbose reasoning when users prefer
concise answers. Such behaviors resemble the prisoner's dilemma, where
individually rational choices lead to socially suboptimal outcomes. The
fundamental challenge is the lack of a principled decision making mechanism
that mutually benefits both the LLM and the user. We propose Game-Theoretic
Alignment (GTAlign), an alignment framework that integrates game-theoretic
decision making into both reasoning and training. During reasoning, the model
explicitly treats user-LLM interaction as a strategic game: it constructs
payoff matrices within its reasoning chain to estimate welfare for both itself
and the user, and then selects actions that are mutually beneficial. During
training, we introduce a mutual welfare reward that reinforces cooperative
responses, aligning model behavior with socially efficient outcomes. In
addition, we introduce an inference technique that leverages game-theoretic
reasoning to dynamically adapt LLM's response when pricing policies of LLM
service change. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GTAlign substantially
improves reasoning efficiency, answer quality, and mutual welfare compared to
baselines across diverse tasks. The code is available at

### [208] [COMPASS: Enhancing Agent Long-Horizon Reasoning with Evolving Context](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08790)
*Guangya Wan,Mingyang Ling,Xiaoqi Ren,Rujun Han,Sheng Li,Zizhao Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: COMPASS是一个轻量级分层框架，通过将战术执行、战略监督和上下文管理分离为三个专门组件，解决了LLM代理在长时程任务中的上下文管理瓶颈问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长时程任务需要持续推理和多次工具交互，这对LLM代理具有挑战性：小错误会在步骤间累积，即使最先进的模型也经常产生幻觉或失去连贯性。上下文管理被识别为核心瓶颈——过长的历史会导致代理忽视关键证据或被无关信息分散注意力。

Method: COMPASS框架包含三个专门组件：(1)主代理执行推理和工具使用，(2)元思考者监控进展并发出战略干预，(3)上下文管理器为不同推理阶段维护简洁相关的进展简报。

Result: 在GAIA、BrowseComp和Humanity's Last Exam三个具有挑战性的基准测试中，COMPASS相比单代理和多代理基线将准确率提高了高达20%。

Conclusion: COMPASS通过分层专业化方法有效解决了LLM代理在长时程任务中的上下文管理问题，显著提升了性能，并可通过测试时扩展和后训练流水线进一步优化效率。

Abstract: Long-horizon tasks that require sustained reasoning and multiple tool
interactions remain challenging for LLM agents: small errors compound across
steps, and even state-of-the-art models often hallucinate or lose coherence. We
identify context management as the central bottleneck -- extended histories
cause agents to overlook critical evidence or become distracted by irrelevant
information, thus failing to replan or reflect from previous mistakes. To
address this, we propose COMPASS (Context-Organized Multi-Agent Planning and
Strategy System), a lightweight hierarchical framework that separates tactical
execution, strategic oversight, and context organization into three specialized
components: (1) a Main Agent that performs reasoning and tool use, (2) a
Meta-Thinker that monitors progress and issues strategic interventions, and (3)
a Context Manager that maintains concise, relevant progress briefs for
different reasoning stages. Across three challenging benchmarks -- GAIA,
BrowseComp, and Humanity's Last Exam -- COMPASS improves accuracy by up to 20%
relative to both single- and multi-agent baselines. We further introduce a
test-time scaling extension that elevates performance to match established
DeepResearch agents, and a post-training pipeline that delegates context
management to smaller models for enhanced efficiency.

### [209] [Everyone prefers human writers, including AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08831)
*Wouter Haverals,Meredith Martin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究发现人类和AI评估者在文学风格评价中都存在系统性的人类偏好偏见，AI模型的偏见程度是人类的两倍多，且这种偏见在不同AI架构间普遍存在。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI写作工具的普及，需要了解人类和机器如何评估文学风格这一主观领域，特别是评估者是否存在归因偏见。

Method: 使用Raymond Queneau的《风格练习》进行对照实验：研究1比较人类参与者(N=556)和AI模型(N=13)在盲测、准确标注和反事实标注三种条件下评估文学段落；研究2测试偏见在14×14矩阵的AI评估者和创作者间的普遍性。

Result: 人类显示+13.7个百分点的偏见(Cohen's h=0.28)，AI模型显示+34.3个百分点的偏见(h=0.70)，是人类的2.5倍(P<0.001)。研究2确认这种偏见在不同AI架构间普遍存在(+25.8pp)。归因标签导致评估者颠倒评估标准，相同特征仅因感知作者身份而获得相反评价。

Conclusion: AI模型在训练过程中吸收了人类对人工创造力的文化偏见，不仅复制而且放大了人类的这种偏见倾向。这是首次在审美判断中对人类和人工评估者的归因偏见进行对照比较。

Abstract: As AI writing tools become widespread, we need to understand how both humans
and machines evaluate literary style, a domain where objective standards are
elusive and judgments are inherently subjective. We conducted controlled
experiments using Raymond Queneau's Exercises in Style (1947) to measure
attribution bias across evaluators. Study 1 compared human participants (N=556)
and AI models (N=13) evaluating literary passages from Queneau versus
GPT-4-generated versions under three conditions: blind, accurately labeled, and
counterfactually labeled. Study 2 tested bias generalization across a
14$\times$14 matrix of AI evaluators and creators. Both studies revealed
systematic pro-human attribution bias. Humans showed +13.7 percentage point
(pp) bias (Cohen's h = 0.28, 95% CI: 0.21-0.34), while AI models showed +34.3
percentage point bias (h = 0.70, 95% CI: 0.65-0.76), a 2.5-fold stronger effect
(P$<$0.001). Study 2 confirmed this bias operates across AI architectures
(+25.8pp, 95% CI: 24.1-27.6%), demonstrating that AI systems systematically
devalue creative content when labeled as "AI-generated" regardless of which AI
created it. We also find that attribution labels cause evaluators to invert
assessment criteria, with identical features receiving opposing evaluations
based solely on perceived authorship. This suggests AI models have absorbed
human cultural biases against artificial creativity during training. Our study
represents the first controlled comparison of attribution bias between human
and artificial evaluators in aesthetic judgment, revealing that AI systems not
only replicate but amplify this human tendency.

*Allison Sihan Jia,Daniel Huang,Nikhil Vytla,Nirvika Choudhury,John C Mitchell,Anupam Datta*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了Agent GPA（目标-计划-行动）评估框架，包含5个评估指标，能系统性地覆盖广泛的智能体失败情况，在基准数据集上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 需要一个系统化的评估范式来评估智能体在目标设定、计划制定和行动执行方面的表现，并准确定位失败原因。

Method: 基于智能体操作循环的GPA框架，包含目标实现、逻辑一致性、执行效率、计划质量和计划遵循五个评估指标，使用LLM作为评估器。

Result: 在两个基准数据集上的实验表明，该框架能覆盖所有智能体错误，LLM评估与人工标注高度一致（80-95%），错误定位准确率达86%。

Conclusion: Agent GPA框架为智能体评估提供了系统化方法，能有效识别和定位失败，支持智能体性能的针对性改进。

Abstract: We introduce the Agent GPA (Goal-Plan-Action) framework: an evaluation
paradigm based on an agent's operational loop of setting goals, devising plans,
and executing actions. The framework includes five evaluation metrics: Goal
Fulfillment, Logical Consistency, Execution Efficiency, Plan Quality, and Plan
Adherence. Logical Consistency checks that an agent's actions are consistent
with its prior actions. Execution Efficiency checks whether the agent executes
in the most efficient way to achieve its goal. Plan Quality checks whether an
agent's plans are aligned with its goals; Plan Adherence checks if an agent's
actions are aligned with its plan; and Goal Fulfillment checks that agent's
final outcomes match the stated goals. Our experimental results on two
benchmark datasets - the public TRAIL/GAIA dataset and an internal dataset for
a production-grade data agent - show that this framework (a) provides a
systematic way to cover a broad range of agent failures, including all agent
errors on the TRAIL/GAIA benchmark dataset; (b) supports LLM-judges that
exhibit strong agreement with human annotation, covering 80% to over 95%
errors; and (c) localizes errors with 86% agreement to enable targeted
improvement of agent performance.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ReviewerToo是一个模块化AI辅助同行评审框架，在ICLR 2025数据集上达到81.8%的接收/拒绝分类准确率，接近人类评审员的83.9%。AI评审在事实核查和文献覆盖方面表现出色，但在评估方法新颖性和理论贡献方面仍有不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统同行评审存在的不一致性、评审员主观性和可扩展性挑战，通过AI辅助评审来补充人类判断，提供系统化和一致的评估。

Method: 开发了ReviewerToo模块化框架，支持专门的评审员角色和结构化评估标准，可以部分或完全集成到真实会议工作流程中。使用gpt-oss-120b模型在ICLR 2025的1,963篇论文提交上进行验证。

Result: AI评审员在接收/拒绝分类任务上达到81.8%准确率，接近人类平均83.9%；AI生成的评审在质量上优于人类平均水平，但仍落后于最强专家评审。AI在事实核查和文献覆盖方面表现优异，但在评估方法新颖性和理论贡献方面存在困难。

Conclusion: AI可以增强同行评审的一致性、覆盖范围和公平性，但复杂的评估判断仍需领域专家。提出了将AI整合到同行评审流程的指导原则，为构建系统化混合同行评审系统奠定基础。

Abstract: Peer review is the cornerstone of scientific publishing, yet it suffers from
inconsistencies, reviewer subjectivity, and scalability challenges. We
introduce ReviewerToo, a modular framework for studying and deploying
AI-assisted peer review to complement human judgment with systematic and
consistent assessments. ReviewerToo supports systematic experiments with
specialized reviewer personas and structured evaluation criteria, and can be
partially or fully integrated into real conference workflows. We validate
ReviewerToo on a carefully curated dataset of 1,963 paper submissions from ICLR
2025, where our experiments with the gpt-oss-120b model achieves 81.8% accuracy
for the task of categorizing a paper as accept/reject compared to 83.9% for the
average human reviewer. Additionally, ReviewerToo-generated reviews are rated
as higher quality than the human average by an LLM judge, though still trailing
the strongest expert contributions. Our analysis highlights domains where AI
reviewers excel (e.g., fact-checking, literature coverage) and where they
struggle (e.g., assessing methodological novelty and theoretical
contributions), underscoring the continued need for human expertise. Based on
these findings, we propose guidelines for integrating AI into peer-review
pipelines, showing how AI can enhance consistency, coverage, and fairness while
leaving complex evaluative judgments to domain experts. Our work provides a
foundation for systematic, hybrid peer-review systems that scale with the
growth of scientific publishing.

*Zirui Liao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: EcphoryRAG是一个基于认知神经科学启发的实体中心知识图谱RAG框架，通过提取核心实体和元数据实现轻量级索引，相比其他结构化RAG系统减少94%的token消耗，并通过多跳关联搜索和动态关系推理实现复杂问答。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受人类利用线索激活实体中心记忆痕迹进行复杂多跳回忆的认知神经科学机制启发，旨在开发更高效的复杂问答系统。

Method: 在索引阶段仅提取和存储核心实体及元数据；检索时先提取查询中的线索实体，然后在知识图谱上进行可扩展的多跳关联搜索，动态推断实体间的隐式关系来填充上下文。

Result: 在2WikiMultiHop、HotpotQA和MuSiQue基准测试中达到新的最先进水平，将平均精确匹配(EM)分数从0.392提升到0.474，优于HippoRAG等强KG-RAG方法。

Conclusion: 实体-线索-多跳检索范式对于复杂问答任务具有显著有效性，验证了该方法的优越性能。

Abstract: Cognitive neuroscience research indicates that humans leverage cues to
activate entity-centered memory traces (engrams) for complex, multi-hop
recollection. Inspired by this mechanism, we introduce EcphoryRAG, an
entity-centric knowledge graph RAG framework. During indexing, EcphoryRAG
extracts and stores only core entities with corresponding metadata, a
lightweight approach that reduces token consumption by up to 94\% compared to
other structured RAG systems. For retrieval, the system first extracts cue
entities from queries, then performs a scalable multi-hop associative search
across the knowledge graph. Crucially, EcphoryRAG dynamically infers implicit
relations between entities to populate context, enabling deep reasoning without
exhaustive pre-enumeration of relationships. Extensive evaluations on the
2WikiMultiHop, HotpotQA, and MuSiQue benchmarks demonstrate that EcphoryRAG
sets a new state-of-the-art, improving the average Exact Match (EM) score from
0.392 to 0.474 over strong KG-RAG methods like HippoRAG. These results validate
the efficacy of the entity-cue-multi-hop retrieval paradigm for complex
question answering.

TL;DR: 提出了LM Fight Arena框架，通过在格斗游戏《真人快打II》中让大型多模态模型相互对战，评估其在实时对抗环境中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大型多模态模型基准测试往往无法捕捉其在实时对抗环境中的真实性能，需要一种动态、交互式的评估方法。

Method: 构建了一个自动化对战框架，让6个领先的开源和闭源模型在《真人快打II》游戏中控制相同角色进行对战，通过解读游戏画面和状态数据来选择行动。

Result: 提供了一个完全自动化、可复现且客观的评估方法，能够测试LMM在动态环境中的战略推理能力。

Conclusion: LM Fight Arena是一个具有挑战性和趣味性的基准测试，弥合了AI评估与交互娱乐之间的差距。

Abstract: Existing benchmarks for large multimodal models (LMMs) often fail to capture
their performance in real-time, adversarial environments. We introduce LM Fight
Arena (Large Model Fight Arena), a novel framework that evaluates LMMs by
pitting them against each other in the classic fighting game Mortal Kombat II,
a task requiring rapid visual understanding and tactical, sequential
decision-making. In a controlled tournament, we test six leading open- and
closed-source models, where each agent operates controlling the same character
to ensure a fair comparison. The models are prompted to interpret game frames
and state data to select their next actions. Unlike static evaluations, LM
Fight Arena provides a fully automated, reproducible, and objective assessment
of an LMM's strategic reasoning capabilities in a dynamic setting. This work
introduces a challenging and engaging benchmark that bridges the gap between AI
evaluation and interactive entertainment.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RADAR是一个基于机制可解释性的框架，通过区分基于记忆和基于推理的模型响应来检测数据污染问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数据污染导致LLM评估不可靠，模型可能通过记忆训练数据而非真正推理来获得高分。

Method: 提取37个特征，包括表面置信度轨迹和深层机制特性（注意力专业化、电路动态、激活流模式），使用集成分类器进行检测。

Result: 在多样化评估集上达到93%准确率，清晰案例完美表现，挑战性模糊案例76.7%准确率。

Conclusion: 机制可解释性有潜力推动LLM评估超越传统表面指标。

Abstract: Data contamination poses a significant challenge to reliable LLM evaluation,
where models may achieve high performance by memorizing training data rather
than demonstrating genuine reasoning capabilities. We introduce RADAR (Recall
vs. Reasoning Detection through Activation Representation), a novel framework
that leverages mechanistic interpretability to detect contamination by
distinguishing recall-based from reasoning-based model responses. RADAR
extracts 37 features spanning surface-level confidence trajectories and deep
mechanistic properties including attention specialization, circuit dynamics,
and activation flow patterns. Using an ensemble of classifiers trained on these
features, RADAR achieves 93\% accuracy on a diverse evaluation set, with
perfect performance on clear cases and 76.7\% accuracy on challenging ambiguous
examples. This work demonstrates the potential of mechanistic interpretability
for advancing LLM evaluation beyond traditional surface-level metrics.

Motivation: 现有基准主要关注检索等特定方面，缺乏对RAG管道整体能力的评估，特别是在多模态信息处理方面的表现。

Method: 创建包含93个问题的数据集评估文本、表格、图像等多模态信息处理能力；提出短语级召回指标；使用最近邻嵌入分类器检测幻觉；比较开源和闭源管道的性能。

Result: 闭源管道在正确性和幻觉检测方面显著优于开源管道，特别是在多模态和跨文档问题上表现差距更大；人类评估显示正确性指标平均同意度为4.62，幻觉检测为4.53（5分制）。

Conclusion: 该基准有效评估RAG管道的整体性能，闭源模型在多模态信息处理方面表现更优，提出的评估指标与人类判断具有良好一致性。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has emerged as a promising paradigm for
improving factual accuracy in large language models (LLMs). We introduce a
benchmark designed to evaluate RAG pipelines as a whole, evaluating a
pipeline's ability to ingest, retrieve, and reason about several modalities of
information, differentiating it from existing benchmarks that focus on
particular aspects such as retrieval. We present (1) a small, human-created
dataset of 93 questions designed to evaluate a pipeline's ability to ingest
textual data, tables, images, and data spread across these modalities in one or
more documents; (2) a phrase-level recall metric for correctness; (3) a
nearest-neighbor embedding classifier to identify potential pipeline
hallucinations; (4) a comparative evaluation of 2 pipelines built with
open-source retrieval mechanisms and 4 closed-source foundation models; and (5)
a third-party human evaluation of the alignment of our correctness and

outperform open-source pipelines in both correctness and hallucination metrics,
with wider performance gaps in questions relying on multimodal and

agreement of 4.62 for correctness and 4.53 for hallucination detection on a 1-5

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DualResearch是一个检索和融合框架，通过联合建模广度语义图和深度因果图来解决深度研究框架中的上下文污染、证据支持薄弱和执行路径脆弱问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度研究框架虽然能协调外部工具进行复杂科学推理，但仍存在上下文污染、证据支持薄弱和执行路径脆弱等局限。

Method: 提出DualResearch框架，联合建模两个互补图：广度语义图编码稳定背景知识，深度因果图捕获执行来源。使用语义扩散和因果语义路径匹配，并通过熵门控规则融合答案分布。

Result: 在科学推理基准HLE和GPQA上表现优异，使用InternAgent日志文件时，HLE准确率提升7.7%，GPQA提升6.06%。

Conclusion: DualResearch能有效压缩多工具执行日志为简洁推理图，稳定重构答案，作为深度研究系统的补充表现出色。

Abstract: The deep-research framework orchestrates external tools to perform complex,
multi-step scientific reasoning that exceeds the native limits of a single
large language model. However, it still suffers from context pollution, weak
evidentiary support, and brittle execution paths. To address these issues, we
propose DualResearch, a retrieval and fusion framework that matches the
epistemic structure of tool-intensive reasoning by jointly modeling two
complementary graphs: a breadth semantic graph that encodes stable background
knowledge, and a depth causal graph that captures execution provenance. Each
graph has a layer-native relevance function, seed-anchored semantic diffusion
for breadth, and causal-semantic path matching with reliability weighting for
depth. To reconcile their heterogeneity and query-dependent uncertainty,
DualResearch converts per-layer path evidence into answer distributions and
fuses them in log space via an entropy-gated rule with global calibration. The
fusion up-weights the more certain channel and amplifies agreement. As a
complement to deep-research systems, DualResearch compresses lengthy multi-tool
execution logs into a concise reasoning graph, and we show that it can
reconstruct answers stably and effectively. On the scientific reasoning
benchmarks HLE and GPQA, DualResearch achieves competitive performance. Using
log files from the open-source system InternAgent, its accuracy improves by
7.7% on HLE and 6.06% on GPQA.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出Semantic-condition Tuning (SCT)新范式，通过图神经网络提取语义条件并自适应融合文本嵌入，显著优于前缀调优方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有前缀调优方法简单拼接知识嵌入与文本输入，忽略了知识图谱的丰富关系语义，给LLM带来隐式推理负担

Method: SCT包含两个模块：语义图模块使用GNN从局部图邻域提取上下文感知语义条件；条件自适应融合模块通过参数化投影器自适应调节文本嵌入

Result: 在知识图谱基准测试中，SCT显著优于前缀调优和其他强基线方法

Conclusion: 通过在LLM推理前用语义图上下文调节输入表示，SCT提供了更直接有效的信号，实现了更准确鲁棒的知识推理

Abstract: Fusing Knowledge Graphs with Large Language Models is crucial for
knowledge-intensive tasks like knowledge graph completion. The prevailing
paradigm, prefix-tuning, simply concatenates knowledge embeddings with text
inputs. However, this shallow fusion overlooks the rich relational semantics
within KGs and imposes a significant implicit reasoning burden on the LLM to
correlate the prefix with the text. To address these, we propose
Semantic-condition Tuning (SCT), a new knowledge injection paradigm comprising
two key modules. First, a Semantic Graph Module employs a Graph Neural Network
to extract a context-aware semantic condition from the local graph
neighborhood, guided by knowledge-enhanced relations. Subsequently, this
condition is passed to a Condition-Adaptive Fusion Module, which, in turn,
adaptively modulates the textual embedding via two parameterized projectors,
enabling a deep, feature-wise, and knowledge-aware interaction. The resulting
pre-fused embedding is then fed into the LLM for fine-tuning. Extensive
experiments on knowledge graph benchmarks demonstrate that SCT significantly
outperforms prefix-tuning and other strong baselines. Our analysis confirms
that by modulating the input representation with semantic graph context before
LLM inference, SCT provides a more direct and potent signal, enabling more
accurate and robust knowledge reasoning.

TL;DR: Tiny-R1V是一个轻量级3B参数的多模态大语言模型，通过两阶段优化实现更快推理和更高准确率，统一了多任务多模态推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLMs在推理效率上面临模型尺寸大、过度思考、轻量场景准确率低等挑战，而轻量级MLLMs的推理能力研究较为缺乏。

Method: 采用两阶段优化：第一阶段引入LIPO强化学习方法，动态调整响应优势，鼓励生成更短更准确的响应；第二阶段提出AMM模型融合方法，自适应调整任务向量权重并通过梯度投影正则化优化合并向量。

Result: 在十个广泛使用的推理基准测试（数学、结构化数据、OCR和通用能力）上表现出优越性能，使轻量模型在多样化多模态推理任务中表现出色。

Conclusion: Tiny-R1V通过创新的两阶段优化方法，成功解决了轻量级MLLMs的推理效率问题，为轻量模型在多模态推理任务中的应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Although Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated
remarkable capabilities across diverse tasks, they encounter numerous
challenges in terms of reasoning efficiency, such as large model size,
overthinking, and compromised accuracy in lightweight scenarios. However,
research on the reasoning capabilities of lightweight MLLMs is quite lacking.
To this end, we propose Tiny-R1V, a novel lightweight 3B model that achieves
faster inference and higher accuracy via a two-stage optimization, while
unifying multimodal reasoning across multiple tasks and using fewer tokens. In
the first stage, Tiny-R1V introduces Length-Informed Relative Policy
Optimization (LIPO), a novel reinforcement learning method, to train each
reasoning model. The LIPO is designed to dynamically adjusts advantages of
responses within groups, that is, by prioritizing concise yet high-quality
responses to encourage the generation of shorter and more accurate response. In
the second stage, we propose Adaptive Model Merging (AMM), a training-free
model merging method that merges multiple specialist models into a unified
architecture. Specifically, AMM adaptively adjusts the weights of task vectors
and robustly optimizes the merged vectors via a novel gradient projection
regularization loss function, thus mitigating redundant conflicts between them.
Extensive evaluations on ten widely-used reasoning benchmarks covering
mathematics, structured data (charts, tables, documents), OCR, and general
capabilities showcase the superior performance of Tiny-R1V, enabling
lightweight models to excel in diverse multimodal reasoning tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准在评估LLMs旅行规划能力时，往往无法充分评估计划的可行性、可靠性和吸引力，需要更全面的评估框架。

Method: 构建包含4,870个查询的大规模数据集，开发统一奖励评估器，通过测试时计算、神经符号方法、监督微调和GRPO强化学习等多种方法进行实验。

Result: 评估器与旅行专家注释达到60.75%的一致性，优于多个LLM-as-judge基线；RL方法普遍提高了行程可行性，获得更高的统一奖励分数。

Conclusion: 提出的基准能够有效评估旅行规划质量，RL方法在提升计划可行性方面表现出色，为旅行规划研究提供了有价值的工具。

Abstract: Travel planning is a valuable yet complex task that poses significant
challenges even for advanced large language models (LLMs). While recent
benchmarks have advanced in evaluating LLMs' planning capabilities, they often
fall short in evaluating feasibility, reliability, and engagement of travel
plans. We introduce a comprehensive benchmark for travel planning that unifies
fine-grained criteria into a single reward, enabling direct comparison of plan
quality and seamless integration with reinforcement learning (RL). Our
evaluator achieves moderate agreement with travel-expert annotations (60.75\%)
and outperforms multiple LLM-as-judge baselines. We further release a
large-scale dataset of 4,870 queries including 219 real-world, free-form
requests for generalization to authentic user intent. Using this benchmark, we
conduct extensive experiments across diverse methods and LLMs, including
test-time computation, neuro-symbolic approaches, supervised fine-tuning, and
RL via GRPO. Across base models, RL generally improves itinerary feasibility
over prompt-only and supervised baselines, yielding higher unified reward
scores.

TL;DR: 该论文评估了SOTA LLMs在评分证明方面的能力，发现模型能可靠标记错误解但部分评分存在校准差距，为此提出了基于代理工作流程的多步骤评分方法，显著提高了与人工评分的一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着SOTA LLMs在奥林匹克数学问题上取得显著进展（能解决IMO 2025的大部分问题），需要评估这些模型在评分证明方面的能力，包括检测错误、判断严重程度以及分配公平分数。

Method: 使用90个Gemini 2.5 Pro生成的解（按1-4分制评分）和MathArena的IMO/USAMO 2025解集（0-7分制）进行分析，引入代理工作流程提取参考解并自动推导问题特定评分标准，进行多步骤评分过程。

Result: 模型能可靠标记错误解（包括微妙错误），但在分配部分分数时存在校准差距。提出的工作流程在注释语料库和MathArena上都实现了与人工评分更高的一致性，并在处理部分分数时更加一致。

Conclusion: 代理工作流程能有效改善LLMs的证明评分能力，特别是在处理部分分数方面，为未来研究提供了代码、数据和提示/日志资源。

Abstract: State-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs have progressed from struggling on proof-based
Olympiad problems to solving most of the IMO 2025 problems, with leading
systems reportedly handling 5 of 6 problems. Given this progress, we assess how
well these models can grade proofs: detecting errors, judging their severity,
and assigning fair scores beyond binary correctness. We study proof-analysis
capabilities using a corpus of 90 Gemini 2.5 Pro-generated solutions that we
grade on a 1-4 scale with detailed error annotations, and on MathArena solution
sets for IMO/USAMO 2025 scored on a 0-7 scale. Our analysis shows that models
can reliably flag incorrect (including subtly incorrect) solutions but exhibit
calibration gaps in how partial credit is assigned. To address this, we
introduce agentic workflows that extract and analyze reference solutions and
automatically derive problem-specific rubrics for a multi-step grading process.
We instantiate and compare different design choices for the grading workflows,
and evaluate their trade-offs. Across our annotated corpus and MathArena, our
proposed workflows achieve higher agreement with human grades and more
consistent handling of partial credit across metrics. We release all code,
data, and prompts/logs to facilitate future research.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种混合框架LRR来解决正则表达式拒绝服务漏洞修复问题，结合符号化模块和LLM的优势，将问题定位与修复过程解耦，提高修复率15.4%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 正则表达式在现代计算中广泛应用，但其普遍性暴露了系统对ReDoS漏洞的风险。现有方法存在权衡：符号化方法精确但无法修复复杂模式，LLM具有泛化能力但缺乏可靠性。

Method: LRR混合框架：首先使用确定性符号模块定位易受攻击的子模式，然后调用LLM为隔离的片段生成语义等效的修复。

Result: 该架构成功解决了基于规则修复无法处理的复杂修复案例，同时避免了纯LLM方法的语义错误，修复率比最先进方法提高15.4%。

Conclusion: 这项工作为自动化修复提供了经过验证的方法论，通过解耦问题识别和修复过程，结合LLM的泛化能力和符号化方法的可靠性。

Abstract: Regular expressions (regexes) are foundational to modern computing for
critical tasks like input validation and data parsing, yet their ubiquity
exposes systems to regular expression denial of service (ReDoS), a
vulnerability requiring automated repair methods. Current approaches, however,
are hampered by a trade-off. Symbolic, rule-based system are precise but fails
to repair unseen or complex vulnerability patterns. Conversely, large language
models (LLMs) possess the necessary generalizability but are unreliable for
tasks demanding strict syntactic and semantic correctness. We resolve this
impasse by introducing a hybrid framework, localized regex repair (LRR),
designed to harness LLM generalization while enforcing reliability. Our core
insight is to decouple problem identification from the repair process. First, a
deterministic, symbolic module localizes the precise vulnerable subpattern,
creating a constrained and tractable problem space. Then, the LLM invoked to
generate a semantically equivalent fix for this isolated segment. This combined
architecture successfully resolves complex repair cases intractable for
rule-based repair while avoiding the semantic errors of LLM-only approaches.
Our work provides a validated methodology for solving such problems in
automated repair, improving the repair rate by 15.4%p over the
state-of-the-art. Our code is available at https://github.com/cdltlehf/LRR.

TL;DR: 提出了连续记忆机制，将GUI轨迹编码为固定长度的连续嵌入，显著减少上下文成本并保留视觉细节，通过自动扩展数据飞轮收集10万+轨迹，在真实GUI基准测试中提升长任务和分布偏移下的成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GUI代理将历史轨迹压缩为文本标记，导致上下文长度膨胀且丢失关键视觉线索（如控件大小和位置），需要可扩展的记忆机制来提升跨界面和长任务泛化能力。

Method: 使用VLM作为编码器将GUI轨迹编码为固定长度的连续嵌入，直接输入到骨干网络；引入自动扩展数据飞轮，通过搜索发现新环境、VLM合成任务、代理执行轨迹、VLM验证成功来低成本扩展记忆。

Result: 随着记忆大小和检索深度增加，性能单调提升；Qwen-2.5-VL-7B+连续记忆达到与GPT-4o、Claude-4等闭源模型相当的性能；在真实GUI基准测试中显著提升长任务和分布偏移下的成功率。

Conclusion: 连续记忆机制能有效减少上下文成本并保留视觉信息，结合自动扩展数据飞轮可低成本构建大规模记忆库，显著提升GUI代理在复杂任务中的表现。

Abstract: We study how to endow GUI agents with scalable memory that help generalize
across unfamiliar interfaces and long-horizon tasks. Prior GUI agents compress
past trajectories into text tokens, which balloons context length and misses
decisive visual cues (e.g., exact widget size and position). We propose a
continuous memory that encodes each GUI trajectory into a fixed-length sequence
of continuous embeddings using the VLM itself as an encoder; these embeddings
are plugged directly into the backbone's input layer, sharply reducing context
cost while preserving fine-grained visual information. As memory size and
retrieval depth increase, performance improves monotonically, unlike text
memories that degrade with long prompts. To grow memory at low cost, we
introduce an auto-scaling data flywheel that (i) discovers new environments via
search, (ii) synthesizes tasks with an open-source VLM, (iii) rolls out
trajectories with the agent, and (iv) verifies success with the same VLM. Using
this pipeline, we collect 100k+ trajectories for about \$4000 and fine-tune
only the memory encoder (LoRA on a Q-Former, 1.2\% parameters) with 1,500
samples. On real-world GUI benchmarks, our memory-augmented agent consistently
improves success rates under long horizons and distribution shifts. Notably,
Qwen-2.5-VL-7B + continuous memory achieves performance comparable to
state-of-the-art closed-source models (e.g., GPT-4o, Claude-4).

<details>

Motivation: 当前大型语言模型在翻译、摘要等领域取得显著进展，但由于幻觉问题难以模拟人类意识。本研究旨在通过整合精神分析和人格理论来解决这一挑战，构建更直观和适应性强的人工智能系统。

Method: 基于精神分析原理开发三种人工意识（自我意识、无意识、前意识），设计16种MBTI人格类型角色（包含需求、状态、记忆等属性），创建10种不同情境（考虑情感理解、逻辑思维等7个属性），并通过调查评估、ChatGPT三级分类和定性审查三种方式评估决策过程。

Result: 定量和定性分析均表明模型能够很好地模拟人类意识，尽管不同角色和意识之间的响应差异不显著。这表明整合精神分析和人格理论的模型能够构建更直观和适应性强的类人意识AI系统。

Conclusion: 本研究为在复杂认知情境中改进AI交互开辟了新途径，通过整合精神分析和人格理论元素，能够构建具有类人意识的人工智能系统。

Abstract: Human consciousness is still a concept hard to define with current scientific
understanding. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated
significant advancements across various domains including translation and
summarization, human consciousness is not something to imitate with current
upfront technology owing to so-called hallucination. This study, therefore,
proposes a novel approach to address these challenges by integrating
psychoanalysis and the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) into constructing
consciousness and personality modules. We developed three artificial
consciousnesses (self-awareness, unconsciousness, and preconsciousness) based
on the principles of psychoanalysis. Additionally, we designed 16 characters
with different personalities representing the sixteen MBTI types, with several
attributes such as needs, status, and memories. To determine if our model's
artificial consciousness exhibits human-like cognition, we created ten distinct
situations considering seven attributes such as emotional understanding and
logical thinking. The decision-making process of artificial consciousness and
the final action were evaluated in three ways: survey evaluation, three-tier
classification via ChatGPT, and qualitative review. Both quantitative and
qualitative analyses indicated a high likelihood of well-simulated
consciousness, although the difference in response between different characters
and consciousnesses was not very significant. This implies that the developed
models incorporating elements of psychoanalysis and personality theory can lead
to building a more intuitive and adaptable AI system with humanoid
consciousness. Therefore, this study contributes to opening up new avenues for
improving AI interactions in complex cognitive contexts.

TL;DR: 提出MEC³O多专家共识系统，通过将LLM分配到不同复杂度类别并让专家进行结构化辩论，在代码复杂度预测任务中优于开源基线模型和GPT-4o-mini。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM在代码复杂度预测任务中表现不均衡，没有单一模型在所有复杂度类别上都表现优异，需要利用不同模型在不同类别上的优势。

Method: MEC³O系统将LLM基于性能分配到不同复杂度类别，提供类别专用指令使其成为专家，通过结构化辩论和加权共识机制整合预测结果。

Result: 在CodeComplex数据集上，MEC³O比开源基线模型准确率和macro-F1分数至少高出10%，在macro-F1上平均超过GPT-4o-mini，与GPT-4o和GPT-4o-mini在F1分数上表现相当。

Conclusion: 多专家辩论和加权共识策略能有效提升代码复杂度预测性能，证明了该方法在整合不同模型专长方面的有效性。

Abstract: Predicting the complexity of source code is essential for software
development and algorithm analysis. Recently, Baik et al. (2025) introduced
CodeComplex for code time complexity prediction. The paper shows that LLMs
without fine-tuning struggle with certain complexity classes. This suggests
that no single LLM excels at every class, but rather each model shows
advantages in certain classes. We propose MEC$^3$O, a multi-expert consensus
system, which extends the multi-agent debate frameworks. MEC$^3$O assigns LLMs
to complexity classes based on their performance and provides them with
class-specialized instructions, turning them into experts. These experts engage
in structured debates, and their predictions are integrated through a weighted
consensus mechanism. Our expertise assignments to LLMs effectively handle
Degeneration-of-Thought, reducing reliance on a separate judge model, and
preventing convergence to incorrect majority opinions. Experiments on
CodeComplex show that MEC$^3$O outperforms the open-source baselines, achieving
at least 10% higher accuracy and macro-F1 scores. It also surpasses GPT-4o-mini
in macro-F1 scores on average and demonstrates competitive on-par F1 scores to
GPT-4o and GPT-o4-mini on average. This demonstrates the effectiveness of
multi-expert debates and weight consensus strategy to generate the final
predictions. Our code and data is available at

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需训练、推理时控制的方法，使基于流的文本到图像模型具有多样性感知能力，通过特征空间目标和时间调度的随机扰动来提升生成多样性，同时保持图像质量和提示对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于流的文本到图像模型遵循确定性轨迹，用户需要重复采样来发现多样模式，这是一个成本高且效率低的过程。

Method: 通过特征空间目标同时鼓励轨迹间的横向扩展，并通过时间调度的随机扰动重新引入不确定性。关键的是，这种扰动被投影为与生成流正交，这种几何约束允许它在不降低图像细节或提示保真度的情况下增强变化。

Result: 在固定采样预算下，该方法在多个文本到图像设置中持续改进了多样性指标（如Vendi Score和Brisque），同时保持了图像质量和对齐度。

Conclusion: 该方法无需重新训练或修改基础采样器，与常见的流匹配求解器兼容，理论上被证明能够单调增加体积代理，同时由于几何约束近似保持边缘分布，这为为何生成质量能够稳健保持提供了原则性解释。

Abstract: Flow-based text-to-image models follow deterministic trajectories, forcing
users to repeatedly sample to discover diverse modes, which is a costly and
inefficient process. We present a training-free, inference-time control
mechanism that makes the flow itself diversity-aware. Our method simultaneously
encourages lateral spread among trajectories via a feature-space objective and
reintroduces uncertainty through a time-scheduled stochastic perturbation.
Crucially, this perturbation is projected to be orthogonal to the generation
flow, a geometric constraint that allows it to boost variation without
degrading image details or prompt fidelity. Our procedure requires no
retraining or modification to the base sampler and is compatible with common
flow-matching solvers. Theoretically, our method is shown to monotonically
increase a volume surrogate while, due to its geometric constraints,
approximately preserving the marginal distribution. This provides a principled
explanation for why generation quality is robustly maintained. Empirically,
across multiple text-to-image settings under fixed sampling budgets, our method
consistently improves diversity metrics such as the Vendi Score and Brisque
over strong baselines, while upholding image quality and alignment.

Abstract: Learning complex network dynamics is fundamental to understanding, modelling
and controlling real-world complex systems. There are two main problems in the
task of predicting the dynamic evolution of complex networks: on the one hand,
existing methods usually use simple graphs to describe the relationships in
complex networks; however, this approach can only capture pairwise
relationships, while there may be rich non-pairwise structured relationships in
the network. First-order GNNs have difficulty in capturing dynamic non-pairwise
relationships. On the other hand, theoretical prediction models lack accuracy
and data-driven prediction models lack interpretability. To address the above
problems, this paper proposes a higher-order network dynamics identification
method for long-term dynamic prediction of complex networks. Firstly, to
address the problem that traditional graph machine learning can only deal with
pairwise relations, dynamic hypergraph learning is introduced to capture the
higher-order non-pairwise relations among complex networks and improve the
accuracy of complex network modelling. Then, a dual-driven dynamic prediction
module for physical data is proposed. The Koopman operator theory is introduced
to transform the nonlinear dynamical differential equations for the dynamic
evolution of complex networks into linear systems for solving. Meanwhile, the
physical information neural differential equation method is utilised to ensure
that the dynamic evolution conforms to the physical laws. The dual-drive
dynamic prediction module ensures both accuracy and interpretability of the
prediction. Validated on public datasets and self-built industrial chain
network datasets, the experimental results show that the method in this paper
has good prediction accuracy and long-term prediction performance.

Method: 将回合制对话形式化为Stackelberg竞争，当前玩家作为领导者战略性地影响跟随者响应，并基于此理论提出强化学习框架来训练智能体优化说服性话语。

Result: 在三个不同的社交推理游戏中进行的综合实验表明，该方法显著优于基线模型。

Conclusion: 这项工作代表了开发具有战略性社会影响力AI智能体的重要进展，对需要说服性沟通的场景具有广泛意义。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents have shown remarkable progress in social
deduction games (SDGs). However, existing approaches primarily focus on
information processing and strategy selection, overlooking the significance of
persuasive communication in influencing other players' beliefs and responses.
In SDGs, success depends not only on making correct deductions but on
convincing others to response in alignment with one's intent. To address this
limitation, we formalize turn-based dialogue in SDGs as a Stackelberg
competition, where the current player acts as the leader who strategically
influences the follower's response. Building on this theoretical foundation, we
propose a reinforcement learning framework that trains agents to optimize
utterances for persuasive impact. Through comprehensive experiments across
three diverse SDGs, we demonstrate that our agents significantly outperform
baselines. This work represents a significant step toward developing AI agents
capable of strategic social influence, with implications extending to scenarios
requiring persuasive communication.

computational costs during deployment, highlighting a need for efficient
inference. A popular direction of efficiency improvement is to switch the LRM
between thinking and nonthinking modes dynamically. However, such approaches
often introduce additional reasoning errors and lack statistical guarantees for
the performance loss, which are critical for high-stakes applications. In this
work, we propose Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) reasoning that controls
the performance loss under the user-specified performance loss tolerance. In
particular, we construct an upper confidence bound on the performance loss,
formulated as a monotone function of the uncertainty score, and subsequently
determine a threshold for switching to the nonthinking model. Theoretically,
using the threshold to switch between the thinking and nonthinking modes
ensures bounded performance loss in a distribution-free manner. Our
comprehensive experiments on reasoning benchmarks show that the proposed method
can save computational budgets and control the user-specified performance loss.

*Emma Kondrup,Anne Imouza*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究发现大型语言模型在生成医疗建议时存在系统性偏见，对原住民和双性人等社会群体提供更复杂难懂的医疗建议，这种偏见在交叉群体中更加明显。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs在医疗领域的广泛应用，需要评估这些模型是否存在社会偏见，以及这些偏见如何影响不同社会群体获得的医疗建议质量。

Method: 通过模拟不同性别、年龄和种族的患者档案向LLMs提出一系列医疗问题，比较生成回答的自然语言特征。

Result: LLMs生成的医疗建议在不同社会群体间存在系统性差异，原住民和双性人患者收到的建议可读性更差、更复杂，交叉群体的差异更加显著。

Conclusion: 鉴于人们对LLMs日益增长的信任，迫切需要提高AI素养，并要求AI开发者进行调查和缓解措施，确保减少这些系统性差异，避免不公正的患者支持。

Abstract: With the rapid progress of Large Language Models (LLMs), the general public
now has easy and affordable access to applications capable of answering most
health-related questions in a personalized manner. These LLMs are increasingly
proving to be competitive, and now even surpass professionals in some medical
capabilities. They hold particular promise in low-resource settings,
considering they provide the possibility of widely accessible, quasi-free
healthcare support. However, evaluations that fuel these motivations highly
lack insights into the social nature of healthcare, oblivious to health
disparities between social groups and to how bias may translate into
LLM-generated medical advice and impact users. We provide an exploratory
analysis of LLM answers to a series of medical questions spanning key clinical
domains, where we simulate these questions being asked by several patient
profiles that vary in sex, age range, and ethnicity. By comparing natural
language features of the generated responses, we show that, when LLMs are used
for medical advice generation, they generate responses that systematically
differ between social groups. In particular, Indigenous and intersex patients
receive advice that is less readable and more complex. We observe these trends
amplify when intersectional groups are considered. Considering the increasing
trust individuals place in these models, we argue for higher AI literacy and
for the urgent need for investigation and mitigation by AI developers to ensure
these systemic differences are diminished and do not translate to unjust
patient support. Our code is publicly available on GitHub.

Abstract: In the field of medicine and healthcare, the utilization of medical
expertise, based on medical knowledge combined with patients' health
information is a life-critical challenge for patients and health professionals.
The within-laying complexity and variety form the need for a united approach to
gather, analyze, and utilize existing knowledge of medical treatments, and
medical operations to provide the ability to present knowledge for the means of
accurate patient-driven decision-making. One way to achieve this is the fusion
of multiple knowledge sources in healthcare. It provides health professionals
the opportunity to select from multiple contextual aligned knowledge sources
which enables the support for critical decisions. This paper presents multiple
conceptual models for knowledge fusion in the field of medicine, based on a
knowledge graph structure. It will evaluate, how knowledge fusion can be
enabled and presents how to integrate various knowledge sources into the
knowledge graph for rescue operations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注NP复杂度问题，但大语言模型在空间复杂度方面的计算限制仍不清楚。PSPACE完全问题需要探索巨大搜索空间，能更严格地评估模型的计算能力。

Method: 通过双指数空间探索构建包含超过100万个正则表达式实例的数据集，使用严格过滤过程建立基准，并对6个LLM和5个LRM进行广泛评估。

Result: 评估揭示了模型在处理PSPACE完全正则表达式问题时的常见失败模式，如冗长和重复，表明模型在空间计算方面存在显著限制。

Conclusion: 这是首个对LLM和LRM空间计算限制的实证研究，为评估其高级推理能力提供了新框架，基准代码已开源。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show strong performance across natural language
processing (NLP), mathematical reasoning, and programming, and recent large
reasoning models (LRMs) further emphasize explicit reasoning. Yet their
computational limits, particularly spatial complexity constrained by finite
context windows, remain poorly understood. While recent works often focus on
problems within the NP complexity class, we push the boundary by introducing a
novel benchmark grounded in two PSPACE-complete regular expression (regex)
problems: equivalence decision (RegexEQ) and minimization (RegexMin).
PSPACE-complete problems serve as a more rigorous standard for assessing
computational capacity, as their solutions require massive search space
exploration. We perform a double-exponential space exploration to construct a
labeled dataset of over a million regex instances with a sound filtering
process to build the benchmark. We conduct extensive evaluations on 6 LLMs and
5 LRMs of varying scales, revealing common failure patterns such as verbosity
and repetition. With its well-defined structure and quantitative evaluation
metrics, this work presents the first empirical investigation into the spatial
computational limitations of LLMs and LRMs, offering a new framework for
evaluating their advanced reasoning capabilities. Our code is available at

Motivation: 传统大语言模型在现实世界任务中存在局限性，研究旨在探索开发"智能体化"LLM的模式，使其能够自动化复杂任务并缩小与人类能力的性能差距。

Method: 构建包含四个关键组件的智能体架构：感知系统将环境感知转换为有意义表示；推理系统通过思维链、思维树等技术制定计划、适应反馈和评估行动；记忆系统通过短期和长期机制保留知识；执行系统将内部决策转化为具体行动。

Result: 研究表明，整合这些系统能够产生更强大和通用的软件机器人，这些机器人能够模仿人类认知过程，实现自主智能行为。

Conclusion: 通过系统化整合感知、推理、记忆和执行组件，可以开发出能够模拟人类认知过程、具备自主智能行为的更强大LLM智能体。

Abstract: This paper reviews the architecture and implementation methods of agents
powered by large language models (LLMs). Motivated by the limitations of
traditional LLMs in real-world tasks, the research aims to explore patterns to
develop "agentic" LLMs that can automate complex tasks and bridge the
performance gap with human capabilities. Key components include a perception
system that converts environmental percepts into meaningful representations; a
reasoning system that formulates plans, adapts to feedback, and evaluates
actions through different techniques like Chain-of-Thought and Tree-of-Thought;
a memory system that retains knowledge through both short-term and long-term
mechanisms; and an execution system that translates internal decisions into
concrete actions. This paper shows how integrating these systems leads to more
capable and generalized software bots that mimic human cognitive processes for
autonomous and intelligent behavior.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖框架，通过可调节的局部性控制参数，使大语言模型能够在可解释的局部表示和高效的分布式表示之间连续调整，无需重新训练模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型在需要透明度的监管领域中，同时满足可解释性和高性能的挑战，提供从规则化到泛化表示的连续调节能力。

Method: 使用组稀疏惩罚、信息论锚点设计和动态规则注入，通过局部性控制参数动态调节训练和推理过程中的局部化程度。

Result: 数学证明显示，当组稀疏惩罚超过特定阈值时，注意力机制会集中在语义相关块上，实现低熵和高保真度，误差可忽略。

Conclusion: 该框架支持从业者在可解释模式和高性能模式之间连续插值，适用于需要透明度和能力的监管领域应用。

Abstract: We present a novel framework for training large language models with
continuously adjustable internal representations that span the full spectrum
from localist (interpretable, rule-based) to distributed (generalizable,
efficient) encodings. The key innovation is a locality dial, a tunable
parameter that dynamically controls the degree of localization during both
training and inference without requiring model retraining. This is achieved
through group sparsity penalties on attention mechanisms, information-theoretic
anchor design, and dynamic rule injection. We provide rigorous mathematical
proofs establishing explicit threshold conditions under which attention
provably concentrates on semantically relevant blocks, with exponential bounds
on attention entropy and pointer fidelity. Specifically, we prove that when
group sparsity penalties exceed certain threshold values, the model's attention
mechanisms concentrate on semantically relevant blocks, achieving low entropy
and high fidelity with negligible error. This framework enables practitioners
to continuously interpolate between interpretable and high-performance modes,
supporting applications in regulated domains requiring both transparency and
capability.

Motivation: 探索大语言模型在逻辑推理任务中的内部机制，理解模型如何实现推理过程而非仅作为统计学习者。

Method: 使用小语言模型研究演绎推理任务，分析其内部表示和计算电路，重点关注归纳头的作用。

Result: 发现归纳头在规则补全和规则链接步骤中发挥核心作用，是实现逻辑推理的关键机制。

Conclusion: 小语言模型能够学习并应用底层推理规则，归纳头是实现逻辑推理的重要计算组件。

Abstract: Recent large language models have demonstrated relevant capabilities in
solving problems that require logical reasoning; however, the corresponding
internal mechanisms remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we show that a
small language model can solve a deductive reasoning task by learning the
underlying rules (rather than operating as a statistical learner). A low-level
explanation of its internal representations and computational circuits is then
provided. Our findings reveal that induction heads play a central role in the
implementation of the rule completion and rule chaining steps involved in the
logical inference required by the task.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 经典约束编程模型基于后继变量，无法有效处理可选访问点或插入式启发式算法，这限制了在车辆路径问题中的应用。

Method: 形式化定义了序列变量的计算域、更新操作和一致性级别，设计了专门的数据结构和全局约束，并实现了插入式大邻域搜索。

Result: 序列变量简化了问题建模，在Dial-a-Ride问题上实现了有竞争力的计算性能。

Conclusion: 序列变量为约束编程处理车辆路径问题提供了更直观和强大的建模框架，能够有效处理可选访问和插入操作。

Abstract: Constraint Programming (CP) offers an intuitive, declarative framework for
modeling Vehicle Routing Problems (VRP), yet classical CP models based on
successor variables cannot always deal with optional visits or insertion based
heuristics. To address these limitations, this paper formalizes sequence
variables within CP. Unlike the classical successor models, this computational
domain handle optional visits and support insertion heuristics, including
insertion-based Large Neighborhood Search. We provide a clear definition of
their domain, update operations, and introduce consistency levels for
constraints on this domain. An implementation is described with the underlying
data structures required for integrating sequence variables into existing
trail-based CP solvers. Furthermore, global constraints specifically designed
for sequence variables and vehicle routing are introduced. Finally, the
effectiveness of sequence variables is demonstrated by simplifying problem
modeling and achieving competitive computational performance on the Dial-a-Ride
Problem.

Motivation: 放射学具有多模态数据流和跨系统协调工作流程的特点，非常适合利用能够适应上下文并自动化复杂重复任务的智能体系统。虽然LLMs在单个任务上表现良好，但单独使用无法充分发挥其在复杂多步骤工作流程中的潜力。

Method: 通过为LLMs配备外部工具和反馈机制，使其能够驱动表现出不同程度自主性的系统，包括半自动化工作流程和能够管理复杂过程的自适应智能体。

Result: LLM驱动的智能体系统在放射学中显示出应用潜力，能够整合多源信息、执行规划和推理，支持复杂的工作流程。

Conclusion: LLM驱动的智能体系统为放射学提供了从半自动化到自适应自主性的解决方案，但仍面临错误级联、工具使用效率和医疗IT集成等挑战。

Abstract: Building agents, systems that perceive and act upon their environment with a
degree of autonomy, has long been a focus of AI research. This pursuit has
recently become vastly more practical with the emergence of large language
models (LLMs) capable of using natural language to integrate information,
follow instructions, and perform forms of "reasoning" and planning across a
wide range of tasks. With its multimodal data streams and orchestrated
workflows spanning multiple systems, radiology is uniquely suited to benefit
from agents that can adapt to context and automate repetitive yet complex
tasks. In radiology, LLMs and their multimodal variants have already
demonstrated promising performance for individual tasks such as information
extraction and report summarization. However, using LLMs in isolation
underutilizes their potential to support complex, multi-step workflows where
decisions depend on evolving context from multiple information sources.
Equipping LLMs with external tools and feedback mechanisms enables them to
drive systems that exhibit a spectrum of autonomy, ranging from semi-automated
workflows to more adaptive agents capable of managing complex processes. This
review examines the design of such LLM-driven agentic systems, highlights key
applications, discusses evaluation methods for planning and tool use, and
outlines challenges such as error cascades, tool-use efficiency, and health IT
integration.

Abstract: Data lakehouses run sensitive workloads, where AI-driven automation raises
concerns about trust, correctness, and governance. We argue that API-first,

and declarative environments extend naturally to agents, enabling
reproducibility and observability while reducing the attack surface. We present
a proof-of-concept in which agents repair data pipelines using correctness
checks inspired by proof-carrying code. Our prototype demonstrates that
untrusted AI agents can operate safely on production data and outlines a path
toward a fully agentic lakehouse.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GraphMERT是一个小型图形编码器模型，能够从非结构化文本语料库中提取高质量知识图谱，形成模块化的神经符号堆栈，在保持最先进基准精度的同时提供可验证的符号推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决神经符号AI框架难以扩展的问题，以及神经方法隐式表示和近似推理导致的解释性和可信度限制。知识图谱作为显式语义知识的黄金标准表示可以解决符号方面的问题，但从文本语料库自动推导可靠知识图谱仍是一个开放问题。

Method: 引入GraphMERT，一个小型图形编码器模型，从非结构化文本语料库及其内部表示中提取高质量知识图谱。GraphMERT与其等效知识图谱形成模块化神经符号堆栈：神经学习抽象；符号知识图谱用于可验证推理。

Result: 在PubMed糖尿病论文文本上，80M参数的GraphMERT生成的知识图谱达到69.8%的事实分数，而32B参数的基线LLM仅达到40.2%。GraphMERT知识图谱还获得68.8%的有效性分数，而LLM基线为43.0%。

Conclusion: GraphMERT + KG是第一个高效且可扩展的神经符号模型，在实现最先进基准精度的同时，相对于基线具有优越的符号表示能力。

Abstract: Researchers have pursued neurosymbolic artificial intelligence (AI)
applications for nearly three decades because symbolic components provide
abstraction while neural components provide generalization. Thus, a marriage of
the two components can lead to rapid advancements in AI. Yet, the field has not
realized this promise since most neurosymbolic AI frameworks fail to scale. In
addition, the implicit representations and approximate reasoning of neural
approaches limit interpretability and trust. Knowledge graphs (KGs), a
gold-standard representation of explicit semantic knowledge, can address the
symbolic side. However, automatically deriving reliable KGs from text corpora
has remained an open problem. We address these challenges by introducing
GraphMERT, a tiny graphical encoder-only model that distills high-quality KGs
from unstructured text corpora and its own internal representations. GraphMERT
and its equivalent KG form a modular neurosymbolic stack: neural learning of
abstractions; symbolic KGs for verifiable reasoning. GraphMERT + KG is the
first efficient and scalable neurosymbolic model to achieve state-of-the-art
benchmark accuracy along with superior symbolic representations relative to
baselines.
  Concretely, we target reliable domain-specific KGs that are both (1) factual
(with provenance) and (2) valid (ontology-consistent relations with
domain-appropriate semantics). When a large language model (LLM), e.g.,
Qwen3-32B, generates domain-specific KGs, it falls short on reliability due to
prompt sensitivity, shallow domain expertise, and hallucinated relations. On
text obtained from PubMed papers on diabetes, our 80M-parameter GraphMERT
yields a KG with a 69.8% FActScore; a 32B-parameter baseline LLM yields a KG
that achieves only 40.2% FActScore. The GraphMERT KG also attains a higher
ValidityScore of 68.8%, versus 43.0% for the LLM baseline.

TL;DR: LiveOIBench是一个包含403个奥林匹克级别编程竞赛题目的基准测试，每个题目平均有60个专家设计的测试用例，解决了现有基准测试缺乏挑战性题目、测试覆盖不足等问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前编程基准测试存在局限性：缺乏极具挑战性的问题、测试用例覆盖不足、依赖在线平台API限制可访问性。需要更全面的基准来评估大型语言模型的编码能力。

Method: 从72个2023-2025年不同地区的官方信息学奥林匹克竞赛中收集403个专家策划的题目，每个题目配备平均60个专家设计的测试用例，建立包含详细子任务评分标准和广泛私有测试用例的评估系统。

Result: 在评估32个流行LLM后，GPT-5达到81.76百分位数，表现强劲但仍落后于顶尖人类选手（通常超过90百分位数）。开源推理模型GPT-OSS-120B仅达到60百分位数，显示与前沿闭源模型存在显著能力差距。

Conclusion: 强大的推理模型应优先进行精确的问题分析而非过度探索，未来模型应强调结构化分析并最小化不必要的探索。所有数据、代码和排行榜结果将公开提供。

Abstract: Competitive programming problems increasingly serve as valuable benchmarks to
evaluate the coding capabilities of large language models (LLMs) due to their
complexity and ease of verification. Yet, current coding benchmarks face
limitations such as lack of exceptionally challenging problems, insufficient
test case coverage, reliance on online platform APIs that limit accessibility.
To address these issues, we introduce LiveOIBench, a comprehensive benchmark
featuring 403 expert-curated Olympiad-level competitive programming problems,
each with an average of 60 expert-designed test cases. The problems are sourced
directly from 72 official Informatics Olympiads in different regions conducted
between 2023 and 2025. LiveOIBench distinguishes itself through four key
features: (1) meticulously curated high-quality tasks with detailed subtask
rubrics and extensive private test cases; (2) direct integration of elite
contestant performance data to enable informative comparison against
top-performing humans; (3) planned continuous, contamination-free updates from
newly released Olympiad problems; and (4) a self-contained evaluation system
facilitating offline and easy-to-reproduce assessments. Benchmarking 32 popular
general-purpose and reasoning LLMs, we find that GPT-5 achieves a notable
81.76th percentile, a strong result that nonetheless falls short of top human
contestant performance, who usually place above 90th. In contrast, among
open-weight reasoning models, GPT-OSS-120B achieves only a 60th percentile,
underscoring significant capability disparities from frontier closed models.
Detailed analyses indicate that robust reasoning models prioritize precise
problem analysis over excessive exploration, suggesting future models should
emphasize structured analysis and minimize unnecessary exploration. All data,
code, and leaderboard results will be made publicly available on our website.

Motivation: 边缘环境中的实时多视角3D重建面临资源可用性动态变化、图像质量下降、网络连接不稳定等挑战，需要确保在合理时间内获得高质量重建结果。

Method: 使用两个协作的Q学习代理，一个负责相机选择，一个负责服务器选择，完全在线学习策略；构建了包含实验室设备和FABRIC基础设施的分布式测试平台来模拟真实干扰场景。

Result: 该框架在动态环境中有效平衡端到端延迟和重建质量，提高了应用可靠性。

Conclusion: 强化学习框架能够有效管理边缘资源，在资源受限和易受干扰的环境中实现可靠的3D重建。

Abstract: Real-time multi-view 3D reconstruction is a mission-critical application for
key edge-native use cases, such as fire rescue, where timely and accurate 3D
scene modeling enables situational awareness and informed decision-making.
However, the dynamic and unpredictable nature of edge resource availability
introduces disruptions, such as degraded image quality, unstable network links,
and fluctuating server loads, which challenge the reliability of the
reconstruction pipeline. In this work, we present a reinforcement learning
(RL)-based edge resource management framework for reliable 3D reconstruction to
ensure high quality reconstruction within a reasonable amount of time, despite
the system operating under a resource-constrained and disruption-prone
environment. In particular, the framework adopts two cooperative Q-learning
agents, one for camera selection and one for server selection, both of which
operate entirely online, learning policies through interactions with the edge
environment. To support learning under realistic constraints and evaluate
system performance, we implement a distributed testbed comprising lab-hosted
end devices and FABRIC infrastructure-hosted edge servers to emulate smart city
edge infrastructure under realistic disruption scenarios. Results show that the
proposed framework improves application reliability by effectively balancing
end-to-end latency and reconstruction quality in dynamic environments.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种无需微调的推理时干预框架EDS，通过能量模型动态引导LLM隐藏状态，在保持安全性的同时显著降低错误拒绝率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM安全对齐技术往往过度谨慎，导致对良性提示也产生错误拒绝。需要在增强安全性的同时减少错误拒绝。

Method: 训练轻量级能量模型，将LLM内部激活映射到能量景观，使用能量函数梯度动态引导隐藏状态到低能量区域，实时修正模型响应。

Result: 在ORB-H基准测试中，合规率从57.3%提升到82.6%，同时保持基线安全性能。

Conclusion: EDS框架有效实现了低错误拒绝率和高安全性的双重目标，为构建更平衡的LLM提供了有效范例。

Abstract: Safety alignment of large language models (LLMs) faces a key challenge:
current alignment techniques often only focus on improving safety against
harmful prompts, causing LLMs to become over-cautious and refuse to respond to
benign prompts. Therefore, a key objective of safe alignment is to enhance
safety while simultaneously reducing false refusals. In this paper, we
introduce Energy-Driven Steering (EDS), a novel, fine-tuning free framework
designed to resolve this challenge through dynamic, inference-time
intervention. We trained a lightweight, external Energy-Based Model (EBM) to
assign high energy to undesirable (false refusal or jailbreak) states and low
energy to desirable (helpful response or safe reject) ones. During inference,
EBM maps the LLM's internal activations to an "energy landscape". We use the
gradient of the energy function to dynamically steer the LLM's hidden states to
low energy regions, correcting the model to generate a desirable response in
real-time without modifying its weights. This method decouples behavioral
control from the model's core knowledge, offering a flexible solution with
minimal computational overhead. Extensive experiments across a wide range of
models show our method successfully achieves this objective: it substantially
lowers false refusal rates. For example, raising compliance on the ORB-H
benchmark from 57.3% to 82.6% while maintaining the baseline safety
performance. Our work presents an effective paradigm for building LLMs that
achieve both low false refusal rates and high safety.

Motivation: 大型语言模型在面对无害编辑时会出现答案翻转问题，如RAG输出随段落重排序变化、微调侵蚀预训练学到的恒定性、推理路径依赖等，这些违反预期恒定性，破坏持续集成，迫使团队在安全性和速度之间权衡。

Method: WILSON结合了基于位置和层的无逆曲率映射（使用JVP和Hutchinson探针计算）与激活级交换子来标记重排序风险，这些信号计算成本低，适用于标准Transformer模型。

Result: WILSON能够实现具体行动：保护RAG免受顺序效应影响，捕获微调回归，稳定辩论路径和长多轮上下文，以及在部署中控制融合或重排序。

Conclusion: WILSON帮助预测故障并批准安全优化，使可靠性和吞吐量能够共同改进，而无需改变模型架构或训练。

path-dependent routes, and compiler fusion or reordering perturbs logits near
decision boundaries. These failures violate intended invariances, break
continuous integration, and force teams to trade safety for speed. The effects
are small yet distributed across layers and positions, sensitive to context
length and evaluation order, and costly to repair with retraining or formal
verification. We present WILSON, a minimal post-hoc diagnostic suite that
converts simple loop and reordering checks on internal representations into
system signals. WILSON combines an inverse-free curvature map over positions
and layers, computed with JVPs and Hutchinson probes, with activation-level
commutators that flag reorder risk. Signals are cheap to compute,
model-agnostic for standard Transformers, and exported as thresholds and CSV
artifacts for orchestrators. This enables concrete actions: guard RAG against
order effects, catch fine-tuning regressions, stabilize debate pathways and
long multi-turn contexts, and gate fusions or reorders in deployment. In short,
WILSON helps anticipate failures and approve safe optimizations so reliability
and throughput can improve together without changing model architecture or
training.

TL;DR: FedL2T是一种个性化联邦学习框架，通过双教师知识蒸馏策略解决癫痫预测中数据异质性问题，在保护隐私的同时提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 癫痫预测需要大量EEG数据，但标注成本高且涉及隐私问题。现有联邦学习方法在客户端数据异质性下性能不佳，需要更有效的个性化解决方案。

Method: 提出FedL2T框架，采用双教师知识蒸馏策略：每个客户端同时学习全局聚合模型和动态分配的同伴模型。使用自适应多级蒸馏对齐预测输出和中间特征表示，并引入近端正则化项增强训练稳定性。

Result: 在两个EEG数据集上的实验表明，FedL2T始终优于最先进的FL方法，特别是在低标签条件下。同时展现出快速稳定的收敛特性，减少了通信轮次和开销。

Conclusion: FedL2T为隐私敏感的医疗场景中的癫痫预测提供了可靠且个性化的解决方案，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: The training of deep learning models in seizure prediction requires large
amounts of Electroencephalogram (EEG) data. However, acquiring sufficient
labeled EEG data is difficult due to annotation costs and privacy constraints.
Federated Learning (FL) enables privacy-preserving collaborative training by
sharing model updates instead of raw data. However, due to the inherent
inter-patient variability in real-world scenarios, existing FL-based seizure
prediction methods struggle to achieve robust performance under heterogeneous
client settings. To address this challenge, we propose FedL2T, a personalized
federated learning framework that leverages a novel two-teacher knowledge
distillation strategy to generate superior personalized models for each client.
Specifically, each client simultaneously learns from a globally aggregated
model and a dynamically assigned peer model, promoting more direct and enriched
knowledge exchange. To ensure reliable knowledge transfer, FedL2T employs an
adaptive multi-level distillation strategy that aligns both prediction outputs
and intermediate feature representations based on task confidence. In addition,
a proximal regularization term is introduced to constrain personalized model
updates, thereby enhancing training stability. Extensive experiments on two EEG
datasets demonstrate that FedL2T consistently outperforms state-of-the-art FL
methods, particularly under low-label conditions. Moreover, FedL2T exhibits
rapid and stable convergence toward optimal performance, thereby reducing the
number of communication rounds and associated overhead. These results
underscore the potential of FedL2T as a reliable and personalized solution for
seizure prediction in privacy-sensitive healthcare scenarios.

TL;DR: RareNet是一种基于子图的图神经网络，仅需患者表型数据即可识别最可能的致病基因，并为靶向临床调查检索聚焦的患者子图。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 罕见遗传病诊断面临关键挑战：患者数据不足、全基因组测序不可及、可能的致病基因数量庞大，导致诊断过程漫长、治疗不当和关键延误，特别是在资源有限地区。

Method: 提出RareNet，一种基于子图的图神经网络方法，仅使用患者表型数据来识别最可能的致病基因并检索相关患者子图。

Result: 在两个生物医学数据集上的综合评估显示，RareNet在因果基因预测方面具有竞争力和鲁棒性，与其他框架集成时显著提升性能。

Conclusion: RareNet通过仅需表型数据（在任何临床环境中都容易获得），使复杂遗传分析更加普及，特别为缺乏先进基因组基础设施的服务不足人群提供价值。

Abstract: Rare genetic disease diagnosis faces critical challenges: insufficient
patient data, inaccessible full genome sequencing, and the immense number of
possible causative genes. These limitations cause prolonged diagnostic
journeys, inappropriate treatments, and critical delays, disproportionately
affecting patients in resource-limited settings where diagnostic tools are
scarce. We propose RareNet, a subgraph-based Graph Neural Network that requires
only patient phenotypes to identify the most likely causal gene and retrieve
focused patient subgraphs for targeted clinical investigation. RareNet can
function as a standalone method or serve as a pre-processing or post-processing
filter for other candidate gene prioritization methods, consistently enhancing
their performance while potentially enabling explainable insights. Through
comprehensive evaluation on two biomedical datasets, we demonstrate competitive
and robust causal gene prediction and significant performance gains when
integrated with other frameworks. By requiring only phenotypic data, which is
readily available in any clinical setting, RareNet democratizes access to
sophisticated genetic analysis, offering particular value for underserved
populations lacking advanced genomic infrastructure.

TL;DR: BioCodec是一个受神经编解码器启发的表示学习框架，用于将生物信号（如EEG）转换为离散令牌，在多个下游任务中表现出色，特别是在低资源环境下。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经生理记录（如EEG）产生高维噪声时间序列数据，通常需要大量预处理和手工特征提取。现有基于大型预训练模型的方法面临挑战，需要一种更有效的表示学习方法。

Method: 提出BioCodec框架，受神经编解码器启发，将生物信号的低级特征捕获为离散令牌。在数千小时EEG数据上预训练，适用于多种生物信号类型。

Conclusion: BioCodec提供了一种通用的生物信号令牌化解决方案，性能与最先进模型相当，代码和模型检查点已开源。

Abstract: Neurophysiological recordings such as electroencephalography (EEG) offer
accessible and minimally invasive means of estimating physiological activity
for applications in healthcare, diagnostic screening, and even immersive
entertainment. However, these recordings yield high-dimensional, noisy
time-series data that typically require extensive pre-processing and
handcrafted feature extraction to reveal meaningful information. Recently,
there has been a surge of interest in applying representation learning
techniques from large pre-trained (foundation) models to effectively decode and
interpret biosignals. We discuss the challenges posed for incorporating such
methods and introduce BioCodec, an alternative representation learning
framework inspired by neural codecs to capture low-level signal characteristics
in the form of discrete tokens. Pre-trained on thousands of EEG hours, BioCodec
shows efficacy across multiple downstream tasks, ranging from clinical
diagnostic tasks and sleep physiology to decoding speech and motor imagery,
particularly in low-resource settings. Additionally, we provide a qualitative
analysis of codebook usage and estimate the spatial coherence of codebook
embeddings from EEG connectivity. Notably, we also document the suitability of
our method to other biosignal data, i.e., electromyographic (EMG) signals.
Overall, the proposed approach provides a versatile solution for biosignal
tokenization that performs competitively with state-of-the-art models. The
source code and model checkpoints are shared.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界时间序列具有复杂的非平稳特性，会导致分布偏移，现有实例归一化技术无法处理单个实例内部的分布偏移，导致性能不佳。

Method: 提出两种点级方法：LD通过在不同时间步使用不同参数拟合输入和输出的内部分布来消除内部差异；LCD使用神经网络预测输出的缩放系数。

Result: 在多个公共基准测试中使用不同骨干模型进行评估，证明了点级范式的有效性。

Conclusion: 点级方法能够有效处理时间序列预测中的内部分布偏移问题，提升模型性能。

Abstract: Real-world time series are influenced by numerous factors and exhibit complex
non-stationary characteristics. Non-stationarity can lead to distribution
shifts, where the statistical properties of time series change over time,
negatively impacting model performance. Several instance normalization
techniques have been proposed to address distribution shifts in time series
forecasting. However, existing methods fail to account for shifts within
individual instances, leading to suboptimal performance. To tackle
inner-instance distribution shifts, we propose two novel point-level methods:
Learning Distribution (LD) and Learning Conditional Distribution (LCD). LD
eliminates internal discrepancies by fitting the internal distribution of input
and output with different parameters at different time steps, while LCD
utilizes neural networks to predict scaling coefficients of the output. We
evaluate the performance of the two methods with various backbone models across
public benchmarks and demonstrate the effectiveness of the point-level paradigm
through comparative experiments.

Motivation: 现有的语言赋能基础模型(如CLIP、GraphCLIP)在少样本学习中依赖开放环境中收集的小型任务特定支持数据集，容易受到中毒攻击，而现有防御方法缺乏形式化保证且对未知和自适应攻击脆弱。

Method: LeFCert整合文本和特征嵌入，采用自适应混合机制。通过双重修剪均值原型和推导分类分数的可证明上下界来实现鲁棒性。还提出了LeFCert-L(引入随机平滑)和LeFCert-C(集体认证)两个变体。

Conclusion: LeFCert是首个为语言赋能基础模型设计的可证明鲁棒少样本分类器，有效解决了中毒攻击问题，提供了形式化鲁棒性保证，具有实用价值。

Abstract: Language-empowered foundation models (LeFMs), such as CLIP and GraphCLIP,
have transformed multimodal learning by aligning visual (or graph) features
with textual representations, enabling powerful downstream capabilities like
few-shot learning. However, the reliance on small, task-specific support
datasets collected in open environments exposes these models to poisoning
attacks, where adversaries manipulate the support samples to degrade
performance. Existing defenses rely on empirical strategies, which lack formal
guarantees and remain vulnerable to unseen and adaptive attacks. Certified
robustness offers provable guarantees but has been largely unexplored for
few-shot classifiers based on LeFMs. This study seeks to fill these critical
gaps by proposing the first provably robust few-shot classifier that is
tailored for LeFMs. We term our model Language-empowered Few-shot Certification
(\textbf{LeFCert}). It integrates both textual and feature embeddings with an
adaptive blending mechanism. To achieve provable robustness, we propose a
twofold trimmed mean prototype and derive provable upper and lower bounds for
classification scores, enabling certification under worst-case poisoning
scenarios. To further enhance the performance, we extend LeFCert with two
variants by considering a more realistic and tighter attack budget: LeFCert-L
incorporates randomized smoothing to provide Lipschitz continuity and derive
robustness under dual budget constraints, and LeFCert-C provides collective
certification for scenarios where attackers distribute a shared poisoning
budget across multiple samples. Experiments demonstrate that LeFCert achieves
state-of-the-art performance, significantly improving both clean and certified
accuracy compared to existing baselines. Despite its advanced robustness
mechanisms, LeFCert is computationally efficient, making it practical for
real-world applications.

Abstract: In collaborative data sharing and machine learning, multiple parties
aggregate their data resources to train a machine learning model with better
model performance. However, as the parties incur data collection costs, they
are only willing to do so when guaranteed incentives, such as fairness and
individual rationality. Existing frameworks assume that all parties join the
collaboration simultaneously, which does not hold in many real-world scenarios.
Due to the long processing time for data cleaning, difficulty in overcoming
legal barriers, or unawareness, the parties may join the collaboration at
different times. In this work, we propose the following perspective: As a party
who joins earlier incurs higher risk and encourages the contribution from other
wait-and-see parties, that party should receive a reward of higher value for
sharing data earlier. To this end, we propose a fair and time-aware data
sharing framework, including novel time-aware incentives. We develop new
methods for deciding reward values to satisfy these incentives. We further
illustrate how to generate model rewards that realize the reward values and
empirically demonstrate the properties of our methods on synthetic and
real-world datasets.

Motivation: 高维数据可视化中常用的质量度量指标对均匀缩放敏感，即使缩放不会实质改变投影的特性，这影响了降维技术评估的准确性。

Method: 通过分析和实证研究缩放对应力和KL散度的影响，引入简单技术使这两个度量指标具有尺度不变性。

Result: 研究表明缩放会显著改变度量值，影响降维技术评估，提出的尺度不变方法在小基准测试中能准确捕捉预期行为。

Conclusion: 需要采用尺度不变的质量度量来更准确地评估高维数据可视化投影的质量。

Abstract: Complex, high-dimensional data is ubiquitous across many scientific
disciplines, including machine learning, biology, and the social sciences. One
of the primary methods of visualizing these datasets is with two-dimensional
scatter plots that visually capture some properties of the data. Because
visually determining the accuracy of these plots is challenging, researchers
often use quality metrics to measure the projection's accuracy and faithfulness
to the original data. One of the most commonly employed metrics, normalized
stress, is sensitive to uniform scaling (stretching, shrinking) of the
projection, despite this act not meaningfully changing anything about the
projection. Another quality metric, the Kullback--Leibler (KL) divergence used
in the popular t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) technique,
is also susceptible to this scale sensitivity. We investigate the effect of
scaling on stress and KL divergence analytically and empirically by showing
just how much the values change and how this affects dimension reduction
technique evaluations. We introduce a simple technique to make both metrics
scale-invariant and show that it accurately captures expected behavior on a
small benchmark.

Conclusion: CATS-Linear通过分类辅助通道独立和重新设计的分解架构，有效提升了线性模型的预测性能，在固定超参数设置下实现了最先进的预测精度。

Abstract: Recent research demonstrates that linear models achieve forecasting
performance competitive with complex architectures, yet methodologies for
enhancing linear models remain underexplored. Motivated by the hypothesis that
distinct time series instances may follow heterogeneous linear mappings, we
propose the Classification Auxiliary Trend-Seasonal Decoupling Linear Model
CATS-Linear, employing Classification Auxiliary Channel-Independence (CACI).
CACI dynamically routes instances to dedicated predictors via classification,
enabling supervised channel design. We further analyze the theoretical expected
risks of different channel settings. Additionally, we redesign the
trend-seasonal decomposition architecture by adding a decoupling -- linear
mapping -- recoupling framework for trend components and complex-domain linear
projections for seasonal components. Extensive experiments validate that
CATS-Linear with fixed hyperparameters achieves state-of-the-art accuracy
comparable to hyperparameter-tuned baselines while delivering SOTA accuracy
against fixed-hyperparameter counterparts.

Motivation: 现有CTR研究主要关注训练阶段优化，忽略了推理阶段的改进机会。低频特征组合会降低预测性能，导致不可靠输出。

Result: 离线和在线A/B测试验证了MATT在现有CTR模型上的兼容性和有效性。

Conclusion: MATT能够解锁已训练CTR模型的预测潜力，通过测试时优化提升模型性能。

Abstract: Recently, a growing body of research has focused on either optimizing CTR
model architectures to better model feature interactions or refining training
objectives to aid parameter learning, thereby achieving better predictive
performance. However, previous efforts have primarily focused on the training
phase, largely neglecting opportunities for optimization during the inference
phase. Infrequently occurring feature combinations, in particular, can degrade
prediction performance, leading to unreliable or low-confidence outputs. To
unlock the predictive potential of trained CTR models, we propose a
Model-Agnostic Test-Time paradigm (MATT), which leverages the confidence scores
of feature combinations to guide the generation of multiple inference paths,
thereby mitigating the influence of low-confidence features on the final
prediction. Specifically, to quantify the confidence of feature combinations,
we introduce a hierarchical probabilistic hashing method to estimate the
occurrence frequencies of feature combinations at various orders, which serve
as their corresponding confidence scores. Then, using the confidence scores as
sampling probabilities, we generate multiple instance-specific inference paths
through iterative sampling and subsequently aggregate the prediction scores
from multiple paths to conduct robust predictions. Finally, extensive offline
experiments and online A/B tests strongly validate the compatibility and
effectiveness of MATT across existing CTR models.

Abstract: Genomic Selection (GS) uses whole-genome information to predict crop
phenotypes and accelerate breeding. Traditional GS methods, however, struggle
with prediction accuracy for complex traits and large datasets. We propose
DPCformer, a deep learning model integrating convolutional neural networks with
a self-attention mechanism to model complex genotype-phenotype relationships.
We applied DPCformer to 13 traits across five crops (maize, cotton, tomato,
rice, chickpea). Our approach uses an 8-dimensional one-hot encoding for SNP
data, ordered by chromosome, and employs the PMF algorithm for feature
selection. Evaluations show DPCformer outperforms existing methods. In maize
datasets, accuracy for traits like days to tasseling and plant height improved
by up to 2.92%. For cotton, accuracy gains for fiber traits reached 8.37%. On
small-sample tomato data, the Pearson Correlation Coefficient for a key trait
increased by up to 57.35%. In chickpea, the yield correlation was boosted by
16.62%. DPCformer demonstrates superior accuracy, robustness in small-sample

Motivation: 现有特征缓存方法假设相邻时间步的特征相似或连续，但这在扩散模型中并不总是成立。通过频域分析发现，低频分量相似度高但连续性差，高频分量连续性好但相似度低。

Method: 提出FreqCa方法：直接复用相似度高的低频分量特征，使用二阶Hermite插值器预测连续性好但相似度低的高频分量。同时提出缓存累积残差特征(CRF)，将内存占用减少99%。

Conclusion: 频率感知缓存方法通过区分处理不同频率分量的动态特性，有效解决了扩散变换器推理成本高的问题，同时大幅减少了内存占用。

Abstract: The application of diffusion transformers is suffering from their significant
inference costs. Recently, feature caching has been proposed to solve this
problem by reusing features from previous timesteps, thereby skipping
computation in future timesteps. However, previous feature caching assumes that
features in adjacent timesteps are similar or continuous, which does not always
hold in all settings. To investigate this, this paper begins with an analysis
from the frequency domain, which reveal that different frequency bands in the
features of diffusion models exhibit different dynamics across timesteps.
Concretely, low-frequency components, which decide the structure of images,
exhibit higher similarity but poor continuity. In contrast, the high-frequency
bands, which decode the details of images, show significant continuity but poor
similarity. These interesting observations motivate us to propose
Frequency-aware Caching (FreqCa)
  which directly reuses features of low-frequency components based on their
similarity, while using a second-order Hermite interpolator to predict the
volatile high-frequency ones based on its continuity.
  Besides, we further propose to cache Cumulative Residual Feature (CRF)
instead of the features in all the layers, which reduces the memory footprint
of feature caching by 99%.
  Extensive experiments on FLUX.1-dev, FLUX.1-Kontext-dev, Qwen-Image, and
Qwen-Image-Edit demonstrate its effectiveness in both generation and editing.
Codes are available in the supplementary materials and will be released on

Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has become a standard
recipe for improving large language models (LLMs) on reasoning tasks, with
Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) widely used in practice. Yet GRPO
wastes substantial compute on negative groups: groups in which no sampled
response is correct yield zero advantage and thus no gradient. We ask whether
negative groups can be leveraged without extra supervision. Starting from a
maximum-likelihood (MLE) objective in reward modeling, we show that the MLE
gradient is equivalent to a policy gradient for a modified value function. This
value function adds a confidence-weighted penalty on incorrect responses,
imposing larger penalties on more confident mistakes. We refer to this as
\textbf{L}ikelihood \textbf{E}stimation with \textbf{N}egative \textbf{S}amples
(\textbf{LENS}). LENS modifies GRPO to assign non-zero, confidence-dependent
rewards to incorrect generations, making negative groups informative and
converting previously wasted samples into useful gradient updates. On the MATH
benchmark with Llama-3.1-8B and Qwen-2.5-3B, the proposed variant consistently
outperforms GRPO baseline, with significant gains on harder items. These
results demonstrate a principled and practical way to "rescue" negative groups,
improving efficiency and performance in RLVR.

Abstract: Channel equalization is fundamental for mitigating distortions such as
frequency-selective fading and inter-symbol interference. Unlike standard
supervised learning approaches that require costly retraining or fine-tuning
for each new task, in-context learning (ICL) adapts to new channels at
inference time with only a few examples. However, existing ICL-based equalizers
are primarily developed for and evaluated on static channels within the context
window. Indeed, to our knowledge, prior principled analyses and theoretical
studies of ICL focus exclusively on the stationary setting, where the function
remains fixed within the context. In this paper, we investigate the ability of
ICL to address non-stationary problems through the lens of time-varying channel
equalization. We employ a principled framework for designing efficient
attention mechanisms with improved adaptivity in non-stationary tasks,
leveraging algorithms from adaptive signal processing to guide better designs.
For example, new attention variants can be derived from the Least Mean Square
(LMS) adaptive algorithm, a Least Root Mean Square (LRMS) formulation for
enhanced robustness, or multi-step gradient updates for improved long-term
tracking. Experimental results demonstrate that ICL holds strong promise for
non-stationary MIMO equalization, and that attention mechanisms inspired by
classical adaptive algorithms can substantially enhance adaptability and
performance in dynamic environments. Our findings may provide critical insights
for developing next-generation wireless foundation models with stronger
adaptability and robustness.

Conclusion: 正交对齐现象为多模态研究中的参数高效缩放提供了新方向。

Abstract: Cross-domain sequential recommendation (CDSR) aims to align heterogeneous
user behavior sequences collected from different domains. While cross-attention
is widely used to enhance alignment and improve recommendation performance, its
underlying mechanism is not fully understood. Most researchers interpret
cross-attention as residual alignment, where the output is generated by
removing redundant and preserving non-redundant information from the query
input by referencing another domain data which is input key and value. Beyond
the prevailing view, we introduce Orthogonal Alignment, a phenomenon in which
cross-attention discovers novel information that is not present in the query
input, and further argue that those two contrasting alignment mechanisms can
co-exist in recommendation models We find that when the query input and output
of cross-attention are orthogonal, model performance improves over 300
experiments. Notably, Orthogonal Alignment emerges naturally, without any
explicit orthogonality constraints. Our key insight is that Orthogonal
Alignment emerges naturally because it improves scaling law. We show that
baselines additionally incorporating cross-attention module outperform
parameter-matched baselines, achieving a superior accuracy-per-model parameter.
We hope these findings offer new directions for parameter-efficient scaling in
multi-modal research.

Abstract: Instance discrimination is a self-supervised representation learning paradigm
wherein individual instances within a dataset are treated as distinct classes.
This is typically achieved by generating two disparate views of each instance
by applying stochastic transformations, which encourages the model to learn
representations that are invariant to the common underlying object across these
views.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了Counterfactually Fair Conformal Prediction (CF-CP)方法，通过对称化保护属性干预下的符合性分数，在保持边际覆盖性质的同时实现反事实公平的预测集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然点预测器的反事实公平性已有研究，但预测集的反事实公平性在不确定性下的公平决策中至关重要，而现有方法如保形预测(CP)虽能提供有效的预测集，但不能保证反事实公平。

Method: 通过对称化保护属性干预下的符合性分数，开发CF-CP方法，在保持保形预测的分布无关、有限样本有效性的同时确保反事实公平。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的实验表明，CF-CP在回归和分类任务中都能实现所需的反事实公平性，并以最小的预测集大小增加达到目标覆盖率。

Conclusion: CF-CP提供了一种简单、无需训练的路径来实现反事实公平的不确定性量化，填补了反事实公平预测集研究的空白。

Abstract: While counterfactual fairness of point predictors is well studied, its
extension to prediction sets--central to fair decision-making under
uncertainty--remains underexplored. On the other hand, conformal prediction
(CP) provides efficient, distribution-free, finite-sample valid prediction
sets, yet does not ensure counterfactual fairness. We close this gap by
developing Counterfactually Fair Conformal Prediction (CF-CP) that produces
counterfactually fair prediction sets. Through symmetrization of conformity
scores across protected-attribute interventions, we prove that CF-CP results in
counterfactually fair prediction sets while maintaining the marginal coverage
property. Furthermore, we empirically demonstrate that on both synthetic and
real datasets, across regression and classification tasks, CF-CP achieves the
desired counterfactual fairness and meets the target coverage rate with minimal
increase in prediction set size. CF-CP offers a simple, training-free route to
counterfactually fair uncertainty quantification.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型行为控制技术（如激活向量修改或权重矩阵更新）多基于经验启发式方法，缺乏理论支撑。本文旨在为这些干预技术提供理论基础。

Method: 基于Dherin等人关于提示影响可数学映射为隐式权重更新的发现，将该理论推广到深层多块Transformer。通过分析用户提示信息在内部的表示和组合方式，推导出将信息压缩为token无关思想向量和思想矩阵的原则性方法。

Result: 开发了将文本输入转化为可重用权重更新的计算基础方法，为现有的向量和矩阵模型编辑技术提供了理论解释。

Conclusion: 提出的思想向量和思想矩阵为模型编辑技术提供了理论基础，实现了文本输入到权重更新的直接转换，为LLM控制技术提供了计算基础。

Abstract: A growing body of research has demonstrated that the behavior of large
language models can be effectively controlled at inference time by directly
modifying their internal states, either through vector additions to their
activations or through updates to their weight matrices. These techniques,
while powerful, are often guided by empirical heuristics, such as deriving
steering vectors from the average activations of contrastive prompts. This work
provides a theoretical foundation for these interventions, explaining how they
emerge from the fundamental computations of the transformer architecture.
Building on the recent finding that a prompt's influence can be mathematically
mapped to implicit weight updates (Dherin et al., 2025), we generalize this
theory to deep, multi-block transformers. We show how the information contained
in any chunk of a user prompt is represented and composed internally through
weight vectors and weight matrices. We then derive a principled method for
condensing this information into token-independent thought vectors and thought
matrices. These constructs provide a theoretical explanation for existing
vector- and matrix-based model editing techniques and offer a direct,
computationally-grounded method for transmuting textual input into reusable
weight updates.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型黑盒模型虽然能处理复杂数据，但缺乏可解释性，在高风险场景中不可靠。需要开发能够解释预测过程的方法来增强模型的可信度。

Method: 使用SHAP分析量化每个特征对预测的贡献，然后对SHAP值进行聚类，将具有相似预测原因的数据样本分组。

Result: 通过模拟实验和阿尔茨海默病案例研究验证了该方法的有效性，能够识别不同样本达到相同预测结果的各种路径。

Conclusion: SHAP值聚类提供了一种有效的模型解释方法，能够揭示黑盒模型的决策过程，增强模型在高风险应用中的可信度。

Abstract: In this growing age of data and technology, large black-box models are
becoming the norm due to their ability to handle vast amounts of data and learn
incredibly complex input-output relationships. The deficiency of these methods,
however, is their inability to explain the prediction process, making them
untrustworthy and their use precarious in high-stakes situations. SHapley
Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis is an explainable AI method growing in
popularity for its ability to explain model predictions in terms of the
original features. For each sample and feature in the data set, we associate a
SHAP value that quantifies the contribution of that feature to the prediction
of that sample. Clustering these SHAP values can provide insight into the data
by grouping samples that not only received the same prediction, but received
the same prediction for similar reasons. In doing so, we map the various
pathways through which distinct samples arrive at the same prediction. To
showcase this methodology, we present a simulated experiment in addition to a
case study in Alzheimer's disease using data from the Alzheimer's Disease
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. We also present a novel generalization
of the waterfall plot for multi-classification.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个双方法框架，通过代理模型解释和频谱可预测性分析来解决复杂时间序列集成模型的解释性和可预测性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代时间序列预测依赖复杂的AutoML集成模型，虽然精度高但缺乏透明度和可解释性，需要解决准确性与可解释性之间的权衡问题。

Method: 1. 使用LightGBM作为代理模型来模仿AutoGluon的预测，实现基于SHAP的特征归因；2. 集成频谱可预测性分析来量化每个序列的内在可预测性。

Result: 在M5数据集上的实证评估显示，更高的频谱可预测性与改进的预测精度和代理模型保真度强相关，可预测性指标可作为有效的过滤机制和置信度评分。

Conclusion: 该框架为最先进的集成预测提供了可解释的实例级解释，同时为用户提供了可预测性指标，作为预测及其解释的可靠性指示器。

Abstract: Modern time series forecasting increasingly relies on complex ensemble models
generated by AutoML systems like AutoGluon, delivering superior accuracy but
with significant costs to transparency and interpretability. This paper
introduces a comprehensive, dual-approach framework that addresses both the
explainability and forecastability challenges in complex time series ensembles.
First, we develop a surrogate-based explanation methodology that bridges the
accuracy-interpretability gap by training a LightGBM model to faithfully mimic
AutoGluon's time series forecasts, enabling stable SHAP-based feature
attributions. We rigorously validated this approach through feature injection
experiments, demonstrating remarkably high faithfulness between extracted SHAP
values and known ground truth effects. Second, we integrated spectral
predictability analysis to quantify each series' inherent forecastability. By
comparing each time series' spectral predictability to its pure noise
benchmarks, we established an objective mechanism to gauge confidence in
forecasts and their explanations. Our empirical evaluation on the M5 dataset
found that higher spectral predictability strongly correlates not only with
improved forecast accuracy but also with higher fidelity between the surrogate
and the original forecasting model. These forecastability metrics serve as
effective filtering mechanisms and confidence scores, enabling users to
calibrate their trust in both the forecasts and their explanations. We further
demonstrated that per-item normalization is essential for generating meaningful
SHAP explanations across heterogeneous time series with varying scales. The
resulting framework delivers interpretable, instance-level explanations for
state-of-the-art ensemble forecasts, while equipping users with forecastability
metrics that serve as reliability indicators for both predictions and their
explanations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有上下文学习在分子设计中效果有限，且每个属性的标记数据稀缺，需要一种能够利用少量示例进行分子设计的方法。

Method: 使用演示条件扩散模型，通过少量分子-评分示例指导去噪Transformer生成目标分子；开发了节点对编码的分子分词器，将分子表示在基元级别；在包含数百万上下文任务的数据集上预训练了7亿参数模型。

Conclusion: DemoDiff作为分子基础模型，在上下文分子设计中表现出色，为分子设计提供了新的有效方法。

Abstract: In-context learning allows large models to adapt to new tasks from a few
demonstrations, but it has shown limited success in molecular design. Existing
databases such as ChEMBL contain molecular properties spanning millions of
biological assays, yet labeled data for each property remain scarce. To address
this limitation, we introduce demonstration-conditioned diffusion models
(DemoDiff), which define task contexts using a small set of molecule-score
examples instead of text descriptions. These demonstrations guide a denoising
Transformer to generate molecules aligned with target properties. For scalable
pretraining, we develop a new molecular tokenizer with Node Pair Encoding that
represents molecules at the motif level, requiring 5.5$\times$ fewer nodes. We
curate a dataset containing millions of context tasks from multiple sources
covering both drugs and materials, and pretrain a 0.7-billion-parameter model
on it. Across 33 design tasks in six categories, DemoDiff matches or surpasses
language models 100-1000$\times$ larger and achieves an average rank of 3.63
compared to 5.25-10.20 for domain-specific approaches. These results position
DemoDiff as a molecular foundation model for in-context molecular design. Our

Conclusion: RFOD通过特征级条件重构和创新的评分机制，有效解决了混合类型表格数据异常检测中的语义保持和可解释性问题，为高风险领域的异常检测提供了可靠解决方案。

Abstract: Outlier detection in tabular data is crucial for safeguarding data integrity
in high-stakes domains such as cybersecurity, financial fraud detection, and
healthcare, where anomalies can cause serious operational and economic impacts.
Despite advances in both data mining and deep learning, many existing methods
struggle with mixed-type tabular data, often relying on encoding schemes that
lose important semantic information. Moreover, they frequently lack
interpretability, offering little insight into which specific values cause
anomalies. To overcome these challenges, we introduce \textsf{\textbf{RFOD}}, a
novel \textsf{\textbf{R}}andom \textsf{\textbf{F}}orest-based
\textsf{\textbf{O}}utlier \textsf{\textbf{D}}etection framework tailored for
tabular data. Rather than modeling a global joint distribution, \textsf{RFOD}
reframes anomaly detection as a feature-wise conditional reconstruction
problem, training dedicated random forests for each feature conditioned on the
others. This design robustly handles heterogeneous data types while preserving
the semantic integrity of categorical features. To further enable precise and
interpretable detection, \textsf{RFOD} combines Adjusted Gower's Distance (AGD)
for cell-level scoring, which adapts to skewed numerical data and accounts for
categorical confidence, with Uncertainty-Weighted Averaging (UWA) to aggregate
cell-level scores into robust row-level anomaly scores. Extensive experiments
on 15 real-world datasets demonstrate that \textsf{RFOD} consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in detection accuracy while offering
superior robustness, scalability, and interpretability for mixed-type tabular
data.

Conclusion: 提出的方法能够为深度学习模型提供可证明的风险保证，特别适用于对尾部风险敏感的高风险应用，并通过端到端训练改善了平均性能。

Abstract: While deep learning models often achieve high predictive accuracy, their
predictions typically do not come with any provable guarantees on risk or
reliability, which are critical for deployment in high-stakes applications. The
framework of conformal risk control (CRC) provides a distribution-free,
finite-sample method for controlling the expected value of any bounded monotone
loss function and can be conveniently applied post-hoc to any pre-trained deep
learning model. However, many real-world applications are sensitive to tail
risks, as opposed to just expected loss. In this work, we develop a method for
controlling the general class of Optimized Certainty-Equivalent (OCE) risks, a
broad class of risk measures which includes as special cases the expected loss
(generalizing the original CRC method) and common tail risks like the
conditional value-at-risk (CVaR). Furthermore, standard post-hoc CRC can
degrade average-case performance due to its lack of feedback to the model. To
address this, we introduce "conformal risk training," an end-to-end approach
that differentiates through conformal OCE risk control during model training or
fine-tuning. Our method achieves provable risk guarantees while demonstrating
significantly improved average-case performance over post-hoc approaches on
applications to controlling classifiers' false negative rate and controlling
financial risk in battery storage operation.

TL;DR: 提出了一个联邦学习框架，用于量化客户端内和客户端间的细粒度跨样本记忆化风险，揭示了FL模型确实会记忆客户端数据，特别是客户端内数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有FL记忆化检测技术一次只关注一个样本，低估了跨样本记忆化的微妙风险，而集中式学习的细粒度方法无法直接应用于FL。

Method: 提出了一个框架，使用细粒度跨样本记忆化测量来量化FL中的客户端内和客户端间记忆化，并研究了解码策略、前缀长度和FL算法等关键因素。

Result: 发现FL模型确实会记忆客户端数据，特别是客户端内数据多于客户端间数据，记忆化受到训练和推理因素的影响。

Conclusion: FL模型存在记忆化风险，特别是客户端内数据，需要关注训练和推理因素对记忆化的影响。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative training without raw data
sharing, but still risks training data memorization. Existing FL memorization
detection techniques focus on one sample at a time, underestimating more subtle
risks of cross-sample memorization. In contrast, recent work on centralized
learning (CL) has introduced fine-grained methods to assess memorization across
all samples in training data, but these assume centralized access to data and
cannot be applied directly to FL. We bridge this gap by proposing a framework
that quantifies both intra- and inter-client memorization in FL using
fine-grained cross-sample memorization measurement across all clients. Based on
this framework, we conduct two studies: (1) measuring subtle memorization
across clients and (2) examining key factors that influence memorization,
including decoding strategies, prefix length, and FL algorithms. Our findings
reveal that FL models do memorize client data, particularly intra-client data,
more than inter-client data, with memorization influenced by training and
inferencing factors.

TL;DR: 提出LOTION框架，通过随机噪声平滑方法解决量化神经网络优化中的梯度问题，保证收敛性并保持原始量化损失的全局最优性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量化神经网络优化面临根本性挑战，因为量化器是分段常数函数，导致梯度几乎处处为零且在量化阈值处未定义。现有方法如STE缺乏收敛保证。

Method: 受Nesterov平滑启发，提出LOTION框架：使用无偏随机舍入噪声的期望来近似量化损失表面，将原始量化损失替换为平滑版本。

Result: 在标准优化器下保证收敛到损失表面的局部最小值；使用随机舍入噪声时，原始量化损失的全局最小值得以保持；在合成测试集和150M/300M参数语言模型上表现优于标准QAT。

Conclusion: LOTION提供了一个有理论保证的量化优化框架，有效解决了量化神经网络训练中的梯度问题，并在实践中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Optimizing neural networks for quantized objectives is fundamentally
challenging because the quantizer is piece-wise constant, yielding zero
gradients everywhere except at quantization thresholds where the derivative is
undefined. Most existing methods deal with this issue by relaxing gradient
computations with techniques like Straight Through Estimators (STE) and do not
provide any guarantees of convergence. In this work, taking inspiration from
Nesterov smoothing, we approximate the quantized loss surface with a continuous
loss surface. In particular, we introduce LOTION, \textbf{L}ow-precision
\textbf{O}ptimization via s\textbf{T}ochastic-no\textbf{I}se
sm\textbf{O}othi\textbf{N}g, a principled smoothing framework that replaces the
raw quantized loss with its expectation under unbiased randomized-rounding
noise. In this framework, standard optimizers are guaranteed to converge to a
local minimum of the loss surface. Moreover, when using noise derived from
stochastic rounding, we show that the global minima of the original quantized
loss are preserved. We empirically demonstrate that this method outperforms
standard QAT on synthetic testbeds and on 150M- and 300M- parameter language
models.

Motivation: 空间因果推断面临两个交织的挑战：未测量的空间混杂因素（如天气、污染）和附近处理的干扰效应。现有方法通常只解决其中一个问题而忽略另一个。

Method: 两阶段方法：使用带有空间先验的条件变分自编码器从局部处理向量重构替代混杂因子，然后通过灵活的结果模型估计因果效应。

Result: 在环境健康和社会科学领域的真实数据集上，Spatial Deconfounder一致地改善了效应估计，扩展了SpaCE基准套件以包含处理干扰。

Conclusion: 通过将干扰转化为多原因信号，该框架连接了空间和去混杂文献，推进了结构化数据中的稳健因果推断。

Abstract: Causal inference in spatial domains faces two intertwined challenges: (1)
unmeasured spatial factors, such as weather, air pollution, or mobility, that
confound treatment and outcome, and (2) interference from nearby treatments
that violate standard no-interference assumptions. While existing methods
typically address one by assuming away the other, we show they are deeply
connected: interference reveals structure in the latent confounder. Leveraging
this insight, we propose the Spatial Deconfounder, a two-stage method that
reconstructs a substitute confounder from local treatment vectors using a
conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE) with a spatial prior, then estimates
causal effects via a flexible outcome model. We show that this approach enables
nonparametric identification of both direct and spillover effects under weak
assumptions--without requiring multiple treatment types or a known model of the
latent field. Empirically, we extend SpaCE, a benchmark suite for spatial
confounding, to include treatment interference, and show that the Spatial
Deconfounder consistently improves effect estimation across real-world datasets
in environmental health and social science. By turning interference into a
multi-cause signal, our framework bridges spatial and deconfounding literatures
to advance robust causal inference in structured data.

Motivation: 传统CT协议优化方法需要大量参数组合测试，计算成本高且不实用，需要更高效的优化方法

Method: 使用虚拟成像工具模拟人体肝脏病变模型，采用PPO强化学习算法优化CT采集和重建参数，最大化病变检测指数

Result: 强化学习方法在测试案例中达到全局最优检测指数，比穷举搜索减少79.7%的计算步骤

Conclusion: 虚拟成像工具与强化学习结合为CT协议管理提供了准确且计算高效的优化框架

Abstract: Protocol optimization is critical in Computed Tomography (CT) to achieve high
diagnostic image quality while minimizing radiation dose. However, due to the
complex interdependencies among CT acquisition and reconstruction parameters,
traditional optimization methods rely on exhaustive testing of combinations of
these parameters, which is often impractical. This study introduces a novel
methodology that combines virtual imaging tools with reinforcement learning to
optimize CT protocols more efficiently. Human models with liver lesions were
imaged using a validated CT simulator and reconstructed with a novel CT
reconstruction toolkit. The optimization parameter space included tube voltage,
tube current, reconstruction kernel, slice thickness, and pixel size. The
optimization process was performed using a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)
agent, which was trained to maximize an image quality objective, specifically
the detectability index (d') of liver lesions in the reconstructed images.
Optimization performance was compared against an exhaustive search performed on
a supercomputer. The proposed reinforcement learning approach achieved the
global maximum d' across test cases while requiring 79.7% fewer steps than the
exhaustive search, demonstrating both accuracy and computational efficiency.
The proposed framework is flexible and can accommodate various image quality
objectives. The findings highlight the potential of integrating virtual imaging
tools with reinforcement learning for CT protocol management.

Motivation: 解决RL策略在面临不同机器人、任务或物理参数环境时泛化能力不足的问题，提升实际应用价值。

Method: 基于白金汉π定理，将策略的观测和动作通过无量纲空间进行缩放，实现零样本迁移。在模拟钟摆、物理钟摆和HalfCheetah三个复杂度递增的环境中验证。

Result: 在动态相似环境下，缩放迁移无性能损失；在非相似环境下，缩放策略始终优于朴素迁移，显著扩展了原始策略的有效应用范围。

Conclusion: 量纲分析为增强RL策略的鲁棒性和泛化能力提供了强大实用的工具。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) policies often fail to generalize to new robots,
tasks, or environments with different physical parameters, a challenge that
limits their real-world applicability. This paper presents a simple, zero-shot
transfer method based on Buckingham's Pi Theorem to address this limitation.
The method adapts a pre-trained policy to new system contexts by scaling its
inputs (observations) and outputs (actions) through a dimensionless space,
requiring no retraining. The approach is evaluated against a naive transfer
baseline across three environments of increasing complexity: a simulated
pendulum, a physical pendulum for sim-to-real validation, and the
high-dimensional HalfCheetah. Results demonstrate that the scaled transfer
exhibits no loss of performance on dynamically similar contexts. Furthermore,
on non-similar contexts, the scaled policy consistently outperforms the naive
transfer, significantly expanding the volume of contexts where the original
policy remains effective. These findings demonstrate that dimensional analysis
provides a powerful and practical tool to enhance the robustness and
generalization of RL policies.

Result: 在检索、聚类、分类和推荐任务的零样本实验中，结构感知方法始终优于纯文本和后处理基线。顺序拼接在噪声中等长度上下文中表现更好，而并行缓存在长高信号上下文中扩展性更强。

Conclusion: 这项工作首次全面分析了内部结构感知编码，为构建更强大和上下文感知的嵌入模型提供了蓝图。

Abstract: Text embeddings from Large Language Models (LLMs) have become foundational
for numerous applications. However, these models typically operate on raw text,
overlooking the rich structural information, such as hyperlinks or citations,
that provides crucial context in many real-world datasets. This paper
introduces and systematically evaluates a new paradigm for generating
structure-aware text embeddings by integrating these structural relations
directly into the LLM's internal encoding process, rather than relying on
traditional post-hoc aggregation. We investigate two primary in-process
methods: sequential concatenation and parallel caching. Through extensive
zero-shot experiments across retrieval, clustering, classification, and
recommendation tasks, we demonstrate that our structure-aware approaches
consistently outperform both text-only and post-hoc baselines. Our analysis
reveals critical trade-offs: sequential concatenation excels with noisy,
moderate-length contexts, while parallel caching scales more effectively to
long, high-signal contexts but is more susceptible to distractors. To address
the challenge of noisy structural data, we also introduce and validate two
effective techniques: Context Distillation and Semantic Balancing. This work
provides the first comprehensive analysis of in-process structure-aware
encoding, offering a blueprint for building more powerful and contextually
aware embedding models.

*Vaibhav Jain,Gerrit Grossmann*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种通过增强观察空间提供LLM生成动作建议的框架，让RL智能体学习何时遵循或忽略LLM指导，在稀疏奖励环境中显著提升训练效率和成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RL智能体在稀疏奖励环境中探索困难，而LLM具有程序性知识和推理能力，但现有方法创建了刚性依赖，需要RL策略必须遵循LLM建议或将其直接纳入奖励函数。

Method: 通过增强观察空间提供LLM生成的动作建议，允许RL智能体学习何时遵循或忽略这些指导，利用LLM的世界知识和推理能力，同时通过软约束保持灵活性。

Result: 在三个复杂度递增的BabyAI环境中评估，LLM指导的益处随任务难度而增加。在最挑战的环境中，最终成功率相对基线提升71%，样本效率提升高达9倍，且无需修改现有RL算法。

Conclusion: 该方法有效利用了LLM的规划能力来加速RL在挑战性环境中的训练，展示了软约束指导框架的实用性。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents often struggle in sparse-reward
environments where traditional exploration strategies fail to discover
effective action sequences. Large Language Models (LLMs) possess procedural
knowledge and reasoning capabilities from text pretraining that could guide RL
exploration, but existing approaches create rigid dependencies where RL
policies must follow LLM suggestions or incorporate them directly into reward
functions. We propose a framework that provides LLM-generated action
recommendations through augmented observation spaces, allowing RL agents to
learn when to follow or ignore this guidance. Our method leverages LLMs' world
knowledge and reasoning abilities while maintaining flexibility through soft
constraints. We evaluate our approach on three BabyAI environments of
increasing complexity and show that the benefits of LLM guidance scale with
task difficulty. In the most challenging environment, we achieve 71% relative
improvement in final success rates over baseline. The approach provides
substantial sample efficiency gains, with agents reaching performance
thresholds up to 9 times faster, and requires no modifications to existing RL
algorithms. Our results demonstrate an effective method for leveraging LLM
planning capabilities to accelerate RL training in challenging environments.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出基于基函数预训练的可重用初始化框架，通过预训练多项式基神经网络，然后用于初始化复杂目标函数的网络，结合域映射机制提升训练效率和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决神经网络函数逼近面临的三个主要挑战：每个目标函数需要从头训练新模型、性能对架构和超参数敏感、模型在训练域外泛化能力差。

Method: 首先训练基神经网络来逼近参考域上的多项式族，然后使用学习到的参数初始化复杂目标函数的网络，并引入域映射机制将任意域输入转换到参考域。

Result: 在一维和二维设置中的广泛数值实验显示，该方法在训练效率、泛化能力和模型可迁移性方面都有显著提升。

Conclusion: 基于初始化的策略为可扩展和模块化的神经函数逼近提供了有前景的解决方案，完整代码已在Gitee公开。

Abstract: Neural network-based function approximation plays a pivotal role in the
advancement of scientific computing and machine learning. Yet, training such
models faces several challenges: (i) each target function often requires
training a new model from scratch; (ii) performance is highly sensitive to
architectural and hyperparameter choices; and (iii) models frequently
generalize poorly beyond the training domain. To overcome these challenges, we
propose a reusable initialization framework based on basis function
pretraining. In this approach, basis neural networks are first trained to
approximate families of polynomials on a reference domain. Their learned
parameters are then used to initialize networks for more complex target
functions. To enhance adaptability across arbitrary domains, we further
introduce a domain mapping mechanism that transforms inputs into the reference
domain, thereby preserving structural correspondence with the pretrained
models. Extensive numerical experiments in one- and two-dimensional settings
demonstrate substantial improvements in training efficiency, generalization,
and model transferability, highlighting the promise of initialization-based
strategies for scalable and modular neural function approximation. The full
code is made publicly available on Gitee.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习中非确定性和不可复现性导致跨运行和平台的结果不一致，这主要源于随机数生成和浮点计算问题。虽然随机性可以通过确定性配置控制，但浮点不一致性问题仍未解决。

Method: 开发RepDL开源库，通过强制正确舍入和顺序不变性来确保浮点计算的确定性，实现位级可复现的深度学习和推理。

Result: RepDL能够确保深度学习训练和推理在不同计算环境中的确定性和位级可复现性。

Conclusion: RepDL成功解决了深度学习中的浮点计算不一致性问题，为跨平台可复现性提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Non-determinism and non-reproducibility present significant challenges in
deep learning, leading to inconsistent results across runs and platforms. These
issues stem from two origins: random number generation and floating-point
computation. While randomness can be controlled through deterministic
configurations, floating-point inconsistencies remain largely unresolved. To
address this, we introduce RepDL, an open-source library that ensures
deterministic and bitwise-reproducible deep learning training and inference
across diverse computing environments. RepDL achieves this by enforcing correct
rounding and order invariance in floating-point computation. The source code is

Motivation: 研究在存在公共和私有奖励分布的场景下，智能体如何在观察者的监控下秘密优化私有奖励，同时避免被检测到异常行为。

Method: 将可检测性形式化为智能体实际拉臂概率与观察者预期概率之间的KL散度约束，将拉取公共次优臂建模为成功概率递减的伯努利过程，并提出基于公共和私有均值的极大极小问题。

Result: 在KL约束下，拉取公共次优臂最多以Θ(√T)的速率发生，并提出了受top-two算法启发的自适应探索算法。

Conclusion: 该研究为欺骗性多臂老虎机问题提供了理论框架和实用算法，能够在观察者监控下有效识别最佳私有臂。

Abstract: We consider a multi-armed bandit setting in which each arm has a public and a
private reward distribution. An observer expects an agent to follow Thompson
Sampling according to the public rewards, however, the deceptive agent aims to
quickly identify the best private arm without being noticed. The observer can
observe the public rewards and the pulled arms, but not the private rewards.
The agent, on the other hand, observes both the public and private rewards. We
formalize detectability as a stepwise Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence
constraint between the actual pull probabilities used by the agent and the
anticipated pull probabilities by the observer. We model successful pulling of
public suboptimal arms as a % Bernoulli process where the success probability
decreases with each successful pull, and show these pulls can happen at most at
a $\Theta(\sqrt{T}) $ rate under the KL constraint. We then formulate a maximin
problem based on public and private means, whose solution characterizes the
optimal error exponent for best private arm identification. We finally propose
an algorithm inspired by top-two algorithms. This algorithm naturally adapts
its exploration according to the hardness of pulling arms based on the public
suboptimality gaps. We provide numerical examples illustrating the
$\Theta(\sqrt{T}) $ rate and the behavior of the proposed algorithm.

TL;DR: PO-CKAN是一个基于分块有理Kolmogorov-Arnold网络(KANs)的物理信息深度算子框架，用于近似偏微分方程的解算子。它结合了DeepONet架构和PINNs原理，在Burgers方程等基准问题上表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一个能够高效学习物理一致的时空解算子，并能快速预测参数化时变偏微分方程的解的框架，同时提高函数逼近能力。

Method: 采用DeepONet风格的分支-主干架构，子网络实例化为有理KAN模块，通过PDE残差(PINN风格)损失来强制物理一致性。

Result: 在ν=0.01的Burgers方程上，PO-CKAN相比PI-DeepONet将平均相对L²误差降低了约48%，在Eikonal和扩散-反应基准问题上也达到了竞争性精度。

Conclusion: PO-CKAN框架能够准确学习算子，结果与高保真解高度匹配，验证了其在物理信息算子学习中的有效性。

Abstract: We propose PO-CKAN, a physics-informed deep operator framework based on
Chunkwise Rational Kolmogorov--Arnold Networks (KANs), for approximating the
solution operators of partial differential equations. This framework leverages
a Deep Operator Network (DeepONet) architecture that incorporates Chunkwise
Rational Kolmogorov--Arnold Network (CKAN) sub-networks for enhanced function
approximation. The principles of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) are
integrated into the operator learning framework to enforce physical
consistency. This design enables the efficient learning of physically
consistent spatio-temporal solution operators and allows for rapid prediction
for parametric time-dependent PDEs with varying inputs (e.g., parameters,
initial/boundary conditions) after training. Validated on challenging benchmark
problems, PO-CKAN demonstrates accurate operator learning with results closely
matching high-fidelity solutions. PO-CKAN adopts a DeepONet-style branch--trunk
architecture with its sub-networks instantiated as rational KAN modules, and
enforces physical consistency via a PDE residual (PINN-style) loss. On Burgers'
equation with $\nu=0.01$, PO-CKAN reduces the mean relative $L^2$ error by
approximately 48\% compared to PI-DeepONet, and achieves competitive accuracy
on the Eikonal and diffusion--reaction benchmarks.

Result: 建立了TAPAS数据集创建文档，设定了攻击性能基准，并为未来工作指明了方向。

Conclusion: TAPAS数据集将加速AI在LWE攻击方面的研究，为后量子密码分析提供重要工具支持。

Abstract: AI-powered attacks on Learning with Errors (LWE), an important hard math
problem in post-quantum cryptography, rival or outperform "classical" attacks
on LWE under certain parameter settings. Despite the promise of this approach,
a dearth of accessible data limits AI practitioners' ability to study and
improve these attacks. Creating LWE data for AI model training is time- and
compute-intensive and requires significant domain expertise. To fill this gap
and accelerate AI research on LWE attacks, we propose the TAPAS datasets, a
Toolkit for Analysis of Post-quantum cryptography using AI Systems. These
datasets cover several LWE settings and can be used off-the-shelf by AI
practitioners to prototype new approaches to cracking LWE. This work documents
TAPAS dataset creation, establishes attack performance baselines, and lays out
directions for future work.

TL;DR: 提出了Edu-EmotionNet框架，用于在线教育中的情感识别，通过动态融合多模态数据和建模时间演化来提升识别鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有情感识别方法依赖静态融合策略，假设模态输入始终可靠，但在真实学习环境中这很少成立，需要更鲁棒的方法来处理缺失或噪声模态。

Method: 包含三个关键组件：跨模态注意力对齐模块实现动态跨模态上下文共享，模态重要性估计器为每个时间步分配基于置信度的权重，时间反馈循环利用先前预测确保时间一致性。

Result: 在IEMOCAP和MOSEI的教育子集上评估，针对困惑、好奇、无聊和沮丧等情绪，实现了最先进的性能，对缺失或噪声模态表现出强鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该框架能够捕捉情感转换并自适应优先处理可靠信号，非常适合部署在实时学习系统中。

Abstract: Understanding learner emotions in online education is critical for improving
engagement and personalized instruction. While prior work in emotion
recognition has explored multimodal fusion and temporal modeling, existing
methods often rely on static fusion strategies and assume that modality inputs
are consistently reliable, which is rarely the case in real-world learning
environments. We introduce Edu-EmotionNet, a novel framework that jointly
models temporal emotion evolution and modality reliability for robust affect
recognition. Our model incorporates three key components: a Cross-Modality
Attention Alignment (CMAA) module for dynamic cross-modal context sharing, a
Modality Importance Estimator (MIE) that assigns confidence-based weights to
each modality at every time step, and a Temporal Feedback Loop (TFL) that
leverages previous predictions to enforce temporal consistency. Evaluated on
educational subsets of IEMOCAP and MOSEI, re-annotated for confusion,
curiosity, boredom, and frustration, Edu-EmotionNet achieves state-of-the-art
performance and demonstrates strong robustness to missing or noisy modalities.
Visualizations confirm its ability to capture emotional transitions and
adaptively prioritize reliable signals, making it well suited for deployment in
real-time learning systems

Abstract: Graphs provide a universal framework for representing complex relational
systems, and inferring their structural properties is a core challenge in graph
analysis and reasoning. While large language models have recently demonstrated
emerging abilities to perform symbolic and numerical reasoning, the potential
of smaller, resource-efficient models in this context remains largely
unexplored. This paper investigates whether compact transformer-based language
models can infer graph-theoretic parameters directly from textual graph
representations. To enable systematic evaluation, we introduce the
TinyGraphEstimator dataset - a balanced collection of connected graphs
generated from multiple random graph models and annotated with detailed
structural metadata. We evaluate several small open models on their ability to
predict key graph parameters such as density, clustering, and chromatic number.
Furthermore, we apply lightweight fine-tuning using the Low-Rank Adaptation
(LoRA) technique, achieving consistent improvements across all evaluated
metrics. The results demonstrate that small language models possess non-trivial
reasoning capacity over graph-structured data and can be effectively adapted
for structural inference tasks through efficient parameter tuning.

Motivation: 现实世界数据分布往往存在不平衡（长尾）特性，这导致深度分类模型偏向频繁类别，对尾部类别表现不佳。

Method: 第一阶段：从信息论角度提出新的表示学习技术，理论上等价于最小化类内距离，产生有效且分离良好的特征空间。第二阶段：开发新颖的采样策略，选择数学上信息丰富的实例，能够纠正多数类偏见的决策边界而不损害模型整体性能。

Result: 在多个长尾基准数据集上实现了最先进的性能，并通过广泛实验验证。

Conclusion: 该方法有效缓解了多数类偏见倾向，同时保留了数据集中的有价值信息，在长尾分类问题上表现出色。

Abstract: The imbalance (or long-tail) is the nature of many real-world data
distributions, which often induces the undesirable bias of deep classification
models toward frequent classes, resulting in poor performance for tail classes.
In this paper, we propose a novel two-stage learning approach to mitigate such
a majority-biased tendency while preserving valuable information within
datasets. Specifically, the first stage proposes a new representation learning
technique from the information theory perspective. This approach is
theoretically equivalent to minimizing intra-class distance, yielding an
effective and well-separated feature space. The second stage develops a novel
sampling strategy that selects mathematically informative instances, able to
rectify majority-biased decision boundaries without compromising a model's
overall performance. As a result, our approach achieves the state-of-the-art
performance across various long-tailed benchmark datasets, validated via
extensive experiments. Our code is available at

Motivation: 随着机器学习在医学影像分析中广泛应用，人们担忧算法可能对某些社会群体存在偏见。现有公平性研究主要集中在医学影像诊断任务，而忽视了涉及预测疾病进展和结果的预后场景。

Method: 提出FairTTE框架，整合先进的TTE预测和公平性算法，采用因果分析技术来识别和量化医学影像数据集中的偏见来源，进行大规模评估。

Conclusion: 需要针对所有偏见形式的整体方法，现有解决方案在鲁棒性和公平性方面存在局限，迫切需要更稳健、公平的预后模型。

Abstract: As machine learning (ML) algorithms are increasingly used in medical image
analysis, concerns have emerged about their potential biases against certain
social groups. Although many approaches have been proposed to ensure the
fairness of ML models, most existing works focus only on medical image
diagnosis tasks, such as image classification and segmentation, and overlooked
prognosis scenarios, which involve predicting the likely outcome or progression
of a medical condition over time. To address this gap, we introduce FairTTE,
the first comprehensive framework for assessing fairness in time-to-event (TTE)
prediction in medical imaging. FairTTE encompasses a diverse range of imaging
modalities and TTE outcomes, integrating cutting-edge TTE prediction and
fairness algorithms to enable systematic and fine-grained analysis of fairness
in medical image prognosis. Leveraging causal analysis techniques, FairTTE
uncovers and quantifies distinct sources of bias embedded within medical
imaging datasets. Our large-scale evaluation reveals that bias is pervasive
across different imaging modalities and that current fairness methods offer
limited mitigation. We further demonstrate a strong association between
underlying bias sources and model disparities, emphasizing the need for
holistic approaches that target all forms of bias. Notably, we find that
fairness becomes increasingly difficult to maintain under distribution shifts,
underscoring the limitations of existing solutions and the pressing need for
more robust, equitable prognostic models.

TL;DR: 本文研究了自监督对比学习(CL)与负样本监督对比学习(NSCL)在表示层面的对齐性，证明了在共享随机性的条件下，两者的表示相似性矩阵保持接近，而参数空间则可能发散。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然已有理论表明CL损失近似于NSCL损失，但这种损失层面的相似性不能保证表示层面的对齐。本文旨在探究CL和NSCL在训练过程中是否在表示层面保持对齐。

Method: 在共享随机性（相同初始化、批次和增强）的条件下训练CL和NSCL模型，分析它们的表示相似性矩阵，并提供关于CKA和RSA等对齐度量的高概率保证。

Result: 理论分析表明CL和NSCL的表示相似性矩阵在现实条件下保持接近，且对齐度随类别数增加、温度升高而改善。但参数空间的对齐不稳定，权重差异可能随时间指数增长。

Conclusion: NSCL可以作为自监督与监督学习之间的桥梁，CL-NSCL的对齐性随规模和温度增强，且NSCL比其他监督目标更能跟踪CL。

Abstract: Self-supervised contrastive learning (CL) has achieved remarkable empirical
success, often producing representations that rival supervised pre-training on
downstream tasks. Recent theory explains this by showing that the CL loss
closely approximates a supervised surrogate, Negatives-Only Supervised
Contrastive Learning (NSCL) loss, as the number of classes grows. Yet this
loss-level similarity leaves an open question: {\em Do CL and NSCL also remain
aligned at the representation level throughout training, not just in their
objectives?}
  We address this by analyzing the representation alignment of CL and NSCL
models trained under shared randomness (same initialization, batches, and
augmentations). First, we show that their induced representations remain
similar: specifically, we prove that the similarity matrices of CL and NSCL
stay close under realistic conditions. Our bounds provide high-probability
guarantees on alignment metrics such as centered kernel alignment (CKA) and
representational similarity analysis (RSA), and they clarify how alignment
improves with more classes, higher temperatures, and its dependence on batch
size. In contrast, we demonstrate that parameter-space coupling is inherently
unstable: divergence between CL and NSCL weights can grow exponentially with
training time.
  Finally, we validate these predictions empirically, showing that CL-NSCL
alignment strengthens with scale and temperature, and that NSCL tracks CL more
closely than other supervised objectives. This positions NSCL as a principled
bridge between self-supervised and supervised learning. Our code and project

TL;DR: 提出自适应时间掩码(ATM)方法来解决稀疏自编码器训练中的特征吸收问题，通过动态调整特征选择来学习更稳定的可解释特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前稀疏自编码器训练方法存在特征吸收问题，即特征相互吸收以最小化L1惩罚，这使得难以一致地识别和分析模型行为。

Method: 引入自适应时间掩码(ATM)，通过跟踪激活幅度、频率和重构贡献来计算随时间演变的重要性分数，基于统计阈值应用概率掩码机制。

Result: 在Gemma-2-2b模型上的实验表明，ATM相比TopK和JumpReLU SAEs方法显著降低了吸收分数，同时保持了优秀的重构质量。

Conclusion: ATM为学习稳定、可解释的神经网络特征提供了原则性解决方案，为更可靠的模型分析奠定了基础。

Abstract: Understanding the internal representations of large language models is
crucial for ensuring their reliability and safety, with sparse autoencoders
(SAEs) emerging as a promising interpretability approach. However, current SAE
training methods face feature absorption, where features (or neurons) are
absorbed into each other to minimize $L_1$ penalty, making it difficult to
consistently identify and analyze model behaviors. We introduce Adaptive
Temporal Masking (ATM), a novel training approach that dynamically adjusts
feature selection by tracking activation magnitudes, frequencies, and
reconstruction contributions to compute importance scores that evolve over
time. ATM applies a probabilistic masking mechanism based on statistical
thresholding of these importance scores, creating a more natural feature
selection process. Through extensive experiments on the Gemma-2-2b model, we
demonstrate that ATM achieves substantially lower absorption scores compared to
existing methods like TopK and JumpReLU SAEs, while maintaining excellent
reconstruction quality. These results establish ATM as a principled solution
for learning stable, interpretable features in neural networks, providing a
foundation for more reliable model analysis.

Conclusion: SCA方法能更精细地揭示大脑与DNN的表征对齐差异，提供对神经调谐轴的敏感测量

Abstract: The ventral, dorsal, and lateral streams in high-level human visual cortex
are implicated in distinct functional processes. Yet, deep neural networks
(DNNs) trained on a single task model the entire visual system surprisingly
well, hinting at common computational principles across these pathways. To
explore this inconsistency, we applied a novel sparse decomposition approach to
identify the dominant components of visual representations within each stream.
Consistent with traditional neuroscience research, we find a clear difference
in component response profiles across the three visual streams -- identifying
components selective for faces, places, bodies, text, and food in the ventral
stream; social interactions, implied motion, and hand actions in the lateral
stream; and some less interpretable components in the dorsal stream. Building
on this, we introduce Sparse Component Alignment (SCA), a new method for
measuring representational alignment between brains and machines that better
captures the latent neural tuning of these two visual systems. Using SCA, we
find that standard visual DNNs are more aligned with the ventral than either
dorsal or lateral representations. SCA reveals these distinctions with greater
resolution than conventional population-level geometry, offering a measure of
representational alignment that is sensitive to a system's underlying axes of
neural tuning.

Conclusion: 提出的基于CNN的多模态子空间聚类框架有效融合多模态信息，在不同融合策略下均取得优异性能。

Abstract: We present convolutional neural network (CNN) based approaches for
unsupervised multimodal subspace clustering. The proposed framework consists of
three main stages - multimodal encoder, self-expressive layer, and multimodal
decoder. The encoder takes multimodal data as input and fuses them to a latent
space representation. The self-expressive layer is responsible for enforcing
the self-expressiveness property and acquiring an affinity matrix corresponding
to the data points. The decoder reconstructs the original input data. The
network uses the distance between the decoder's reconstruction and the original
input in its training. We investigate early, late and intermediate fusion
techniques and propose three different encoders corresponding to them for
spatial fusion. The self-expressive layers and multimodal decoders are
essentially the same for different spatial fusion-based approaches. In addition
to various spatial fusion-based methods, an affinity fusion-based network is
also proposed in which the self-expressive layer corresponding to different
modalities is enforced to be the same. Extensive experiments on three datasets
show that the proposed methods significantly outperform the state-of-the-art
multimodal subspace clustering methods.

Abstract: Many science and engineering problems rely on expensive computational
simulations, where a multi-fidelity approach can accelerate the exploration of
a parameter space. We study efficient allocation of a simulation budget using a
Gaussian Process (GP) model in the binary simulation output case. This paper
introduces Bernoulli Parameter Mutual Information (BPMI), a batch active
learning algorithm for multi-fidelity GP classifiers. BPMI circumvents the
intractability of calculating mutual information in the probability space by
employing a first-order Taylor expansion of the link function. We evaluate BPMI
against several baselines on two synthetic test cases and a complex, real-world
application involving the simulation of a laser-ignited rocket combustor. In
all experiments, BPMI demonstrates superior performance, achieving higher
predictive accuracy for a fixed computational budget.

TL;DR: 本文提出Dig-DEC，一种基于信息增益的无模型决策估计系数，用于解决结构化观测决策问题。它移除了乐观主义，能处理对抗性环境，并在混合MDP中实现首个无模型遗憾界，同时改进了在线函数估计过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于乐观DEC的方法只能处理随机环境，无法扩展到对抗性环境。需要一种既能处理对抗性环境又能在随机环境中保持良好性能的方法。

Method: 引入Dig-DEC，通过纯信息增益驱动探索，移除乐观主义。改进在线函数估计过程，包括平均估计误差最小化和贝尔曼完备MDP中的平方误差最小化。

Result: Dig-DEC总是小于等于乐观DEC，在特殊情况下更小。在混合MDP中获得了首个无模型遗憾界，改进了估计误差，将遗憾界从T^{3/4}提升到T^{2/3}（在线策略），从T^{5/6}提升到T^{7/9}（离线策略）。在贝尔曼完备MDP中，遗憾界从T^{2/3}提升到√T。

Conclusion: Dig-DEC是首个能处理对抗性环境的DEC方法，在贝尔曼完备MDP中首次达到与乐观方法匹配的性能，解决了Liu等人（2025）留下的主要开放问题。

Abstract: We study decision making with structured observation (DMSO). Previous work
(Foster et al., 2021b, 2023a) has characterized the complexity of DMSO via the
decision-estimation coefficient (DEC), but left a gap between the regret upper
and lower bounds that scales with the size of the model class. To tighten this
gap, Foster et al. (2023b) introduced optimistic DEC, achieving a bound that
scales only with the size of the value-function class. However, their
optimism-based exploration is only known to handle the stochastic setting, and
it remains unclear whether it extends to the adversarial setting.
  We introduce Dig-DEC, a model-free DEC that removes optimism and drives
exploration purely by information gain. Dig-DEC is always no larger than
optimistic DEC and can be much smaller in special cases. Importantly, the
removal of optimism allows it to handle adversarial environments without
explicit reward estimators. By applying Dig-DEC to hybrid MDPs with stochastic
transitions and adversarial rewards, we obtain the first model-free regret
bounds for hybrid MDPs with bandit feedback under several general transition
structures, resolving the main open problem left by Liu et al. (2025).
  We also improve the online function-estimation procedure in model-free
learning: For average estimation error minimization, we refine the estimator in
Foster et al. (2023b) to achieve sharper concentration, improving their regret
bounds from $T^{3/4}$ to $T^{2/3}$ (on-policy) and from $T^{5/6}$ to $T^{7/9}$
(off-policy). For squared error minimization in Bellman-complete MDPs, we
redesign their two-timescale procedure, improving the regret bound from
$T^{2/3}$ to $\sqrt{T}$. This is the first time a DEC-based method achieves
performance matching that of optimism-based approaches (Jin et al., 2021; Xie
et al., 2023) in Bellman-complete MDPs.

TL;DR: 提出了ACPO框架，通过难度感知课程和基于归因的策略优化，解决RLVR中探索与利用的平衡问题，显著提升复杂推理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前强化学习与可验证奖励方法在平衡探索与利用方面存在困难，导致中间步骤信用分配不准确和过早熵崩溃，限制了模型性能。

Method: 引入基于归因的策略优化框架，包含轨迹语义分割和基于归因的表征来动态调节策略熵，同时使用因子化奖励系统精确量化每个推理步骤的层次贡献。

Result: 在AIME、MATH和AMC等挑战性基准测试中，ACPO显著优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: ACPO通过改进探索和利用的平衡，有效解决了RLVR中的关键问题，为复杂推理任务提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: While Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) enhances complex
reasoning in LLMs, current methods struggle to balance exploration and
exploitation. This leads to critical issues like inaccurate credit assignment
for intermediate steps and premature entropy collapse, limiting model
performance. To address this, we introduce Attribution-based Contribution to
Policy Optimization (ACPO), a phased framework that incorporates a
difficulty-aware curriculum. ACPO improves exploration by using trajectory
semantic segmentation and an attribution-based representation to dynamically
regulate policy entropy, thus mitigating its collapse. Concurrently, it
enhances exploitation with a factorized reward system that precisely quantifies
the hierarchical contribution of each reasoning step, ensuring accurate credit
assignment. Extensive experiments on challenging benchmarks, including AIME,
MATH, and AMC, demonstrate that ACPO significantly outperforms existing
state-of-the-art approaches.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个新颖的频域分析框架，将多臂老虎机问题重新表述为信号处理问题，揭示了UCB算法中置信边界项在频域中等效于对不确定频谱分量的时变增益。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多臂老虎机分析主要从时域和累积遗憾角度进行，难以刻画学习过程的动态特性，需要新的分析框架来更好理解探索与利用的权衡。

Method: 构建频域老虎机模型，将每个臂的奖励估计视为频谱分量，不确定性对应分量频率，将老虎机算法解释为自适应滤波器，并证明UCB算法置信边界在频域的等价性。

Result: 证明了UCB算法置信边界在频域中等效于对不确定频谱分量的时变增益，该增益与访问次数的平方根成反比，并推导了关于探索率衰减的有限时间动态边界。

Conclusion: 该理论不仅为经典算法提供了新颖直观的物理解释，还为设计具有自适应参数调整的下一代算法奠定了严格的理论基础。

Abstract: The stochastic multi-armed bandit (MAB) problem is one of the most
fundamental models in sequential decision-making, with the core challenge being
the trade-off between exploration and exploitation. Although algorithms such as
Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) and Thompson Sampling, along with their regret
theories, are well-established, existing analyses primarily operate from a
time-domain and cumulative regret perspective, struggling to characterize the
dynamic nature of the learning process. This paper proposes a novel
frequency-domain analysis framework, reformulating the bandit process as a
signal processing problem. Within this framework, the reward estimate of each
arm is viewed as a spectral component, with its uncertainty corresponding to
the component's frequency, and the bandit algorithm is interpreted as an
adaptive filter. We construct a formal Frequency-Domain Bandit Model and prove
the main theorem: the confidence bound term in the UCB algorithm is equivalent
in the frequency domain to a time-varying gain applied to uncertain spectral
components, a gain inversely proportional to the square root of the visit
count. Based on this, we further derive finite-time dynamic bounds concerning
the exploration rate decay. This theory not only provides a novel and intuitive
physical interpretation for classical algorithms but also lays a rigorous
theoretical foundation for designing next-generation algorithms with adaptive
parameter adjustment.

Method: 建立受车辆速度、密度和资源预留间隔影响的AoI计算模型，设计双路径优化方案：DDPG基于状态空间和奖励函数，LLM利用上下文学习生成最优参数配置。

Result: 实验结果显示LLM在积累少量示例后能显著降低AoI且无需模型训练，DDPG方法在训练后性能更稳定。

Conclusion: LLM和DDPG结合的双路径优化方案能有效改善车联网中的信息年龄性能，LLM适合快速部署，DDPG提供稳定性能。

Abstract: Addressing the problem of Age of Information (AoI) deterioration caused by
packet collisions and vehicle speed-related channel uncertainties in
Semi-Persistent Scheduling (SPS) for the Internet of Vehicles (IoV), this
letter proposes an optimization approach based on Large Language Models (LLM)
and Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG). First, an AoI calculation model
influenced by vehicle speed, vehicle density, and Resource Reservation Interval
(RRI) is established, followed by the design of a dual-path optimization
scheme. The DDPG is guided by the state space and reward function, while the
LLM leverages contextual learning to generate optimal parameter configurations.
Experimental results demonstrate that LLM can significantly reduce AoI after
accumulating a small number of exemplars without requiring model training,
whereas the DDPG method achieves more stable performance after training.

TL;DR: 提出了一种针对小地球数据的时空预测方法，通过量化时空模式并利用表格基础模型，在不同场景下实现准确预测，优于传统深度学习和基础模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 小地球数据具有有限的短期监测变异性和时空相关性，传统深度学习需要针对不同场景进行专门训练，而基础模型存在对预训练分布全局均值的预测偏差问题。

Method: 通过表征和量化小地球数据的时空模式，然后利用表格基础模型进行跨场景的准确预测。

Result: 在三种典型场景的比较中，该方法在大多数情况下比图深度学习模型（T-GCN）和表格基础模型（TabPFN）具有更高的准确性，并表现出更强的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该方法为时空相关的小地球数据预测提供了一种简单而鲁棒的解决方案，能够有效应对不同场景的预测需求。

Abstract: Small Earth data are geoscience observations with limited short-term
monitoring variability, providing sparse but meaningful measurements, typically
exhibiting spatiotemporal correlations. Spatiotemporal forecasting on such data
is crucial for understanding geoscientific processes despite their small scale.
However, conventional deep learning models for spatiotemporal forecasting
requires task-specific training for different scenarios. Foundation models do
not need task-specific training, but they often exhibit forecasting bias toward
the global mean of the pretraining distribution. Here we propose a simple and
robust approach for spatiotemporally correlated small Earth data forecasting.
The essential idea is to characterize and quantify spatiotemporal patterns of
small Earth data and then utilize tabular foundation models for accurate
forecasting across different scenarios. Comparative results across three
typical scenarios demonstrate that our forecasting approach achieves superior
accuracy compared to the graph deep learning model (T-GCN) and tabular
foundation model (TabPFN) in the majority of instances, exhibiting stronger
robustness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统PINNs在处理多尺度问题时面临的挑战，通过动态域分解来更好地捕捉解的不同尺度特征，避免陷入局部极小值并减少超参数调优需求。

Method: 基于经典网格细化技术，在训练过程中动态调整域分解：现有子域自适应调整以匹配解的特征，同时在残差损失高的区域引入新的子域以增强表达能力。

Result: AB-PINNs在多种复杂多尺度偏微分方程求解中表现出有效性，能够更好地处理多尺度问题并提高求解精度。

Conclusion: 自适应基PINNs提供了一种灵活的域分解方法，特别适用于多尺度问题，能够动态适应解的特征并减少对静态域分解方法的依赖。

Abstract: We introduce adaptive-basis physics-informed neural networks (AB-PINNs), a
novel approach to domain decomposition for training PINNs in which existing
subdomains dynamically adapt to the intrinsic features of the unknown solution.
Drawing inspiration from classical mesh refinement techniques, we also modify
the domain decomposition on-the-fly throughout training by introducing new
subdomains in regions of high residual loss, thereby providing additional
expressive power where the solution of the differential equation is challenging
to represent. Our flexible approach to domain decomposition is well-suited for
multiscale problems, as different subdomains can learn to capture different
scales of the underlying solution. Moreover, the ability to introduce new
subdomains during training helps prevent convergence to unwanted local minima
and can reduce the need for extensive hyperparameter tuning compared to static
domain decomposition approaches. Throughout, we present comprehensive numerical
results which demonstrate the effectiveness of AB-PINNs at solving a variety of
complex multiscale partial differential equations.

Motivation: 传统证据深度学习方法使用静态超参数进行不确定性校准，在动态数据分布下适应性差，导致高风险决策任务中校准和泛化性能不佳。

Method: 采用双层优化方法：内层通过动态配置的损失函数更新模型参数；外层使用策略网络基于多目标奖励优化KL散度系数和类别特定的狄利克雷先验强度。

Result: 实验结果表明MPC显著提升了模型预测的可靠性和校准性，在不确定性校准、预测准确性和基于置信度的样本拒绝后性能保持方面均有改进。

Conclusion: MPC框架通过动态元学习实现了更好的不确定性建模，可学习的狄利克雷先验能够灵活适应类别分布和训练动态，显著提升了模型在高风险决策任务中的可靠性。

Abstract: Traditional Evidence Deep Learning (EDL) methods rely on static
hyperparameter for uncertainty calibration, limiting their adaptability in
dynamic data distributions, which results in poor calibration and
generalization in high-risk decision-making tasks. To address this limitation,
we propose the Meta-Policy Controller (MPC), a dynamic meta-learning framework
that adjusts the KL divergence coefficient and Dirichlet prior strengths for
optimal uncertainty modeling. Specifically, MPC employs a bi-level optimization
approach: in the inner loop, model parameters are updated through a dynamically
configured loss function that adapts to the current training state; in the
outer loop, a policy network optimizes the KL divergence coefficient and
class-specific Dirichlet prior strengths based on multi-objective rewards
balancing prediction accuracy and uncertainty quality. Unlike previous methods
with fixed priors, our learnable Dirichlet prior enables flexible adaptation to
class distributions and training dynamics. Extensive experimental results show
that MPC significantly enhances the reliability and calibration of model
predictions across various tasks, improving uncertainty calibration, prediction
accuracy, and performance retention after confidence-based sample rejection.

Motivation: 现实世界时间序列数据存在非平稳行为、机制转换和时间变化的噪声，这些会降低标准回归模型的鲁棒性。

Method: VARNN在传统前馈预测器基础上增加了学习到的误差记忆状态，该状态从短期上下文步骤的残差中更新，作为变异性和漂移的信号，并调节当前时间步的最终预测。

Result: 在多个领域数据集上的实验表明，VARNN实现了优越性能，在漂移和波动环境下获得更低的测试MSE，且计算开销最小。

Conclusion: VARNN模型在漂移和波动环境下提供鲁棒预测，显示出作为时间序列学习框架的潜力。

Abstract: Real-world time series data exhibit non-stationary behavior, regime shifts,
and temporally varying noise (heteroscedastic) that degrade the robustness of
standard regression models. We introduce the Variability-Aware Recursive Neural
Network (VARNN), a novel residual-aware architecture for supervised time-series
regression that learns an explicit error memory from recent prediction
residuals and uses it to recalibrate subsequent predictions. VARNN augments a
feed-forward predictor with a learned error-memory state that is updated from
residuals over a short context steps as a signal of variability and drift, and
then conditions the final prediction at the current time step. Across diverse
dataset domains, appliance energy, healthcare, and environmental monitoring,
experimental results demonstrate VARNN achieves superior performance and
attains lower test MSE with minimal computational overhead over static,
dynamic, and recurrent baselines. Our findings show that the VARNN model offers
robust predictions under a drift and volatility environment, highlighting its
potential as a promising framework for time-series learning.

Abstract: Text-attributed graphs (TAGs) have emerged as a powerful representation that
combines structural connections with fine-grained semantics, supporting a wide
range of data-centric applications. However, the performance of graph neural
networks (GNNs) on TAGs is highly sensitive to input quality. Our empirical
study shows that both traditional GNNs and LLM-enhanced GNNs suffer significant
degradation across nine representative scenarios of sparsity, noise, and
imbalance, highlighting graph quality as a critical bottleneck. Existing
approaches mainly focus on improving model architectures, while neglecting
systematic optimization of TAG data itself, leading to limited effectiveness in
practice. To address this gap, we propose LAGA (Large Language and Graph
Agent), a unified multi-agent framework that treats graph quality control as a
first-class, data-centric problem. LAGA integrates four collaborative
agents-detection, planning, action, and evaluation-into an automated closed
loop. At its core, the action agent employs a dual-encoder and tri-objective
design to capture complementary information across modalities and perform
holistic graph quality enhancement. Experiments across nine scenarios show that
LAGA improves graph quality and achieves state-of-the-art performance across
various tasks and backbones, validating data-centric quality optimization as
key to reliable TAGs and robust graph learning.

Abstract: Learning with high-resource data has demonstrated substantial success in
artificial intelligence (AI); however, the costs associated with data

investigate a suite of optimization strategies tailored for low-resource data
learning, including gradient-informed optimization, meta-iteration
optimization, geometry-aware optimization, and LLMs-powered optimization.
Furthermore, we provide a comprehensive overview of multiple learning paradigms
that can benefit from low-resource data, including domain transfer,
reinforcement feedback, and hierarchical structure modeling. Finally, we
conclude our analysis and investigation by summarizing the key findings and
highlighting their implications for learning with low-resource data.

Abstract: Bayesian Optimisation (BO) is a powerful tool for optimising expensive
blackbox functions but its effectiveness diminishes in highdimensional spaces
due to sparse data and poor surrogate model scalability While Variational
Autoencoder (VAE) based approaches address this by learning low-dimensional
latent representations the reconstructionbased objective function often brings
the functional distribution mismatch between the latent space and original
space leading to suboptimal optimisation performance In this paper we first
analyse the reason why reconstructiononly loss may lead to distribution
mismatch and then propose HiBBO a novel BO framework that introduces the space
consistency into the latent space construction in VAE using HiPPO - a method
for longterm sequence modelling - to reduce the functional distribution
mismatch between the latent space and original space Experiments on
highdimensional benchmark tasks demonstrate that HiBBO outperforms existing
VAEBO methods in convergence speed and solution quality Our work bridges the
gap between high-dimensional sequence representation learning and efficient
Bayesian Optimisation enabling broader applications in neural architecture

Conclusion: 学习优化器能够内在地学习正则化属性，挑战了传统显式优化目标正则化的必要性。

Abstract: Learned Optimizers (LOs), a type of Meta-learning, have gained traction due
to their ability to be parameterized and trained for efficient optimization.
Traditional gradient-based methods incorporate explicit regularization
techniques such as Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM), Gradient-norm Aware
Minimization (GAM), and Gap-guided Sharpness-Aware Minimization (GSAM) to
enhance generalization and convergence. In this work, we explore a fundamental
question: \textbf{Can regularizers be learned?} We empirically demonstrate that
LOs can be trained to learn and internalize the effects of traditional
regularization techniques without explicitly applying them to the objective
function. We validate this through extensive experiments on standard benchmarks
(including MNIST, FMNIST, CIFAR and Neural Networks such as MLP, MLP-Relu and
CNN), comparing LOs trained with and without access to explicit regularizers.
Regularized LOs consistently outperform their unregularized counterparts in
terms of test accuracy and generalization. Furthermore, we show that LOs retain
and transfer these regularization effects to new optimization tasks by
inherently seeking minima similar to those targeted by these regularizers. Our
results suggest that LOs can inherently learn regularization properties,
\textit{challenging the conventional necessity of explicit optimizee loss
regularization.

Motivation: RLVR受限于有限的标注样本，而RLIR虽然能在无标签环境下持续扩展，但性能和稳定性落后于RLVR。主要问题是模型倾向于高估高置信度轨迹，导致有偏和不稳定的奖励估计。

Method: 提出RLER方法：1）集成多个模型；2）自适应奖励插值；3）轨迹选择。通过三个偏差指标（ρ_noise、ρ_selfbias、ρ_symbias）来表征系统偏差。

Result: RLER相比RLIR提升了13.6%，仅比RLVR低3.6%，在无标签样本上实现了稳定扩展，具有很高的应用价值。

Conclusion: RLER通过集成模型和自适应策略有效缓解了系统偏差问题，为无标签环境下的强化学习提供了稳定可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) scales the reasoning
ability of large language models (LLMs) but remains bottlenecked by limited
labeled samples for continued data scaling. Reinforcement learning with
intrinsic rewards (RLIR), where the policy model assigns rewards to its own
rollouts, enables sustainable scaling in unlabeled settings, yet its
performance and stability lag behind RLVR. We trace this gap to a system bias:
the model tends to overestimate its high-confidence rollouts, leading to biased
and unstable reward estimation. This bias accumulates as training progresses,
with deviations from the oracle drifting toward over-reward, causing unstable
training. We characterize this bias using three metrics: $\rho_{\text{noise}}$,
$\rho_{\text{selfbias}}$, and $\rho_{\text{symbias}}$. We find that
$\rho_{\text{noise}}$ and $\rho_{\text{symbias}}$ impact convergence, while
$\rho_{\text{selfbias}}$ amplifies both correct and incorrect updates, leading
to instability. To mitigate this, we propose reinforcement learning with
ensembled rewards (RLER), which aggregates diverse models and adapts reward
interpolation and rollout selection. Extensive experiments show that RLER
improves by +13.6% over RLIR and is only 3.6% below RLVR, achieving stable
scaling on unlabeled samples, making it highly applicable.

*Kamel Alrashedy,Vriksha Srihari,Zulfiqar Zaidi,Ridam Srivastava,Pradyumna Tambwekar,Matthew Gombolay*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了Constraints-of-Thought (Const-o-T)框架，通过(intent, constraint)对来结构化引导MCTS搜索，解决LLMs在多步规划中难以满足符号约束和用户意图的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法如CoT、ToT等虽然扩展了搜索空间，但经常产生不可行动作或幻觉步骤，无法确保规划与高层用户意图对齐并满足符号约束。

Method: 使用(intent, constraint)对作为结构化先验，集成到MCTS中，通过约束剪枝不可行分支并引导搜索朝向语义有效动作。

Result: 在Risk游戏、CAD代码生成和算术推理三个领域中，该方法优于基线，获得更高准确率和更强的结构对齐。

Conclusion: Const-o-T为约束引导推理提供了可泛化的基础，使LLMs能够进行更高效、约束对齐和领域自适应的规划。

Abstract: While researchers have made significant progress in enabling large language
models (LLMs) to perform multi-step planning, LLMs struggle to ensure that
those plans align with high-level user intent and satisfy symbolic constraints,
especially in complex, multi-step domains. Existing reasoning approaches such
as Chain-of-Thought (CoT), Tree-of-Thought (ToT), and verifier-augmented
methods, expand the search space but often yield infeasible actions or
hallucinated steps. To overcome these limitations, we propose
Constraints-of-Thought (Const-o-T), a framework that provides a structured
prior that enables Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) focus search on semantically
meaningful paths. Each reasoning step is represented as an (intent, constraint)
pair, which serves both to compress the search space and enforce validity.
Unlike prior methods that merely generate reasoning traces or validate outputs
post hoc, Const-o-T uses (intent, constraint)pairs to actively focus the search
toward feasible and meaningful plans. We integrate Const-o-T into MCTS using a
structured representation of intent-constraint pairs constraints prune
infeasible branches and guide exploration toward semantically valid actions,
improving planning efficiency and verifiable decision-making. We demonstrate
across three domains Risk game, CAD code generation, and arithmetic reasoning
that our approach outperforms baselines, yielding higher accuracy and stronger
structural alignment. Our contribution is to demonstrate that Const-of-T offers
a generalizable foundation for constraint-guided reasoning, enabling more
efficient, constraint-aligned, and domain-adaptable planning with LLMs.

TL;DR: PlatformX是一个完全自动化的硬件感知神经架构搜索框架，通过集成能量驱动的搜索空间、可转移的核级能量预测器、帕累托多目标搜索算法和高分辨率运行时能量分析系统，显著降低了搜索开销，同时保持准确性和能量保真度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的硬件感知神经架构搜索方法由于高时间成本、大量手动分析和在不同硬件平台上扩展性差，在实际部署中仍不实用。

Method: PlatformX集成了四个关键组件：能量驱动的搜索空间、可跨设备转移的核级能量预测器、基于帕累托的多目标搜索算法，以及使用外部监视器自动进行设备上功率测量的高分辨率运行时能量分析系统。

Result: 在多个移动平台上评估显示，PlatformX显著减少了搜索开销，同时保持准确性和能量保真度。它识别出的模型准确率高达0.94，每次推理能耗低至0.16 mJ，在准确性和效率上都优于MobileNet-V2。

Conclusion: PlatformX是一个完全自动化和可转移的HW-NAS框架，能够克服现有方法的局限性，为边缘设备设计高效的深度神经网络提供实用解决方案。

Abstract: Hardware-Aware Neural Architecture Search (HW-NAS) has emerged as a powerful
tool for designing efficient deep neural networks (DNNs) tailored to edge
devices. However, existing methods remain largely impractical for real-world
deployment due to their high time cost, extensive manual profiling, and poor
scalability across diverse hardware platforms with complex, device-specific
energy behavior. In this paper, we present PlatformX, a fully automated and
transferable HW-NAS framework designed to overcome these limitations. PlatformX
integrates four key components: (i) an energy-driven search space that expands
conventional NAS design by incorporating energy-critical configurations,
enabling exploration of high-efficiency architectures; (ii) a transferable
kernel-level energy predictor across devices and incrementally refined with
minimal on-device samples; (iii) a Pareto-based multi-objective search
algorithm that balances energy and accuracy to identify optimal trade-offs; and
(iv) a high-resolution runtime energy profiling system that automates on-device
power measurement using external monitors without human intervention. We
evaluate PlatformX across multiple mobile platforms, showing that it
significantly reduces search overhead while preserving accuracy and energy
fidelity. It identifies models with up to 0.94 accuracy or as little as 0.16 mJ
per inference, both outperforming MobileNet-V2 in accuracy and efficiency. Code

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于贝叶斯变分学习的统一框架SQS，同时进行剪枝和低位量化，在保持性能的同时实现比现有方法更高的压缩率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常单独使用权重剪枝或低位量化，导致压缩率不理想。需要一种能同时进行剪枝和量化的统一方法来获得更高的压缩率。

Method: 使用spike-and-slab先验诱导稀疏性，采用高斯混合模型(GMM)建模量化权重以实现低位精度，通过贝叶斯变分学习统一框架。

Result: 在ResNet、BERT-base、Llama3和Qwen2.5模型上的实验表明，该方法在保持可比性能下降的同时，压缩率高于一系列现有方法。

Conclusion: SQS框架通过同时进行剪枝和量化，在保持模型性能的同时实现了更高的压缩率，为资源受限设备上的模型部署提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Compressing large-scale neural networks is essential for deploying models on
resource-constrained devices. Most existing methods adopt weight pruning or
low-bit quantization individually, often resulting in suboptimal compression
rates to preserve acceptable performance drops. We introduce a unified
framework for simultaneous pruning and low-bit quantization via Bayesian
variational learning (SQS), which achieves higher compression rates than prior
baselines while maintaining comparable performance. The key idea is to employ a
spike-and-slab prior to inducing sparsity and model quantized weights using
Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) to enable low-bit precision. In theory, we
provide the consistent result of our proposed variational approach to a sparse
and quantized deep neural network. Extensive experiments on compressing ResNet,
BERT-base, Llama3, and Qwen2.5 models show that our method achieves higher
compression rates than a line of existing methods with comparable performance
drops.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该研究首次探讨了在噪声遗忘数据集下的LLM遗忘问题，发现即使遗忘数据被扰动或质量较低，只要核心语义信号保留，遗忘方法仍能保持鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的遗忘数据往往是低质量、合成改写或带有水印的，而现有遗忘方法假设访问干净、定义明确的遗忘数据，这引发了遗忘可靠性的担忧。

Method: 系统性地在噪声遗忘数据集上对最先进的LLM遗忘方法RMU和NPO进行基准测试，并提出基于显著性的解释框架。

Result: 研究发现遗忘对扰动具有惊人的鲁棒性，关键语义成分在表面形式大幅变化时仍保持一致的遗忘驱动作用。

Conclusion: 遗忘算法主要受深层语义线索而非浅层词汇模式引导，这解释了其在噪声遗忘数据下的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable generative capabilities but
raise ethical and security concerns by memorizing sensitive data, reinforcing
biases, and producing harmful content. These risks have spurred interest in LLM
unlearning, the task of removing knowledge associated with undesirable data
from pre-trained models. However, most existing methods assume access to clean,
well-defined forget data samples, whereas real-world forget data could often be
low-quality, synthetically rewritten, or watermarked, casting doubt on the
reliability of unlearning. This work presents the first study of unlearning
under perturbed or low-fidelity forget data, referred to as noisy forget sets.
By systematically benchmarking state-of-the-art LLM unlearning methods, RMU and
NPO, on such noisy forget sets, we find that unlearning remains surprisingly
robust to perturbations, provided that core semantic signals are preserved. To
explain this robustness, we propose a saliency-based interpretation: key
semantic components that drive forgetting remain consistently influential
despite substantial variation in surface form. This suggests that unlearning
algorithms are primarily guided by deep semantic cues rather than shallow
lexical patterns.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Value-State Gated Attention (VGA)机制，通过直接从值向量计算可学习门控来打破注意力与值状态之间的恶性循环，有效缓解极端token现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer架构中的极端token现象（如注意力汇和值状态流失）会降低模型性能、量化保真度和可解释性，这些问题的根源在于注意力与接近零值状态之间的相互强化机制。

Method: VGA引入基于值向量的可学习门控机制，通过理论分析证明直接对值状态进行门控比基于输入嵌入的门控方法更有效，能够解耦值和注意力分数的更新。

Result: 实验表明VGA显著减轻了注意力汇的形成并稳定了值状态范数，带来了性能提升、稳健的量化保真度和增强的模型可解释性。

Conclusion: VGA提供了一种简单而有效的架构机制，能够高效执行'无操作'注意力，打破注意力与值状态之间的恶性循环，改善模型性能。

Abstract: Large models based on the Transformer architecture are susceptible to
extreme-token phenomena, such as attention sinks and value-state drains. These
issues, which degrade model performance, quantization fidelity, and
interpretability, arise from a problematic mutual reinforcement mechanism where
the model learns an inefficient 'no-op' behavior by focusing attention on
tokens with near-zero value states. In this paper, we propose Value-State Gated
Attention (VGA), a simple, dedicated, and stable architectural mechanism for
performing 'no-op' attention efficiently by directly breaking this cycle. VGA
introduces a learnable, data-dependent gate, computed directly from the value
vectors (V), to modulate the output. Through a theoretical analysis of the
underlying gradients, we show that gating the value-state with a function of
itself is more effective at decoupling value and attention score updates than
prior methods that gate on input embeddings. This creates a direct regulatory
pathway that allows the model to suppress a token's contribution based on its
emergent value representation. Our experiments demonstrate that VGA
significantly mitigates the formation of attention sinks and stabilizes
value-state norms, leading to improved performance, robust quantization
fidelity, and enhanced model interpretability.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Slim Scheduler是一个混合调度框架，结合PPO强化学习和贪心调度器，用于可瘦身模型的分布式推理调度，在精度、延迟和能耗之间实现平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有神经网络调度研究主要关注固定宽度的静态端到端模型，忽略了适应异构硬件和动态运行条件的动态方法。

Method: 采用分层设计：本地贪心调度器处理请求批处理和实例扩展，PPO路由器学习全局路由策略（设备选择、宽度比例、批配置）。

Result: 相比随机任务分配基线，在精度降至最瘦模型（70.3%）时，平均延迟减少96.45%，能耗减少97.31%；在提高精度的同时仍能减少平均延迟和能耗。

Conclusion: 该分层设计降低了搜索空间复杂度，缓解了对特定硬件的过拟合，平衡了效率和吞吐量。

Abstract: Most neural network scheduling research focuses on optimizing static,
end-to-end models of fixed width, overlooking dynamic approaches that adapt to
heterogeneous hardware and fluctuating runtime conditions. We present Slim
Scheduler, a hybrid scheduling framework that integrates a Proximal Policy
Optimization (PPO) reinforcement learning policy with algorithmic, greedy
schedulers to coordinate distributed inference for slimmable models. Each
server runs a local greedy scheduler that batches compatible requests and
manages instance scaling based on VRAM and utilization constraints, while the
PPO router learns global routing policies for device selection, width ratio,
and batch configuration. This hierarchical design reduces search space
complexity, mitigates overfitting to specific hardware, and balances efficiency
and throughput. Compared to a purely randomized task distribution baseline,
Slim Scheduler can achieve various accuracy and latency trade-offs such as: A
96.45% reduction in mean latency and a 97.31% reduction in energy usage
dropping accuracy to the slimmest model available (70.3%). It can then
accomplish an overall reduction in average latency plus energy consumption with
an increase in accuracy at the cost of higher standard deviations of said
latency and energy, effecting overall task throughput.

TL;DR: MagicDock是一个用于从头配体设计的框架，通过梯度反演和可微分表面建模解决现有方法的局限性，在9个场景中相比SOTA基线平均提升27.1%和11.7%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有从头配体设计方法存在的三个主要问题：伪从头设计、有限的对接建模和僵化的配体类型限制。

Method: 采用梯度反演框架和可微分表面建模，通过结合受体和配体的通用对接知识，利用结合预测的反向梯度流迭代指导配体生成，并使用可学习的3D点云表示精确捕捉结合细节。

Result: 在9个不同场景的广泛实验中，MagicDock相比专门用于蛋白质或分子配体设计的SOTA基线分别实现了27.1%和11.7%的平均改进。

Conclusion: MagicDock通过创新的梯度反演和可微分表面建模方法，有效解决了从头配体设计的关键挑战，具有广泛的应用前景。

Abstract: De novo ligand design is a fundamental task that seeks to generate protein or
molecule candidates that can effectively dock with protein receptors and
achieve strong binding affinity entirely from scratch. It holds paramount
significance for a wide spectrum of biomedical applications. However, most
existing studies are constrained by the \textbf{Pseudo De Novo},
\textbf{Limited Docking Modeling}, and \textbf{Inflexible Ligand Type}. To
address these issues, we propose MagicDock, a forward-looking framework
grounded in the progressive pipeline and differentiable surface modeling. (1)
We adopt a well-designed gradient inversion framework. To begin with, general
docking knowledge of receptors and ligands is incorporated into the backbone
model. Subsequently, the docking knowledge is instantiated as reverse gradient
flows by binding prediction, which iteratively guide the de novo generation of
ligands. (2) We emphasize differentiable surface modeling in the docking
process, leveraging learnable 3D point-cloud representations to precisely
capture binding details, thereby ensuring that the generated ligands preserve
docking validity through direct and interpretable spatial fingerprints. (3) We
introduce customized designs for different ligand types and integrate them into
a unified gradient inversion framework with flexible triggers, thereby ensuring
broad applicability. Moreover, we provide rigorous theoretical guarantees for
each component of MagicDock. Extensive experiments across 9 scenarios
demonstrate that MagicDock achieves average improvements of 27.1\% and 11.7\%
over SOTA baselines specialized for protein or molecule ligand design,
respectively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着机器学习性能提升，计算需求激增导致能耗和环境问题日益严重，需要评估硬件优化、算法优化和碳优化等策略能否实现可持续的ML模型训练。

Method: 通过估计近十年来著名AI系统训练的环境影响，重点关注显卡的生命周期分析，考察能源消耗和环境影响趋势。

Result: 显卡生产影响稳步增加，模型训练能耗呈指数增长，即使采用地理位置转移等减排策略，优化策略也无法缓解训练带来的环境影响，存在反弹效应。

Conclusion: 仅靠提高效率无法确保ML的可持续性，缓解AI环境影响还需要减少AI活动，质疑资源密集型训练的规模和频率，必须考虑硬件的整个生命周期而非仅使用阶段。

Abstract: Recent Machine Learning (ML) approaches have shown increased performance on
benchmarks but at the cost of escalating computational demands. Hardware,
algorithmic and carbon optimizations have been proposed to curb energy
consumption and environmental impacts. Can these strategies lead to sustainable
ML model training? Here, we estimate the environmental impacts associated with
training notable AI systems over the last decade, including Large Language
Models, with a focus on the life cycle of graphics cards. Our analysis reveals
two critical trends: First, the impacts of graphics cards production have
increased steadily over this period; Second, energy consumption and
environmental impacts associated with training ML models have increased
exponentially, even when considering reduction strategies such as location
shifting to places with less carbon intensive electricity mixes. Optimization
strategies do not mitigate the impacts induced by model training, evidencing
rebound effect. We show that the impacts of hardware must be considered over
the entire life cycle rather than the sole use phase in order to avoid impact
shifting. Our study demonstrates that increasing efficiency alone cannot ensure
sustainability in ML. Mitigating the environmental impact of AI also requires
reducing AI activities and questioning the scale and frequency of
resource-intensive training.

Motivation: 当前语言模型防御评估方法存在缺陷，要么使用静态攻击字符串，要么使用计算能力较弱的优化方法，没有考虑自适应攻击者的威胁。

Method: 通过系统调整和扩展通用优化技术（梯度下降、强化学习、随机搜索和人工引导探索）来构建自适应攻击策略。

Result: 成功绕过了12种基于不同技术的近期防御系统，大多数防御的攻击成功率超过90%，而原始报告显示这些防御的攻击成功率接近零。

Conclusion: 未来的防御工作必须考虑更强的攻击方法，如本文描述的自适应攻击，才能做出可靠且令人信服的鲁棒性声明。

Abstract: How should we evaluate the robustness of language model defenses? Current
defenses against jailbreaks and prompt injections (which aim to prevent an
attacker from eliciting harmful knowledge or remotely triggering malicious
actions, respectively) are typically evaluated either against a static set of
harmful attack strings, or against computationally weak optimization methods
that were not designed with the defense in mind. We argue that this evaluation
process is flawed.
  Instead, we should evaluate defenses against adaptive attackers who
explicitly modify their attack strategy to counter a defense's design while
spending considerable resources to optimize their objective. By systematically
tuning and scaling general optimization techniques-gradient descent,
reinforcement learning, random search, and human-guided exploration-we bypass
12 recent defenses (based on a diverse set of techniques) with attack success
rate above 90% for most; importantly, the majority of defenses originally
reported near-zero attack success rates. We believe that future defense work
must consider stronger attacks, such as the ones we describe, in order to make
reliable and convincing claims of robustness.

TL;DR: 本文从收敛到任意点的假设出发，论证不同优化器作为特征值过滤器的作用，并提出两种促进更宽最小值的新算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于深度神经网络训练中各种优化器往往能找到接近全局最优解的观察，研究从收敛假设出发探讨优化器的特征值过滤特性。

Method: 使用广义Hadamard-Perron稳定流形定理，提出两种具有增强特征值过滤能力的新算法，适用于一般半代数C^2函数。

Result: 理论分析和数值实验表明，标准梯度下降法避免最尖锐最小值，而SAM算法更积极地偏好更宽的盆地，新算法能有效促进更宽最小值。

Conclusion: 不同优化器通过其特征值过滤特性影响收敛点的选择，提出的新算法能更有效地促进宽最小值，提升模型泛化能力。

Abstract: Ample empirical evidence in deep neural network training suggests that a
variety of optimizers tend to find nearly global optima. In this article, we
adopt the reversed perspective that convergence to an arbitrary point is
assumed rather than proven, focusing on the consequences of this assumption.
From this viewpoint, in line with recent advances on the edge-of-stability
phenomenon, we argue that different optimizers effectively act as eigenvalue
filters determined by their hyperparameters. Specifically, the standard
gradient descent method inherently avoids the sharpest minima, whereas
Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) algorithms go even further by actively
favoring wider basins. Inspired by these insights, we propose two novel
algorithms that exhibit enhanced eigenvalue filtering, effectively promoting
wider minima. Our theoretical analysis leverages a generalized Hadamard--Perron
stable manifold theorem and applies to general semialgebraic $C^2$ functions,
without requiring additional non-degeneracy conditions or global Lipschitz
bound assumptions. We support our conclusions with numerical experiments on
feed-forward neural networks.

Result: 实验显示IGCARL比最先进方法成功率提高至少27.9%，显著增强对抗攻击的鲁棒性和安全性

Conclusion: IGCARL有效提升了DRL自动驾驶的安全性和可靠性，解决了现有方法的局限性

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has demonstrated remarkable success in
developing autonomous driving policies. However, its vulnerability to
adversarial attacks remains a critical barrier to real-world deployment.
Although existing robust methods have achieved success, they still suffer from
three key issues: (i) these methods are trained against myopic adversarial
attacks, limiting their abilities to respond to more strategic threats, (ii)
they have trouble causing truly safety-critical events (e.g., collisions), but
instead often result in minor consequences, and (iii) these methods can
introduce learning instability and policy drift during training due to the lack
of robust constraints. To address these issues, we propose Intelligent
General-sum Constrained Adversarial Reinforcement Learning (IGCARL), a novel
robust autonomous driving approach that consists of a strategic targeted
adversary and a robust driving agent. The strategic targeted adversary is
designed to leverage the temporal decision-making capabilities of DRL to
execute strategically coordinated multi-step attacks. In addition, it
explicitly focuses on inducing safety-critical events by adopting a general-sum
objective. The robust driving agent learns by interacting with the adversary to
develop a robust autonomous driving policy against adversarial attacks. To
ensure stable learning in adversarial environments and to mitigate policy drift
caused by attacks, the agent is optimized under a constrained formulation.
Extensive experiments show that IGCARL improves the success rate by at least
27.9\% over state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating superior robustness to
adversarial attacks and enhancing the safety and reliability of DRL-based
autonomous driving.

Abstract: Transportation remains a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions,
highlighting the urgency of transitioning toward sustainable alternatives such
as electric vehicles (EVs). Yet, uneven spatial distribution and irregular
utilization of charging infrastructure create challenges for both power grid
stability and investment planning. This study introduces TW-GCN, a
spatio-temporal forecasting framework that combines Graph Convolutional
Networks with temporal architectures to predict EV charging demand in
Tennessee, United States (U.S.). We utilize real-world traffic flows, weather
conditions, and proprietary data provided by one of the largest EV
infrastructure company in the U.S. to capture both spatial dependencies and
temporal dynamics. Extensive experiments across varying lag horizons,
clustering strategies, and sequence lengths reveal that mid-horizon (3-hour)
forecasts achieve the best balance between responsiveness and stability, with
1DCNN consistently outperforming other temporal models. Regional analysis shows
disparities in predictive accuracy across East, Middle, and West Tennessee,
reflecting how station density, population, and local demand variability shape
model performance. The proposed TW-GCN framework advances the integration of
data-driven intelligence into EV infrastructure planning, supporting both
sustainable mobility transitions and resilient grid management.

(CPD), particularly algorithms like ChangeFinder, have been successfully
applied to segment time series and improve anomaly detection by reducing
temporal uncertainty, especially in multivariate environments. In this work, we
explored how the integration of segmentation techniques, combined with a
heterogeneous ensemble, can enhance anomaly detection in an industrial
production context. The results show that applying segmentation as a
pre-processing step before selecting heterogeneous ensemble algorithms provided
a significant advantage in our case study, improving the AUC-ROC metric from
0.8599 (achieved with a PCA and LSTM ensemble) to 0.9760 (achieved with Random
Forest and XGBoost). This improvement is imputable to the ability of
segmentation to reduce temporal ambiguity and facilitate the learning process
of supervised algorithms. In our future work, we intend to assess the benefit
of introducing weighted features derived from the study of change points,
combined with segmentation and the use of heterogeneous ensembles, to further
optimize model performance in early anomaly detection.

*Atul Shree,Harshith Jupuru*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FLToP CTC是一种基于帧级token剪枝的CTC解码算法，通过动态剪除低概率token来显著降低计算和内存需求，在LibriSpeech上实现10.5倍运行速度提升和2.78倍内存减少，同时保持WER几乎不变。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CTC解码器在资源受限环境中面临计算和内存瓶颈，在系统中占用高达90%的处理时间，主要由于详尽的token级操作效率低下。

Method: 提出帧级token剪枝算法，使用相对阈值概率指导，在每帧动态消除低概率token，从而减少计算和内存需求。

Result: 在LibriSpeech数据集上，FLToP CTC相比标准CTC解码器实现10.5倍运行速度提升和2.78倍内存减少，同时WER退化可忽略不计。

Conclusion: FLToP CTC有效解决了CTC瓶颈问题，为资源受限环境和实时应用提供了可扩展性，提升了语音识别的可访问性和效率。

Abstract: CTC-based ASR systems face computational and memory bottlenecks in
resource-limited environments. Traditional CTC decoders, requiring up to 90% of
processing time in systems (e.g., wav2vec2-large on L4 GPUs), face
inefficiencies due to exhaustive token-level operations. This paper introduces
Frame Level Token Pruning for Connectionist Temporal Classification (FLToP
CTC), a novel decoding algorithm that employs frame-level token pruning guided
by a relative threshold probability. By dynamically eliminating low-probability
tokens per frame, FLToP CTC reduces compute and memory demands while
maintaining negligible WER degradation. On LibriSpeech, FLToP CTC achieves a
10.5x runtime speedup and 2.78x memory reduction versus standard CTC decoders.
Its simplicity enables seamless integration into CTC decoders across platforms
(CPUs, GPUs, etc.). FLToP CTC addresses CTC bottlenecks, offering scalability
for resource-limited environments and realtime applications, enhancing speech
recognition accessibility and efficiency.

*Yimu Zhang,Yuanshi Liu,Cong Fang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AdaPM是一种自适应训练策略，通过部分动量和偏置校正技术，在保持性能的同时减少90%以上的动量内存使用，可进一步结合二阶统计量技术节省95%优化器状态内存。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在大型语言模型训练中，动量被广泛使用但存储动量会带来内存挑战，需要开发内存高效的优化器。

Method: 提出非均匀动量设计，对大多数块不需要完整动量，并通过偏置校正技术增强部分动量以减少性能损失。

Result: 经验验证表明，该方法在60M到1.5B语言模型预训练、监督微调和RLHF中，减少90%以上动量内存的同时保持效率和性能，结合二阶统计量技术可进一步节省95%优化器状态内存，为GPT-2 1.5B预训练节省超过30%GPU小时。

Conclusion: AdaPM通过自适应部分动量设计实现了内存高效的优化器，在保持性能的同时显著减少内存使用和训练成本。

Abstract: In the training of large language models, momentum is widely used and often
demonstrated to achieve significant acceleration. However, storing momentum
typically presents memory challenges. In this paper, we propose AdaPM, an
adaptive training strategy that leverages partial momentum to implement a
memory-efficient optimizer. To this end, AdaPM utilizes a non-uniform momentum
design: for most blocks, full momentum is not necessary to preserve the
performance of the optimization. In the momentum design of AdaPM, to mitigate
the bias and performance loss caused by partial momentum, we enhance the
partial momentum by a bias correction technique. Empirically, we verify that
our approach reduces memory by over $90\%$ in momentum while maintaining both
efficiency and performance for pretraining various language models ranging from
60M to 1.5B, as well as for supervised fine-tuning and RLHF. AdaPM can further
reduce memory by up to $95\%$ in optimizer states by combining the
memory-efficient technique on the second-order statistic, saving over $30\%$
GPU hours for pretraining GPT-2 1.5B.

TL;DR: 提出了MemLoss方法，通过利用先前生成的对抗样本来改进机器学习模型的对抗训练，在保持干净数据性能的同时提升模型鲁棒性和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的对抗训练方法在提升模型鲁棒性时往往会导致在干净数据上的准确率下降，需要一种平衡的方法来同时保持自然准确率和对抗鲁棒性。

Method: MemLoss方法利用先前训练周期中生成的'记忆对抗样本'，在后续训练中重复使用这些样本来增强模型训练，实现更平衡的性能提升。

Result: 在CIFAR-10等多个数据集上的实验结果表明，该方法相比现有对抗训练方法获得了更好的准确率，同时保持了强大的对抗攻击鲁棒性。

Conclusion: MemLoss通过有效利用历史对抗样本，成功实现了在自然准确率和对抗鲁棒性之间的更好平衡，为对抗训练提供了新的有效方法。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new approach called MemLoss to improve the
adversarial training of machine learning models. MemLoss leverages previously
generated adversarial examples, referred to as 'Memory Adversarial Examples,'
to enhance model robustness and accuracy without compromising performance on
clean data. By using these examples across training epochs, MemLoss provides a
balanced improvement in both natural accuracy and adversarial robustness.
Experimental results on multiple datasets, including CIFAR-10, demonstrate that
our method achieves better accuracy compared to existing adversarial training
methods while maintaining strong robustness against attacks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的成员推断游戏方法，用于高效审计数据记录的近似最坏情况隐私风险，并通过改进DP-SGD算法来减少群体隐私风险差异，提升差分隐私机器学习的隐私保护公平性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统公平性机器学习和差分隐私机器学习在群体隐私保护公平性方面研究不足。现有方法基于平均隐私风险评估，可能低估群体隐私风险及其差异，且最坏情况风险评估方法耗时较长，限制了实际应用。

Method: 1. 引入新型成员推断游戏，高效审计数据记录的近似最坏情况隐私风险；2. 改进标准DP-SGD算法，采用自适应群体特定梯度裁剪策略，灵感来自差分隐私审计研究中的金丝雀设计。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法能够更准确地评估群体隐私风险差异，并通过改进的DP-SGD算法有效提升隐私保护的公平性，为差分隐私机器学习中的公平隐私保护提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: While significant progress has been made in conventional fairness-aware
machine learning (ML) and differentially private ML (DPML), the fairness of
privacy protection across groups remains underexplored. Existing studies have
proposed methods to assess group privacy risks, but these are based on the
average-case privacy risks of data records. Such approaches may underestimate
the group privacy risks, thereby potentially underestimating the disparity
across group privacy risks. Moreover, the current method for assessing the
worst-case privacy risks of data records is time-consuming, limiting their
practical applicability. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel
membership inference game that can efficiently audit the approximate worst-case
privacy risks of data records. Experimental results demonstrate that our method
provides a more stringent measurement of group privacy risks, yielding a
reliable assessment of the disparity in group privacy risks. Furthermore, to
promote privacy protection fairness in DPML, we enhance the standard DP-SGD
algorithm with an adaptive group-specific gradient clipping strategy, inspired
by the design of canaries in differential privacy auditing studies. Extensive
experiments confirm that our algorithm effectively reduces the disparity in
group privacy risks, thereby enhancing the fairness of privacy protection in
DPML.

*Orin Levy,Liad Erez,Alon Cohen,Yishay Mansour*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究了具有延迟反馈的上下文多臂老虎机问题，提出了在有限策略类和一般函数逼近设置下的遗憾最小化算法，并建立了相应的遗憾上界。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在现实世界的在线学习场景中，反馈往往存在延迟，而现有的大多数CMAB算法假设即时反馈。本文旨在解决在对抗性延迟设置下的遗憾最小化问题。

Method: 对于有限策略类，使用直接访问策略类的方法；对于一般函数逼近设置，使用在线最小二乘回归预言机，并提出基于Hedge的Vovk聚合预测器的稳定性分析。

Result: 在有限策略类下获得最优期望遗憾界O(√(KT log|Π|) + √(D log|Π|))；在函数逼近设置下获得O(√(KTℛ_T(O)) + √(d_max D β))，其中β ≤ log|F|。

Conclusion: 本文为延迟反馈的CMAB问题提供了有效的算法和理论保证，在有限策略类下达到最优，在函数逼近设置下接近下界，仅相差√d_max因子。

Abstract: We present regret minimization algorithms for the contextual multi-armed
bandit (CMAB) problem over $K$ actions in the presence of delayed feedback, a
scenario where loss observations arrive with delays chosen by an adversary. As
a preliminary result, assuming direct access to a finite policy class $\Pi$ we
establish an optimal expected regret bound of $ O (\sqrt{KT \log |\Pi|} +
\sqrt{D \log |\Pi|)} $ where $D$ is the sum of delays. For our main
contribution, we study the general function approximation setting over a
(possibly infinite) contextual loss function class $ \mathcal{F} $ with access
to an online least-square regression oracle $\mathcal{O}$ over $\mathcal{F}$.
In this setting, we achieve an expected regret bound of
$O(\sqrt{KT\mathcal{R}_T(\mathcal{O})} + \sqrt{ d_{\max} D \beta})$ assuming
FIFO order, where $d_{\max}$ is the maximal delay, $\mathcal{R}_T(\mathcal{O})$
is an upper bound on the oracle's regret and $\beta$ is a stability parameter
associated with the oracle. We complement this general result by presenting a
novel stability analysis of a Hedge-based version of Vovk's aggregating
forecaster as an oracle implementation for least-square regression over a
finite function class $\mathcal{F}$ and show that its stability parameter
$\beta$ is bounded by $\log |\mathcal{F}|$, resulting in an expected regret
bound of $O(\sqrt{KT \log |\mathcal{F}|} + \sqrt{d_{\max} D \log
|\mathcal{F}|})$ which is a $\sqrt{d_{\max}}$ factor away from the lower bound
of $\Omega(\sqrt{KT \log |\mathcal{F}|} + \sqrt{D \log |\mathcal{F}|})$ that we
also present.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文研究从成对比较中进行密度估计，通过将未观测的目标密度与经过温度调节的胜者密度相关联，利用分数匹配学习胜者的分数，从而通过"去温度调节"来估计目标密度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动机在于专家知识获取和从人类反馈中学习，特别是在只能获得成对比较数据的情况下进行密度估计。

Method: 方法包括：证明信念密度和胜者密度的分数向量共线，通过位置相关的温度调节场连接；给出该场的解析公式；在Bradley-Terry模型下提出估计器；使用在通过分数缩放退火Langevin动力学生成的温度调节样本上训练的扩散模型。

Result: 能够从仅数百到数千个成对比较中学习模拟专家的复杂多元信念密度。

Conclusion: 通过将目标密度与温度调节的胜者密度相关联，利用分数匹配和扩散模型，可以从有限的成对比较数据中有效估计复杂的多元密度。

Abstract: We study density estimation from pairwise comparisons, motivated by expert
knowledge elicitation and learning from human feedback. We relate the
unobserved target density to a tempered winner density (marginal density of
preferred choices), learning the winner's score via score-matching. This allows
estimating the target by `de-tempering' the estimated winner density's score.
We prove that the score vectors of the belief and the winner density are
collinear, linked by a position-dependent tempering field. We give analytical
formulas for this field and propose an estimator for it under the Bradley-Terry
model. Using a diffusion model trained on tempered samples generated via
score-scaled annealed Langevin dynamics, we can learn complex multivariate
belief densities of simulated experts, from only hundreds to thousands of
pairwise comparisons.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Logits Replay + MoClip两阶段框架，通过压缩logit空间的监督信号和稳定优化更新，在提升领域性能的同时减少通用能力遗忘，降低40%以上训练成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLMs在领域适应中面临的权衡问题：提升专业领域性能往往以牺牲通用能力为代价。现有方法在计算、数据访问或适应性方面成本高昂。

Method: 两阶段框架：Stage 0记录覆盖概率阈值的动态Top-K token子集（包含正确标签）；Stage 1重放这些紧凑子集计算精确重归一化损失。同时设计MoClip优化器，限制梯度动量旋转并应用基于arctan2的更新重缩放。

Result: 在通信技术和NL2SQL任务上提升领域性能，同时在通用基准（MMLU、BBH、GPQA、MATH）上缓解遗忘，训练成本降低超过40%。

Conclusion: 该方法为LLMs领域适应提供了可扩展、架构无关的路径，无需牺牲泛化能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often face a trade-off in post-training:
improvements on specialized domains frequently come at the expense of general
capabilities. Existing solutions attempt to mitigate this tension via
regularization, selective parameter updates, or data-centric replay, but each
imposes significant costs in computation, data access, or adaptability. Recent
work has shown that training signals can be compressed to subsets of logits
without severe accuracy loss, suggesting a path toward efficient adaptation.
However, naive truncation destabilizes optimization and exacerbates forgetting.
  We introduce Logits Replay + MoClip, a two-stage framework that compresses
supervision in the logit space and stabilizes optimization at the update level.
In Stage 0, we record dynamic Top-K token subsets that cover a probability
threshold, always including the gold label. In Stage 1, we replay these compact
subsets to compute exact renormalized losses, avoiding full softmax computation
and implicitly regularizing. To ensure stability, we design MoClip, an
optimizer that caps gradient-momentum rotation and applies an arctan2-based
rescaling of updates. Empirically, our method improves domain performance on
Communication Technology (CT) and NL2SQL tasks while mitigating forgetting on
general benchmarks (MMLU, BBH, GPQA, MATH), and reduces training cost by over
40%. Together, these contributions offer a scalable, architecture-agnostic path
for domain adaptation of LLMs without sacrificing generalization.

TL;DR: Agentic-KGR是一个通过多轮强化学习实现大语言模型与知识图谱协同进化的框架，解决了静态知识库的覆盖不足和时效性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于知识增强的大语言模型依赖静态知识库，存在覆盖不全和时效性差的问题，限制了在动态信息环境中的有效性。

Method: 提出三个关键创新：动态模式扩展机制、检索增强记忆系统、可学习的多尺度提示压缩方法，通过多轮强化学习实现LLM与KG的协同进化。

Result: 实验结果显示在知识抽取任务中显著优于监督基线和单轮RL方法，与GraphRAG集成后在问答任务中取得更优性能，准确率和知识覆盖率均有显著提升。

Conclusion: Agentic-KGR框架通过协同进化机制有效解决了静态知识库的局限性，为动态知识环境下的LLM应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Current knowledge-enhanced large language models (LLMs) rely on static,
pre-constructed knowledge bases that suffer from coverage gaps and temporal
obsolescence, limiting their effectiveness in dynamic information environments.
We present Agentic-KGR, a novel framework enabling co-evolution between LLMs
and knowledge graphs (KGs) through multi-round reinforcement learning (RL). Our
approach introduces three key innovations: (1) a dynamic schema expansion
mechanism that systematically extends graph ontologies beyond pre-defined
boundaries during training; (2) a retrieval-augmented memory system enabling
synergistic co-evolution between model parameters and knowledge structures
through continuous optimization; (3) a learnable multi-scale prompt compression
approach that preserves critical information while reducing computational
complexity through adaptive sequence optimization. Experimental results
demonstrate substantial improvements over supervised baselines and single-round
RL approaches in knowledge extraction tasks. When integrated with GraphRAG, our
method achieves superior performance in downstream QA tasks, with significant
gains in both accuracy and knowledge coverage compared to existing methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该研究提出了首个系统性基准来比较EHR表示方法，发现事件流模型表现最佳，预训练模型在少样本场景下效率高，特征选择策略需根据临床场景调整。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电子健康记录(EHR)支持临床预测的深度学习，但由于评估实践不一致，患者数据的最佳表示方法仍不明确。

Method: 创建标准化基准，在MIMIC-IV和EHRSHOT数据集上比较三种EHR表示范式：多变量时间序列、事件流和文本事件流，评估包括Transformer、MLP、LSTM、Retain、CLMBR、计数模型和LLM等多种模型。

Result: 事件流模型始终表现最佳；预训练模型在少样本设置中样本效率高；特征选择策略需适应临床场景：ICU预测中修剪稀疏特征有益，纵向任务中保留稀疏特征至关重要。

Conclusion: 通过统一可复现的流程，为基于临床背景和数据机制选择EHR表示提供了实用指导。

Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHRs) enable deep learning for clinical
predictions, but the optimal method for representing patient data remains
unclear due to inconsistent evaluation practices. We present the first
systematic benchmark to compare EHR representation methods, including
multivariate time-series, event streams, and textual event streams for LLMs.
This benchmark standardises data curation and evaluation across two distinct
clinical settings: the MIMIC-IV dataset for ICU tasks (mortality, phenotyping)
and the EHRSHOT dataset for longitudinal care (30-day readmission, 1-year
pancreatic cancer). For each paradigm, we evaluate appropriate modelling
families--including Transformers, MLP, LSTMs and Retain for time-series, CLMBR
and count-based models for event streams, 8-20B LLMs for textual streams--and
analyse the impact of feature pruning based on data missingness. Our
experiments reveal that event stream models consistently deliver the strongest
performance. Pre-trained models like CLMBR are highly sample-efficient in
few-shot settings, though simpler count-based models can be competitive given
sufficient data. Furthermore, we find that feature selection strategies must be
adapted to the clinical setting: pruning sparse features improves ICU
predictions, while retaining them is critical for longitudinal tasks. Our
results, enabled by a unified and reproducible pipeline, provide practical
guidance for selecting EHR representations based on the clinical context and
data regime.

TL;DR: 提出WASI方法，通过将训练限制在固定子空间内，显著降低Transformer模型在设备端训练的内存占用和计算成本，同时保持与标准训练相当的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI在日常生活中的普及，能耗和数据隐私成为关键问题。设备端学习可以降低能耗并保护数据隐私，但现代神经网络的规模对设备端训练构成障碍。

Method: 应用基于子空间的训练方法到Transformer模型，引入权重-激活子空间迭代(WASI)，通过将训练限制在模型本质信息所在的固定子空间来缓解反向传播的内存瓶颈。

Result: WASI在保持与标准训练相当准确性的同时，将内存使用减少高达62倍，计算成本(FLOPs)减少高达2倍。在树莓派5上，训练和推理速度比标准训练快约1.5倍。

Conclusion: WASI方法有效解决了Transformer模型在设备端训练的内存和计算瓶颈，为能耗敏感和数据隐私要求高的应用场景提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: As AI increasingly shapes daily life, energy consumption and data privacy
have become pressing concerns. On-device learning trains models directly on
edge devices, cutting energy consumption and safeguarding data privacy.
However, the expanding scale of modern neural networks creates a major obstacle
for on-device training. Although prior work has concentrated on compact
convolutional architectures, we instead apply subspace-based training to
transformer models. Motivated by the idea that a model's essential information
lies in a fixed subspace, we introduce Weight-Activation Subspace Iteration
(WASI), a method that mitigates the memory bottleneck of backpropagation and
boosts inference efficiency in transformer models by restricting training to
this subspace. Our results demonstrate that WASI maintains accuracy comparable
to vanilla training while reducing memory usage by up to $62\times$ and
computational cost (FLOPs) by up to $2\times$. On a Raspberry Pi 5, WASI
achieves roughly $1.5\times$ faster training and inference than vanilla
training.

Method: 提出分层模型合并方案，与标准MergeMany算法进行比较，并测试不同数量模型参与合并时的效果。

Result: 分层合并方案显著优于标准算法，Re-Basin能增强模型的对抗性和扰动鲁棒性，且参与合并的模型越多效果越强，但性能下降比原作者报告的要大。

Conclusion: Git Re-Basin方法在增强模型鲁棒性方面有潜力，但实际性能损失比预期更大，需要进一步优化。

Abstract: This paper takes a closer look at Git Re-Basin, an interesting new approach
to merge trained models. We propose a hierarchical model merging scheme that
significantly outperforms the standard MergeMany algorithm. With our new
algorithm, we find that Re-Basin induces adversarial and perturbation
robustness into the merged models, with the effect becoming stronger the more
models participate in the hierarchical merging scheme. However, in our
experiments Re-Basin induces a much bigger performance drop than reported by
the original authors.

Motivation: 传统功能脑网络建模依赖局部成对交互，难以捕捉高阶依赖关系；现有超图建模方法计算负担重且依赖启发式方法，无法从数据分布进行端到端学习。

Method: 提出全局约束导向的多分辨率(GCM)框架，整合4种全局约束（信号同步、被试身份、期望边数、数据标签）来学习4个不同分辨率层次（样本/被试/组/项目）的功能脑网络结构。

Result: 在5个数据集和2种任务设置下，相比9个基线和10个SOTA方法，GCM实现相对准确率提升30.6%，计算时间减少96.3%。

Conclusion: 该工作为功能脑网络结构学习提供了新视角，为认知神经科学的跨学科应用奠定了基础。

Abstract: Functional brain network (FBN) modeling often relies on local pairwise
interactions, whose limitation in capturing high-order dependencies is
theoretically analyzed in this paper. Meanwhile, the computational burden and
heuristic nature of current hypergraph modeling approaches hinder end-to-end
learning of FBN structures directly from data distributions. To address this,
we propose to extract high-order FBN structures under global constraints, and
implement this as a Global Constraints oriented Multi-resolution (GCM) FBN
structure learning framework. It incorporates 4 types of global constraint
(signal synchronization, subject identity, expected edge numbers, and data
labels) to enable learning FBN structures for 4 distinct levels
(sample/subject/group/project) of modeling resolution. Experimental results
demonstrate that GCM achieves up to a 30.6% improvement in relative accuracy
and a 96.3% reduction in computational time across 5 datasets and 2 task
settings, compared to 9 baselines and 10 state-of-the-art methods. Extensive
experiments validate the contributions of individual components and highlight
the interpretability of GCM. This work offers a novel perspective on FBN
structure learning and provides a foundation for interdisciplinary applications
in cognitive neuroscience. Code is publicly available on

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 持续学习旨在让机器具备类似人类积累新技能的能力，但其核心挑战灾难性遗忘的根本原因尚未在深度网络中得到充分理解。

Method: 通过理论分析发现灾难性遗忘源于训练的低秩偏置，并提出backGP方法来减少由反向传播引起的对抗性对齐。

Result: backGP方法相比梯度投影方法平均减少遗忘10.8%，提高准确率12.7%。

Conclusion: 新任务训练是对旧任务知识的对抗性攻击，通过理解其机制并开发backGP方法，可以有效缓解灾难性遗忘问题。

Abstract: Continual learning seeks the human-like ability to accumulate new skills in
machine intelligence. Its central challenge is catastrophic forgetting, whose
underlying cause has not been fully understood for deep networks. In this
paper, we demystify catastrophic forgetting by revealing that the new-task
training is implicitly an adversarial attack against the old-task knowledge.
Specifically, the new-task gradients automatically and accurately align with
the sharp directions of the old-task loss landscape, rapidly increasing the
old-task loss. This adversarial alignment is intriguingly counter-intuitive
because the sharp directions are too sparsely distributed to align with by
chance. To understand it, we theoretically show that it arises from training's
low-rank bias, which, through forward and backward propagation, confines the
two directions into the same low-dimensional subspace, facilitating alignment.
Gradient projection (GP) methods, a representative family of
forgetting-mitigating methods, reduce adversarial alignment caused by forward
propagation, but cannot address the alignment due to backward propagation. We
propose backGP to address it, which reduces forgetting by 10.8% and improves
accuracy by 12.7% on average over GP methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管多模态大语言模型取得了显著成功，但现有的提示优化方法仍局限于文本模态，限制了MLLMs的潜力发挥。

Method: 提出了多模态提示优化器(MPO)，采用对齐保持更新进行联合优化，并利用贝叶斯选择策略指导候选提示的选择。

Result: 在图像、视频甚至分子等多种模态上的实验表明，MPO优于领先的纯文本优化方法。

Conclusion: 多模态提示优化是实现MLLMs潜力的关键步骤。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable success, and their
multimodal expansions (MLLMs) further unlock capabilities spanning images,
videos, and other modalities beyond text. However, despite this shift, prompt
optimization approaches, designed to reduce the burden of manual prompt
crafting while maximizing performance, remain confined to text, ultimately
limiting the full potential of MLLMs. Motivated by this gap, we introduce the
new problem of multimodal prompt optimization, which expands the prior
definition of prompt optimization to the multimodal space defined by the pairs
of textual and non-textual prompts. To tackle this problem, we then propose the
Multimodal Prompt Optimizer (MPO), a unified framework that not only performs
the joint optimization of multimodal prompts through alignment-preserving
updates but also guides the selection process of candidate prompts by
leveraging earlier evaluations as priors in a Bayesian-based selection
strategy. Through extensive experiments across diverse modalities that go
beyond text, such as images, videos, and even molecules, we demonstrate that
MPO outperforms leading text-only optimization methods, establishing multimodal
prompt optimization as a crucial step to realizing the potential of MLLMs.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合Flow Matching教师模型和MLP学生策略的在线强化学习方法，解决了FM策略在线交互效率低和不稳定的问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Flow Matching在模仿学习中表现出色，但缺乏环境交互和探索能力，在未见场景中泛化能力差，且在线优化困难

Method: 使用MLP学生策略进行在线探索和RL更新，同时利用FM教师模型构建奖励函数并正则化学生策略行为

Result: 实验表明该方法显著提升了学习效率、泛化能力和鲁棒性，特别是在从次优专家数据学习时效果更明显

Conclusion: 通过简单MLP学生策略和复杂FM教师模型的结合，实现了高效在线学习，同时保持了专家数据分布的丰富表达能力

Abstract: Flow Matching (FM) has shown remarkable ability in modeling complex
distributions and achieves strong performance in offline imitation learning for
cloning expert behaviors. However, despite its behavioral cloning
expressiveness, FM-based policies are inherently limited by their lack of
environmental interaction and exploration. This leads to poor generalization in
unseen scenarios beyond the expert demonstrations, underscoring the necessity
of online interaction with environment. Unfortunately, optimizing FM policies
via online interaction is challenging and inefficient due to instability in
gradient computation and high inference costs. To address these issues, we
propose to let a student policy with simple MLP structure explore the
environment and be online updated via RL algorithm with a reward model. This
reward model is associated with a teacher FM model, containing rich information
of expert data distribution. Furthermore, the same teacher FM model is utilized
to regularize the student policy's behavior to stabilize policy learning. Due
to the student's simple architecture, we avoid the gradient instability of FM
policies and enable efficient online exploration, while still leveraging the
expressiveness of the teacher FM model. Extensive experiments show that our
approach significantly enhances learning efficiency, generalization, and
robustness, especially when learning from suboptimal expert data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的化学反应可行性预测模型虽然预测成功，但缺乏透明度和可解释性，需要开发能够解释模型决策的方法。

Method: 引入了质蕴涵解释（最小充分原因）的新表述形式，并提出了在小规模反应预测任务中计算此类解释的算法。

Result: 初步实验表明，质蕴涵解释保守地捕捉了真实解释，虽然常包含冗余的化学键和原子，但始终捕获了对预测反应可行性至关重要的分子属性。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效识别化学反应预测中的关键分子特征，为自动化合成规划提供了更透明的决策依据。

Abstract: Machine learning models that predict the feasibility of chemical reactions
have become central to automated synthesis planning. Despite their predictive
success, these models often lack transparency and interpretability. We
introduce a novel formulation of prime implicant explanations--also known as
minimally sufficient reasons--tailored to this domain, and propose an algorithm
for computing such explanations in small-scale reaction prediction tasks.
Preliminary experiments demonstrate that our notion of prime implicant
explanations conservatively captures the ground truth explanations. That is,
such explanations often contain redundant bonds and atoms but consistently
capture the molecular attributes that are essential for predicting reaction
feasibility.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了在金融机器学习中应对模型漂移的问题，特别是在中亚和高加索地区的发展中经济体，通过使用合成异常值来提高模型对不可预见冲击的稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 金融机器学习模型容易受到模型漂移的影响，特别是在中亚和高加索地区的发展中经济体，这些地区频繁且不可预测的宏观经济冲击会破坏金融数据的稳定性。目前很少有研究探讨这些地区的漂移缓解方法。

Method: 研究使用合成异常值这一较少被探索的方法来提高模型稳定性。引入了一个两级评估框架，用于衡量性能下降程度和冲击严重性。在宏观经济表格数据集上进行了实验。

Result: 实验表明，添加少量合成异常值通常比基线模型更能提高稳定性，但最佳添加量因数据集和模型而异。

Conclusion: 合成异常值是一种有效的模型漂移缓解方法，特别是在面对不可预见冲击时，但需要根据具体数据集和模型调整使用策略。

Abstract: Machine Learning models in finance are highly susceptible to model drift,
where predictive performance declines as data distributions shift. This issue
is especially acute in developing economies such as those in Central Asia and
the Caucasus - including Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, and Azerbaijan -
where frequent and unpredictable macroeconomics shocks destabilize financial
data. To the best of our knowledge, this is among the first studies to examine
drift mitigation methods on financial datasets from these regions. We
investigate the use of synthetic outliers, a largely unexplored approach, to
improve model stability against unforeseen shocks. To evaluate effectiveness,
we introduce a two-level framework that measures both the extent of performance
degradation and the severity of shocks. Our experiments on macroeconomic
tabular datasets show that adding a small proportion of synthetic outliers
generally improves stability compared to baseline models, though the optimal
amount varies by dataset and model

Motivation: 随着大语言模型的广泛部署，来自GitHub、社交媒体等平台的多样化提示数据集不断涌现，这些数据集覆盖了广泛的应用和内容类型，但缺乏系统性的整理和分析。

Method: 收集了来自各种渠道的提示数据集，选择代表性数据集进行系统分析；提出基于词性和依存结构句法嵌入的提示优化方法，通过识别提示的质心表示并引导LLM将提示重写向该质心。

Result: 揭示了不同类别提示在构建方式上的共性与差异，区别于其他文本语料；提出的提示优化方法能够提升模型输出的意义性。

Conclusion: 系统整理了多样化的提示数据集，为提示工程提供了重要资源；提出的基于句法嵌入的优化方法有效改善了提示质量，推动了LLM与人类交互界面的发展。

Abstract: A prompt is a natural language instruction that defines a specific task for a
large language model (LLM) and serves as the primary interface for human-LLM
interaction. With the growing deployment of LLMs, diverse prompt datasets are
emerging from platforms such as GitHub and social media. These datasets span a
wide array of applications and content types, facilitating both broader LLM
utilization and improved prompt engineering. In this work, we--for the first
time--have compiled an extensive list of prompt datasets sourced from various
channels, representing a spectrum of downstream tasks, languages, engineering
techniques, attributes, and modalities. We select key representative datasets
for systematic analysis, revealing commonalities and differences in prompt
construction across categories, distinguishing them from other text corpora
like literature and web. We further propose a prompt optimization approach that
leverages syntactic embeddings of part-of-speech and dependency structures. By
identifying a centroid representation of prompts and guiding LLMs to rewrite
prompts toward this centroid, our method improves the meaningfulness of model
outputs. We have made our datasets and code available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Modelica模型中的代数环会导致仿真效率低下，且存在多解模糊问题，需要一种高效且稳定的替代方案。

Method: 使用前馈神经网络，在损失函数中直接使用代数环的残差进行训练，无需监督数据，并通过残差训练策略确保收敛到一致解。

Result: 在IEEE 14-Bus系统测试中，相比传统仿真方法实现了60%的仿真时间减少，同时通过误差控制机制保持了相同的精度水平。

Conclusion: 残差驱动的机器学习方法能有效替代代数环，显著提升仿真效率，同时保持精度，解决了多解模糊问题。

Abstract: This paper presents a residual-informed machine learning approach for
replacing algebraic loops in equation-based Modelica models with neural network
surrogates. A feedforward neural network is trained using the residual (error)
of the algebraic loop directly in its loss function, eliminating the need for a
supervised dataset. This training strategy also resolves the issue of ambiguous
solutions, allowing the surrogate to converge to a consistent solution rather
than averaging multiple valid ones. Applied to the large-scale IEEE 14-Bus
system, our method achieves a 60% reduction in simulation time compared to
conventional simulations, while maintaining the same level of accuracy through
error control mechanisms.

Motivation: 解决多智能体模仿学习中存在的理论空白，特别是非交互式方法的局限性，以及开发更高效的交互式算法。

Method: 在非交互式设置中证明统计下界并识别全策略偏差集中系数；在交互式设置中提出结合无奖励强化学习与交互式MAIL的框架，并实例化为MAIL-WARM算法。

Conclusion: 本文为多智能体模仿学习建立了完整的理论框架，证明了非交互式方法的根本局限性，并提供了接近最优的交互式解决方案。

Abstract: We close open theoretical gaps in Multi-Agent Imitation Learning (MAIL) by
characterizing the limits of non-interactive MAIL and presenting the first
interactive algorithm with near-optimal sample complexity. In the
non-interactive setting, we prove a statistical lower bound that identifies the
all-policy deviation concentrability coefficient as the fundamental complexity
measure, and we show that Behavior Cloning (BC) is rate-optimal. For the
interactive setting, we introduce a framework that combines reward-free
reinforcement learning with interactive MAIL and instantiate it with an
algorithm, MAIL-WARM. It improves the best previously known sample complexity
from $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-8})$ to $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-2}),$
matching the dependence on $\varepsilon$ implied by our lower bound. Finally,
we provide numerical results that support our theory and illustrate, in
environments such as grid worlds, where Behavior Cloning fails to learn.

TL;DR: 提出了一种模型无关的黑盒安全对齐框架，通过博弈论方法在推理时平衡安全性和有用性，无需重新训练或访问模型内部结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对齐方法需要重新训练或访问模型内部，成本高且不灵活，无法满足第三方利益相关者的需求。

Method: 将安全对齐问题建模为两人零和博弈，使用线性规划求解器在推理时计算均衡策略。

Result: 证明了黑盒安全对齐的可行性，为资源受限的组织提供了可扩展的安全保障途径。

Conclusion: 该框架为快速发展的LLM生态系统提供了可访问且可扩展的安全对齐解决方案。

Abstract: Ensuring that large language models (LLMs) comply with safety requirements is
a central challenge in AI deployment. Existing alignment approaches primarily
operate during training, such as through fine-tuning or reinforcement learning
from human feedback, but these methods are costly and inflexible, requiring
retraining whenever new requirements arise. Recent efforts toward
inference-time alignment mitigate some of these limitations but still assume
access to model internals, which is impractical, and not suitable for third
party stakeholders who do not have access to the models. In this work, we
propose a model-independent, black-box framework for safety alignment that does
not require retraining or access to the underlying LLM architecture. As a proof
of concept, we address the problem of trading off between generating safe but
uninformative answers versus helpful yet potentially risky ones. We formulate
this dilemma as a two-player zero-sum game whose minimax equilibrium captures
the optimal balance between safety and helpfulness. LLM agents operationalize
this framework by leveraging a linear programming solver at inference time to
compute equilibrium strategies. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of
black-box safety alignment, offering a scalable and accessible pathway for
stakeholders, including smaller organizations and entities in
resource-constrained settings, to enforce safety across rapidly evolving LLM
ecosystems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成模型评估具有挑战性，标准指标往往无法反映人类偏好。人类评估更可靠但成本高且噪声大，现有Bradley-Terry方法要么忽略评分者变异性，要么缺乏收敛保证。

Method: 提出BBQ模型，通过贝叶斯方法显式建模评分者质量，使用期望最大化算法保证单调似然收敛，对不可靠参与者进行降权或移除。

Result: 实证结果显示BBQ实现更快收敛、良好校准的不确定性估计，以及相比基线Bradley-Terry模型更稳健、可解释的排名，即使在噪声或众包评分者情况下也表现良好。

Conclusion: 该框架能够实现更可靠和成本效益更高的生成模型人类评估。

Abstract: Evaluating generative models is challenging because standard metrics often
fail to reflect human preferences. Human evaluations are more reliable but
costly and noisy, as participants vary in expertise, attention, and diligence.
Pairwise comparisons improve consistency, yet aggregating them into overall
quality scores requires careful modeling. Bradley-Terry-based methods update
item scores from comparisons, but existing approaches either ignore rater
variability or lack convergence guarantees, limiting robustness and
interpretability. We introduce BBQ, a Bayesian Bradley-Terry variant that
explicitly models rater quality, downweighting or removing unreliable
participants, and provides guaranteed monotonic likelihood convergence through
an Expectation-Maximization algorithm. Empirical results show that BBQ achieves
faster convergence, well-calibrated uncertainty estimates, and more robust,
interpretable rankings compared to baseline Bradley-Terry models, even with
noisy or crowdsourced raters. This framework enables more reliable and
cost-effective human evaluation of generative models.

Motivation: 铁路网络运营效率受列车延误级联效应影响，现有图神经网络方法缺乏网络范围多步自回归预测框架，且缺少实时可解释性以支持决策。

Method: 两阶段自回归图注意力网络(GAT)模型，将系统表示为运营事件(到达和出发)的时空图，包含平台和车站拥堵等细粒度特征，采用顺序k步预测协议模拟真实部署条件。

Result: 虽然GATv2模型在纯误差指标(MAE)上不如简单的持续性基线模型，但在延误事件分类精度上表现更优，这对可靠决策支持工具至关重要。

Conclusion: 该框架为实时列车延误预测提供可行方案，特别在延误事件识别精度方面具有优势，适合作为决策支持工具部署。

Abstract: The operational efficiency of railway networks, a cornerstone of modern
economies, is persistently undermined by the cascading effects of train delays.
Accurately forecasting this delay propagation is a critical challenge for
real-time traffic management. While recent research has leveraged Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs) to model the network structure of railways, a significant gap
remains in developing frameworks that provide multi-step autoregressive
forecasts at a network-wide scale, while simultaneously offering the live,
interpretable explanations needed for decision support. This paper addresses
this gap by developing and evaluating a novel XGeoAI framework for live,
explainable, multi-step train delay forecasting. The core of this work is a
two-stage, autoregressive Graph Attention Network (GAT) model, trained on a
real-world dataset covering over 40% of the Dutch railway network. The model
represents the system as a spatio-temporal graph of operational events
(arrivals and departures) and is enriched with granular features, including
platform and station congestion. To test its viability for live deployment, the
model is rigorously evaluated using a sequential, k-step-ahead forecasting
protocol that simulates real-world conditions where prediction errors can
compound. The results demonstrate that while the proposed GATv2 model is
challenged on pure error metrics (MAE) by a simpler Persistence baseline, it
achieves consistently higher precision in classifying delay events -- a crucial
advantage for a reliable decision support tool.

Motivation: 探究在LLM预训练加速中，计算效率高的近似方法牺牲了多少性能，为大规模训练提供性能上限参考。

Method: 应用完整高斯-牛顿预条件处理到Transformer模型，并与精确的逐层GN预条件器进行比较。

Result: 完整GN更新相比SOAP和Muon等强基线实现了5.4倍的训练迭代减少，逐层GN预条件器几乎能达到完整GN方法的性能。

Conclusion: GN近似对预条件处理非常有效，逐层Hessian结构包含足够信息实现大部分潜在收益，当前近似方法与理想化逐层oracle存在显著性能差距。

Abstract: Recent efforts to accelerate LLM pretraining have focused on
computationally-efficient approximations that exploit second-order structure.
This raises a key question for large-scale training: how much performance is
forfeited by these approximations? To probe this question, we establish a
practical upper bound on iteration complexity by applying full Gauss-Newton
(GN) preconditioning to transformer models of up to 150M parameters. Our
experiments show that full GN updates yield substantial gains over existing
optimizers, achieving a 5.4x reduction in training iterations compared to
strong baselines like SOAP and Muon. Furthermore, we find that a precise
layerwise GN preconditioner, which ignores cross-layer information, nearly
matches the performance of the full GN method. Collectively, our results
suggest: (1) the GN approximation is highly effective for preconditioning,
implying higher-order loss terms may not be critical for convergence speed; (2)
the layerwise Hessian structure contains sufficient information to achieve most
of these potential gains; and (3) a significant performance gap exists between
current approximate methods and an idealized layerwise oracle.

Motivation: 尽管softmax注意力在序列模型中表现优异，但其二次复杂度限制了可扩展性，而线性替代方法如状态空间模型虽然提高了效率，但其信息处理机制的根本差异尚未被充分理解。

Method: 利用动力系统框架表示不同类型的注意力机制，通过分析特征值谱与状态空间模型进行结构化比较，并在多种序列模型和基准测试上进行广泛的实证分析。

Result: 特征值影响记忆和长程依赖建模的关键方面，揭示了与任务需求一致的光谱特征；架构修改对特征值谱和任务性能的影响存在对应关系。

Conclusion: 特征值分析为解释、理解和改进序列模型能力提供了一个有原则的度量标准。

Abstract: Although softmax attention drives state-of-the-art performance for sequence
models, its quadratic complexity limits scalability, motivating linear
alternatives such as state space models (SSMs). While these alternatives
improve efficiency, their fundamental differences in information processing
remain poorly understood. In this work, we leverage the recently proposed
dynamical systems framework to represent softmax, norm and linear attention as
dynamical systems, enabling a structured comparison with SSMs by analyzing
their respective eigenvalue spectra. Since eigenvalues capture essential
aspects of dynamical system behavior, we conduct an extensive empirical
analysis across diverse sequence models and benchmarks. We first show that
eigenvalues influence essential aspects of memory and long-range dependency
modeling, revealing spectral signatures that align with task requirements.
Building on these insights, we then investigate how architectural modifications
in sequence models impact both eigenvalue spectra and task performance. This
correspondence further strengthens the position of eigenvalue analysis as a
principled metric for interpreting, understanding, and ultimately improving the
capabilities of sequence models.

Motivation: 现有课程学习方法在情感识别中通常依赖启发式、数据驱动或模型定义样本难度，忽略了人类感知难度这一主观任务的关键因素。

Method: CHUCKLE框架通过众包数据集中的标注者一致性和对齐度来定义样本难度，假设对人类具有挑战性的样本对机器学习模型同样困难。

Result: 实验结果显示CHUCKLE使LSTM相对平均准确率提升6.56%，Transformer提升1.61%，同时减少了梯度更新次数。

Conclusion: CHUCKLE框架通过感知驱动的课程学习，在提升训练效率和模型鲁棒性的同时，显著改善了情感识别性能。

Abstract: Curriculum learning (CL) structures training from simple to complex samples,
facilitating progressive learning. However, existing CL approaches for emotion
recognition often rely on heuristic, data-driven, or model-based definitions of
sample difficulty, neglecting the difficulty for human perception, a critical
factor in subjective tasks like emotion recognition. We propose CHUCKLE
(Crowdsourced Human Understanding Curriculum for Knowledge Led Emotion
Recognition), a perception-driven CL framework that leverages annotator
agreement and alignment in crowd-sourced datasets to define sample difficulty,
under the assumption that clips challenging for humans are similarly hard for
machine learning models. Empirical results suggest that CHUCKLE increases the
relative mean accuracy by 6.56% for LSTMs and 1.61% for Transformers over
non-curriculum baselines, while reducing the number of gradient updates,
thereby enhancing both training efficiency and model robustness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RL方法如GRPO在任务难度超过模型能力时会失败，导致奖励稀疏和训练低效。先前工作使用离策略数据但往往误导策略更新，核心问题是训练亲和度低。

Method: 引入Affinity指标监控探索效率和训练稳定性，提出HINT自适应提示框架，提供启发式提示而非直接答案，引导模型自主推理。

Result: 在数学推理任务上，HINT持续优于现有方法，在不同规模模型上取得SOTA结果，学习更稳定且数据效率更高。

Conclusion: HINT框架通过改善训练亲和度，有效解决了RL训练中的奖励稀疏问题，提升了模型的长链推理能力。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has become a key driver for enhancing the long
chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs).
However, prevalent methods like GRPO often fail when task difficulty exceeds
the model's capacity, leading to reward sparsity and inefficient training.
While prior work attempts to mitigate this using off-policy data, such as
mixing RL with Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) or using hints, they often misguide
policy updates In this work, we identify a core issue underlying these
failures, which we term low training affinity. This condition arises from a
large distributional mismatch between external guidance and the model's policy.
To diagnose this, we introduce Affinity, the first quantitative metric for
monitoring exploration efficiency and training stability. To improve Affinity,
we propose HINT: Helping Ineffective rollouts Navigate Towards effectiveness,
an adaptive hinting framework. Instead of providing direct answers, HINT
supplies heuristic hints that guide the model to discover solutions on its own,
preserving its autonomous reasoning capabilities. Extensive experiments on
mathematical reasoning tasks show that HINT consistently outperforms existing
methods, achieving state-of-the-art results with models of various scales,
while also demonstrating significantly more stable learning and greater data
efficiency.Code is available on Github.

Conclusion: 该框架不仅解释了近期设计的经验成功，还为系统设计新的序列模型架构提供了指导原则，连接了近期文献中的多个见解和观察。

Abstract: Deep sequence models, ranging from Transformers and State Space Models (SSMs)
to more recent approaches such as gated linear RNNs, fundamentally compute
outputs as linear combinations of past value vectors. To draw insights and
systematically compare such architectures, we develop a unified framework that
makes this output operation explicit, by casting the linear combination
coefficients as the outputs of autonomous linear dynamical systems driven by
impulse inputs. This viewpoint, in spirit substantially different from
approaches focusing on connecting linear RNNs with linear attention, reveals a
common mathematical theme across diverse architectures and crucially captures
softmax attention, on top of RNNs, SSMs, and related models. In contrast to new
model proposals that are commonly evaluated on benchmarks, we derive design
principles linking architectural choices to model properties. Thereby
identifying tradeoffs between expressivity and efficient implementation,
geometric constraints on input selectivity, and stability conditions for
numerically stable training and information retention. By connecting several
insights and observations from recent literature, the framework both explains
empirical successes of recent designs and provides guiding principles for
systematically designing new sequence model architectures.

Abstract: Radio frequency fingerprint identification (RFFI) is a critical technique for
wireless network security, leveraging intrinsic hardware-level imperfections
introduced during device manufacturing to enable precise transmitter
identification. While deep neural networks have shown remarkable capability in
extracting discriminative features, their real-world deployment is hindered by
receiver-induced variability. In practice, RF fingerprint signals comprise
transmitter-specific features as well as channel distortions and
receiver-induced biases. Although channel equalization can mitigate channel
noise, receiver-induced feature shifts remain largely unaddressed, causing the
RFFI models to overfit to receiver-specific patterns. This limitation is
particularly problematic when training and evaluation share the same receiver,
as replacing the receiver in deployment can cause substantial performance
degradation. To tackle this challenge, we propose an RFFI framework robust to
cross-receiver variability, integrating adversarial training and style transfer
to explicitly disentangle transmitter and receiver features. By enforcing
domain-invariant representation learning, our method isolates genuine hardware
signatures from receiver artifacts, ensuring robustness against receiver
changes. Extensive experiments on multi-receiver datasets demonstrate that our
approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving up to a
10% improvement in average accuracy across diverse receiver settings.

Abstract: Learning on temporal graphs has become a central topic in graph
representation learning, with numerous benchmarks indicating the strong
performance of state-of-the-art models. However, recent work has raised
concerns about the reliability of benchmark results, noting issues with
commonly used evaluation protocols and the surprising competitiveness of simple
heuristics. This contrast raises the question of which properties of the
underlying graphs temporal graph learning models actually use to form their
predictions. We address this by systematically evaluating seven models on their
ability to capture eight fundamental attributes related to the link structure
of temporal graphs. These include structural characteristics such as density,
temporal patterns such as recency, and edge formation mechanisms such as
homophily. Using both synthetic and real-world datasets, we analyze how well
models learn these attributes. Our findings reveal a mixed picture: models
capture some attributes well but fail to reproduce others. With this, we expose
important limitations. Overall, we believe that our results provide practical
insights for the application of temporal graph learning models, and motivate
more interpretability-driven evaluations in temporal graph learning research.

TL;DR: 论文研究了权重初始化对训练的影响，通过实验验证了ReLU多层感知机和GPT-2风格Transformer在不同初始化标准差下的表现，发现1e-2到1e-1的标准差范围最稳定，Kaiming初始化优于Xavier，并观察到Transformer层间权重方差随深度变化的规律。


<details>

Motivation: 权重初始化控制着训练初期的信号传播和梯度流动，对训练稳定性和收敛速度至关重要。本研究旨在通过理论分析和实证验证，探索不同初始化策略在不同网络架构中的表现。

Method: 采用对数扫描初始化标准差的方法，比较了Kaiming和Xavier初始化在ReLU网络中的表现，并在12层GPT-2风格模型上跟踪了预训练过程中各层Q/K/V权重的方差变化。

Result: 发现1e-2到1e-1的标准差范围形成稳定的训练区域；Kaiming初始化在ReLU网络中收敛更快更稳定；Transformer浅层权重方差快速扩展，深层变化更渐进，最终收敛到窄带区域。

Conclusion: 研究将经典初始化原则与现代Transformer行为联系起来，提供了简单实用的鲁棒训练方案，证明了初始化策略对深度学习模型训练的重要性。

Abstract: Weight initialization governs signal propagation and gradient flow at the
start of training. This paper offers a theory-grounded and empirically
validated study across two regimes: compact ReLU multilayer perceptrons and
GPT-2-style transformers. First, a logarithmic sweep of the initial standard
deviation maps vanishing and exploding regimes and identifies a broad stability
band with standard deviations between 1e-2 and 1e-1. Second, a controlled
comparison shows that Kaiming (fan-in) initialization converges faster and more
stably than Xavier under ReLU, consistent with variance-preserving theory.
Third, in a from-scratch 12-layer GPT-2-style model, this paper tracks
layerwise Q/K/V weight variance through pretraining and observe depth-dependent
equilibration into narrow bands: shallow layers expand rapidly while deeper
layers change more gradually. Together, these results connect classic
initialization principles with modern transformer behavior and yield simple,
practical recipes for robust training.

Motivation: 在线随机匹配问题在无结构假设下计算最优匹配是NP难的，使得在线学习计算不可行。为了克服这一障碍，作者利用社会选择理论中成熟的单峰偏好结构来简化问题。

Method: 针对单峰偏好结构，设计了离线预算匹配的高效算法，并将其转化为在线算法。提出了基于PQ树的顺序近似方法，并在已知单峰结构时开发了UCB-like算法。

Result: 提出的在线算法获得了O~(UKT^{2/3})的遗憾界，而已知单峰结构时的UCB-like算法获得了O~(U√(TK))的遗憾界。

Conclusion: 通过利用单峰偏好结构，成功克服了在线随机匹配问题的计算复杂性障碍，设计了高效的在线学习算法并获得次线性遗憾界。

Abstract: We study an online stochastic matching problem in which an algorithm
sequentially matches $U$ users to $K$ arms, aiming to maximize cumulative
reward over $T$ rounds under budget constraints. Without structural
assumptions, computing the optimal matching is NP-hard, making online learning
computationally infeasible. To overcome this barrier, we focus on
\emph{single-peaked preferences} -- a well-established structure in social
choice theory, where users' preferences are unimodal with respect to a common
order over arms. We devise an efficient algorithm for the offline budgeted
matching problem, and leverage it into an efficient online algorithm with a
regret of $\tilde O(UKT^{2/3})$. Our approach relies on a novel PQ tree-based
order approximation method. If the single-peaked structure is known, we develop
an efficient UCB-like algorithm that achieves a regret bound of $\tilde
O(U\sqrt{TK})$.

*Disharee Bhowmick,Ranjith Ramanathan,Sathyanarayanan N. Aakur*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: STaTS是一个轻量级的无监督框架，用于结构感知的时间序列摘要，通过自适应压缩时间序列为紧凑的标记序列，实现高达30倍的序列压缩同时保留核心时间动态。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有时间序列模型通常处理原始或固定窗口序列，将所有时间步视为同等信息，导致在长序列或噪声序列中效率低下、鲁棒性差和可扩展性有限。

Method: STaTS使用基于BIC的统计差异准则检测多个时间分辨率的变化点，然后使用均值或GMM等生成模型总结每个片段。

Result: 在150多个数据集上的实验表明，STaTS能够实现85-90%的完整模型性能，同时显著降低计算成本，并在噪声下提高鲁棒性。

Conclusion: STaTS作为一个原则性的通用解决方案，为高效、结构感知的时间序列建模提供了有效方法。

Abstract: Time series data often contain latent temporal structure, transitions between
locally stationary regimes, repeated motifs, and bursts of variability, that
are rarely leveraged in standard representation learning pipelines. Existing
models typically operate on raw or fixed-window sequences, treating all time
steps as equally informative, which leads to inefficiencies, poor robustness,
and limited scalability in long or noisy sequences. We propose STaTS, a
lightweight, unsupervised framework for Structure-Aware Temporal Summarization
that adaptively compresses both univariate and multivariate time series into
compact, information-preserving token sequences. STaTS detects change points
across multiple temporal resolutions using a BIC-based statistical divergence
criterion, then summarizes each segment using simple functions like the mean or
generative models such as GMMs. This process achieves up to 30x sequence
compression while retaining core temporal dynamics. STaTS operates as a
model-agnostic preprocessor and can be integrated with existing unsupervised
time series encoders without retraining. Extensive experiments on 150+
datasets, including classification tasks on the UCR-85, UCR-128, and UEA-30
archives, and forecasting on ETTh1 and ETTh2, ETTm1, and Electricity,
demonstrate that STaTS enables 85-90\% of the full-model performance while
offering dramatic reductions in computational cost. Moreover, STaTS improves
robustness under noise and preserves discriminative structure, outperforming
uniform and clustering-based compression baselines. These results position
STaTS as a principled, general-purpose solution for efficient, structure-aware
time series modeling.

TL;DR: 本文证明了均匀缩放流（USFs）在理论上连接了深度单类分类和密度估计两种异常检测范式，通过最大似然训练USFs可简化为Deep SVDD目标，并提出了将USFs作为非USFs的直接替代方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前无监督异常检测存在深度单类分类和密度估计两种主流范式，但两者之间的理论联系尚不明确。本文旨在建立这两种方法之间的理论桥梁。

Method: 提出均匀缩放流（USFs）作为连接两种范式的理论工具，证明USFs的最大似然训练等价于Deep SVDD目标，并展示了如何将USFs集成到现代异常检测架构中。

Result: 实验表明，在多个基准测试和模型骨干网络中，用USFs替代非USFs能带来一致的性能提升和显著改善的训练稳定性，适用于图像级和像素级检测。

Conclusion: USFs统一了两种主要的异常检测范式，既推进了理论理解又提升了实际性能，建议将USFs作为非USFs的直接替代方案。

Abstract: Unsupervised anomaly detection is often framed around two widely studied
paradigms. Deep one-class classification, exemplified by Deep SVDD, learns
compact latent representations of normality, while density estimators realized
by normalizing flows directly model the likelihood of nominal data. In this
work, we show that uniformly scaling flows (USFs), normalizing flows with a
constant Jacobian determinant, precisely connect these approaches.
Specifically, we prove how training a USF via maximum-likelihood reduces to a
Deep SVDD objective with a unique regularization that inherently prevents
representational collapse. This theoretical bridge implies that USFs inherit
both the density faithfulness of flows and the distance-based reasoning of
one-class methods. We further demonstrate that USFs induce a tighter alignment
between negative log-likelihood and latent norm than either Deep SVDD or
non-USFs, and how recent hybrid approaches combining one-class objectives with
VAEs can be naturally extended to USFs. Consequently, we advocate using USFs as
a drop-in replacement for non-USFs in modern anomaly detection architectures.
Empirically, this substitution yields consistent performance gains and
substantially improved training stability across multiple benchmarks and model
backbones for both image-level and pixel-level detection. These results unify
two major anomaly detection paradigms, advancing both theoretical understanding
and practical performance.

TL;DR: 本文研究发现基于LLM监控器的AI控制协议存在严重安全漏洞，攻击者可以通过自适应攻击嵌入公开已知或零样本提示注入来绕过监控，导致控制协议失效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的AI控制协议主要依赖LLM监控器作为防御机制，但这些监控器可能成为单点故障。研究者想要探索当不信任模型了解协议和监控模型时的自适应攻击效果。

Method: 研究者实例化了一种简单的自适应攻击向量，攻击者在模型输出中嵌入公开已知或零样本提示注入，测试前沿模型是否能绕过多样化监控器完成恶意任务。

Result: 攻击在两种主要AI控制基准测试中持续成功，前沿模型能够绕过多样化监控器完成恶意任务。特别是Defer-to-Resample协议反而会放大提示注入，将其转化为最佳n次攻击。

Conclusion: 对监控模型的自适应攻击是当前控制协议的主要盲点，应该成为未来AI控制机制评估的标准组成部分。

Abstract: AI control protocols serve as a defense mechanism to stop untrusted LLM
agents from causing harm in autonomous settings. Prior work treats this as a
security problem, stress testing with exploits that use the deployment context
to subtly complete harmful side tasks, such as backdoor insertion. In practice,
most AI control protocols are fundamentally based on LLM monitors, which can
become a central point of failure. We study adaptive attacks by an untrusted
model that knows the protocol and the monitor model, which is plausible if the
untrusted model was trained with a later knowledge cutoff or can search for
this information autonomously. We instantiate a simple adaptive attack vector
by which the attacker embeds publicly known or zero-shot prompt injections in
the model outputs. Using this tactic, frontier models consistently evade
diverse monitors and complete malicious tasks on two main AI control
benchmarks. The attack works universally against current protocols that rely on
a monitor. Furthermore, the recent Defer-to-Resample protocol even backfires,
as its resampling amplifies the prompt injection and effectively reframes it as
a best-of-$n$ attack. In general, adaptive attacks on monitor models represent
a major blind spot in current control protocols and should become a standard
component of evaluations for future AI control mechanisms.

Abstract: Latent manifolds of autoencoders provide low-dimensional representations of
data, which can be studied from a geometric perspective. We propose to describe
these latent manifolds as implicit submanifolds of some ambient latent space.
Based on this, we develop tools for a discrete Riemannian calculus
approximating classical geometric operators. These tools are robust against
inaccuracies of the implicit representation often occurring in practical
examples. To obtain a suitable implicit representation, we propose to learn an
approximate projection onto the latent manifold by minimizing a denoising
objective. This approach is independent of the underlying autoencoder and
supports the use of different Riemannian geometries on the latent manifolds.
The framework in particular enables the computation of geodesic paths
connecting given end points and shooting geodesics via the Riemannian
exponential maps on latent manifolds. We evaluate our approach on various
autoencoders trained on synthetic and real data.

Conclusion: CRPS-LAM是概率性区域天气预报的有效方法，在保持准确性的同时大幅提升计算效率。

Abstract: Machine learning for weather prediction increasingly relies on ensemble
methods to provide probabilistic forecasts. Diffusion-based models have shown
strong performance in Limited-Area Modeling (LAM) but remain computationally
expensive at sampling time. Building on the success of global weather
forecasting models trained based on Continuous Ranked Probability Score (CRPS),
we introduce CRPS-LAM, a probabilistic LAM forecasting model trained with a
CRPS-based objective. By sampling and injecting a single latent noise vector
into the model, CRPS-LAM generates ensemble members in a single forward pass,
achieving sampling speeds up to 39 times faster than a diffusion-based model.
We evaluate the model on the MEPS regional dataset, where CRPS-LAM matches the
low errors of diffusion models. By retaining also fine-scale forecast details,
the method stands out as an effective approach for probabilistic regional
weather forecasting

Conclusion: 研究推进了对基于softmax的注意力机制的理解，表明需要开发更鲁棒的归一化和选择策略来改进未来注意力架构。

Abstract: This paper investigates the limitations of the normalization in attention
mechanisms. We begin with a theoretical framework that enables the
identification of the model's selective ability and the geometric separation
involved in token selection. Our analysis includes explicit bounds on distances
and separation criteria for token vectors under softmax scaling. Through
experiments with pre-trained GPT-2 model, we empirically validate our
theoretical results and analyze key behaviors of the attention mechanism.
Notably, we demonstrate that as the number of selected tokens increases, the
model's ability to distinguish informative tokens declines, often converging
toward a uniform selection pattern. We also show that gradient sensitivity
under softmax normalization presents challenges during training, especially at
low temperature settings. These findings advance current understanding of
softmax-based attention mechanism and motivate the need for more robust
normalization and selection strategies in future attention architectures.

Abstract: We study the problem of sampling from a distribution under local differential
privacy (LDP). Given a private distribution $P \in \mathcal{P}$, the goal is to
generate a single sample from a distribution that remains close to $P$ in
$f$-divergence while satisfying the constraints of LDP. This task captures the
fundamental challenge of producing realistic-looking data under strong privacy
guarantees. While prior work by Park et al. (NeurIPS'24) focuses on global
minimax-optimality across a class of distributions, we take a local
perspective. Specifically, we examine the minimax risk in a neighborhood around
a fixed distribution $P_0$, and characterize its exact value, which depends on
both $P_0$ and the privacy level. Our main result shows that the local minimax
risk is determined by the global minimax risk when the distribution class
$\mathcal{P}$ is restricted to a neighborhood around $P_0$. To establish this,
we (1) extend previous work from pure LDP to the more general functional LDP
framework, and (2) prove that the globally optimal functional LDP sampler
yields the optimal local sampler when constrained to distributions near $P_0$.
Building on this, we also derive a simple closed-form expression for the
locally minimax-optimal samplers which does not depend on the choice of
$f$-divergence. We further argue that this local framework naturally models
private sampling with public data, where the public data distribution is
represented by $P_0$. In this setting, we empirically compare our locally
optimal sampler to existing global methods, and demonstrate that it
consistently outperforms global minimax samplers.

Abstract: We study online adversarial imitation learning (AIL), where an agent learns
from offline expert demonstrations and interacts with the environment online
without access to rewards. Despite strong empirical results, the benefits of
online interaction and the impact of stochasticity remain poorly understood. We
address these gaps by introducing a model-based AIL algorithm (MB-AIL) and
establish its horizon-free, second-order sample-complexity guarantees under
general function approximations for both expert data and reward-free
interactions. These second-order bounds provide an instance-dependent result
that can scale with the variance of returns under the relevant policies and
therefore tighten as the system approaches determinism. Together with
second-order, information-theoretic lower bounds on a newly constructed
hard-instance family, we show that MB-AIL attains minimax-optimal sample
complexity for online interaction (up to logarithmic factors) with limited
expert demonstrations and matches the lower bound for expert demonstrations in
terms of the dependence on horizon $H$, precision $\epsilon$ and the policy
variance $\sigma^2$. Experiments further validate our theoretical findings and
demonstrate that a practical implementation of MB-AIL matches or surpasses the
sample efficiency of existing methods.

Abstract: Kidneys are the filter of the human body. About 10% of the global population
is thought to be affected by Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD), which causes kidney
function to decline. To protect in danger patients from additional kidney
damage, effective risk evaluation of CKD and appropriate CKD monitoring are
crucial. Due to quick and precise detection capabilities, Machine Learning
models can help practitioners accomplish this goal efficiently; therefore, an
enormous number of diagnosis systems and processes in the healthcare sector
nowadays are relying on machine learning due to its disease prediction
capability. In this study, we designed and suggested disease predictive
computer-aided designs for the diagnosis of CKD. The dataset for CKD is
attained from the repository of machine learning of UCL, with a few missing
values; those are filled in using "mean-mode" and "Random sampling method"
strategies. After successfully achieving the missing data, eight ML techniques
(Random Forest, SVM, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, KNN, XGBoost, Decision
Tree, and AdaBoost) were used to establish models, and the performance
evaluation comparisons among the result accuracies are measured by the
techniques to find the machine learning models with the highest accuracy. Among
them, Random Forest as well as Logistic Regression showed an outstanding 99%
accuracy, followed by the Ada Boost, XGBoost, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, and

TL;DR: Geo-STARS是一个地理感知的时空建模框架，通过引入地理感知嵌入来捕捉跨区域和尺度的共享模式，解决了环境生态系统建模中的泛化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有物理和数据驱动模型难以泛化到不同空间区域和尺度，主要由于环境生态系统中固有的数据异质性和有限的观测样本。

Method: 提出地理感知嵌入，利用地理信息显式捕捉跨空间区域和尺度的共享原则和模式，并将其集成到门控时空图神经网络中。

Result: 在预测美国东海岸多个流域37年溪流水温的真实数据集上，Geo-STARS在跨区域和跨尺度泛化性能上优于最先进的基线方法。

Conclusion: Geo-STARS展示了在可扩展、数据高效的环境监测和决策制定方面的潜力。

Abstract: Understanding environmental ecosystems is vital for the sustainable
management of our planet. However,existing physics-based and data-driven models
often fail to generalize to varying spatial regions and scales due to the
inherent data heterogeneity presented in real environmental ecosystems. This
generalization issue is further exacerbated by the limited observation samples
available for model training. To address these issues, we propose Geo-STARS, a
geo-aware spatio-temporal modeling framework for predicting stream water
temperature across different watersheds and spatial scales. The major
innovation of Geo-STARS is the introduction of geo-aware embedding, which
leverages geographic information to explicitly capture shared principles and
patterns across spatial regions and scales. We further integrate the geo-aware
embedding into a gated spatio-temporal graph neural network. This design
enables the model to learn complex spatial and temporal patterns guided by
geographic and hydrological context, even with sparse or no observational data.
We evaluate Geo-STARS's efficacy in predicting stream water temperature, which
is a master factor for water quality. Using real-world datasets spanning 37
years across multiple watersheds along the eastern coast of the United States,
Geo-STARS demonstrates its superior generalization performance across both
regions and scales, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines. These results
highlight the promise of Geo-STARS for scalable, data-efficient environmental
monitoring and decision-making.

Motivation: 解决神经网络模型优化中的分布式计算、压缩技术和高效训练等关键挑战，满足对可扩展和资源高效模型日益增长的需求。

Method: 开发PETRA自动化机器学习框架，应用进化优化算法来优化模型架构和训练策略，包含剪枝、量化和损失正则化技术。

Result: 在真实世界金融事件序列、图像和时间序列基准测试中，PETRA显著减小模型规模(达75%)和延迟(达33%)，提升吞吐量(13%)，且目标指标无明显下降。

Conclusion: PETRA框架有效解决了神经网络模型优化的关键挑战，实现了模型压缩和性能提升的平衡，为可扩展和资源高效的模型部署提供了可行方案。

Abstract: There are many critical challenges in optimizing neural network models,
including distributed computing, compression techniques, and efficient
training, regardless of their application to specific tasks. Solving such
problems is crucial because the need for scalable and resource-efficient models
is increasing. To address these challenges, we have developed a new automated
machine learning (AutoML) framework, Parameter Efficient Training with Robust
Automation (PETRA). It applies evolutionary optimization to model architecture
and training strategy. PETRA includes pruning, quantization, and loss
regularization. Experimental studies on real-world data with financial event
sequences, as well as image and time-series -- benchmarks, demonstrate PETRA's
ability to improve neural model performance and scalability -- namely, a
significant decrease in model size (up to 75%) and latency (up to 33%), and an
increase in throughput (by 13%) without noticeable degradation in the target
metric.

### [358] [MODE: Learning compositional representations of complex systems with Mixtures Of Dynamical Experts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09594)
*Nathan Quiblier,Roy Friedman,Matthew Ricci*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MODE是一个图模型框架，使用神经门控机制将复杂动态分解为稀疏可解释组件，能够无监督发现行为机制并在机制转换中进行准确长期预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生命科学中的动态系统通常包含复杂重叠的行为机制，传统基于流的建模技术假设局部平滑动态，难以处理机制间噪声和不规则转换。

Method: 提出MODE（Mixture Of Dynamical Experts）框架，通过神经门控机制分解复杂动态为稀疏可解释组件，允许智能体跳转到不同控制法则。

Result: 在合成和真实计算生物学数据集上验证，包括无监督分类任务、具有挑战性的预测任务，以及在单细胞RNA测序数据中区分增殖与分化动态并预测细胞命运承诺时间。

Conclusion: MODE特别适合处理噪声转换，能够解决计算生物学中的关键挑战，包括细胞命运承诺预测等难题。

Abstract: Dynamical systems in the life sciences are often composed of complex mixtures
of overlapping behavioral regimes. Cellular subpopulations may shift from
cycling to equilibrium dynamics or branch towards different developmental
fates. The transitions between these regimes can appear noisy and irregular,
posing a serious challenge to traditional, flow-based modeling techniques which
assume locally smooth dynamics. To address this challenge, we propose MODE
(Mixture Of Dynamical Experts), a graphical modeling framework whose neural
gating mechanism decomposes complex dynamics into sparse, interpretable
components, enabling both the unsupervised discovery of behavioral regimes and
accurate long-term forecasting across regime transitions. Crucially, because
agents in our framework can jump to different governing laws, MODE is
especially tailored to the aforementioned noisy transitions. We evaluate our
method on a battery of synthetic and real datasets from computational biology.
First, we systematically benchmark MODE on an unsupervised classification task
using synthetic dynamical snapshot data, including in noisy, few-sample
settings. Next, we show how MODE succeeds on challenging forecasting tasks
which simulate key cycling and branching processes in cell biology. Finally, we
deploy our method on human, single-cell RNA sequencing data and show that it
can not only distinguish proliferation from differentiation dynamics but also
predict when cells will commit to their ultimate fate, a key outstanding
challenge in computational biology.

*Sangyun Lee,Brandon Amos,Giulia Fanti*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BaNEL算法通过仅使用失败样本进行后训练，在稀疏奖励任务中显著提升模型性能，同时最小化奖励评估次数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前生成模型依赖大量监督数据和密集奖励信号，但在困难问题中面临两个挑战：基础模型获得接近零的奖励信号，以及奖励评估成本高昂。

Method: 将学习失败规律建模为另一个生成建模问题，利用该模型判断新数据是否与已知失败相似，并引导生成远离这些失败模式。

Result: 在多个稀疏奖励任务中，BaNEL无需观察任何成功样本即可提升性能，在成功率上比现有新颖性奖励方法高出数个数量级，同时使用更少的奖励评估。

Conclusion: BaNEL为解决稀疏奖励环境中的后训练问题提供了一种有效方法，通过专注于失败模式学习来提升生成质量。

Abstract: Today's generative models thrive with large amounts of supervised data and
informative reward functions characterizing the quality of the generation. They
work under the assumptions that the supervised data provides knowledge to
pre-train the model, and the reward function provides dense information about
how to further improve the generation quality and correctness. However, in the
hardest instances of important problems, two problems arise: (1) the base
generative model attains a near-zero reward signal, and (2) calls to the reward
oracle are expensive. This setting poses a fundamentally different learning
challenge than standard reward-based post-training. To address this, we propose
BaNEL (Bayesian Negative Evidence Learning), an algorithm that post-trains the
model using failed attempts only, while minimizing the number of reward
evaluations (NREs). Our method is based on the idea that the problem of
learning regularities underlying failures can be cast as another, in-loop
generative modeling problem. We then leverage this model to assess whether new
data resembles previously seen failures and steer the generation away from
them. We show that BaNEL can improve model performance without observing a
single successful sample on several sparse-reward tasks, outperforming existing
novelty-bonus approaches by up to several orders of magnitude in success rate,
while using fewer reward evaluations.

TL;DR: 本研究评估开源大语言模型作为本地部署意图解析系统的可行性，与GPT-4进行性能对比，探讨其在下一代操作系统中的潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于云端专有模型的实现存在隐私、自主性和可扩展性限制，本地部署是实现真正健壮可信语言交互界面的必要条件。

Method: 对多个开源和开放访问模型进行比较分析，评估它们在生成用户意图工作流程方面的能力，并与OpenAI的GPT-4系统进行性能对比。

Result: 研究提供了关于开源LLMs作为本地可操作组件的实际可行性、性能权衡和潜力的实证见解。

Conclusion: 研究结果支持AI基础设施的去中心化和民主化，指向通过本地嵌入式智能实现更无缝、自适应和隐私保护的用户设备交互未来。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as transformative tools for natural
language understanding and user intent resolution, enabling tasks such as
translation, summarization, and, increasingly, the orchestration of complex
workflows. This development signifies a paradigm shift from conventional,
GUI-driven user interfaces toward intuitive, language-first interaction
paradigms. Rather than manually navigating applications, users can articulate
their objectives in natural language, enabling LLMs to orchestrate actions
across multiple applications in a dynamic and contextual manner. However,
extant implementations frequently rely on cloud-based proprietary models, which
introduce limitations in terms of privacy, autonomy, and scalability. For
language-first interaction to become a truly robust and trusted interface
paradigm, local deployment is not merely a convenience; it is an imperative.
This limitation underscores the importance of evaluating the feasibility of
locally deployable, open-source, and open-access LLMs as foundational
components for future intent-based operating systems. In this study, we examine
the capabilities of several open-source and open-access models in facilitating
user intention resolution through machine assistance. A comparative analysis is
conducted against OpenAI's proprietary GPT-4-based systems to assess
performance in generating workflows for various user intentions. The present
study offers empirical insights into the practical viability, performance
trade-offs, and potential of open LLMs as autonomous, locally operable
components in next-generation operating systems. The results of this study
inform the broader discussion on the decentralization and democratization of AI
infrastructure and point toward a future where user-device interaction becomes
more seamless, adaptive, and privacy-conscious through locally embedded
intelligence.

### [361] [Which Is Better For Reducing Outdated and Vulnerable Dependencies: Pinning or Floating?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08609)
*Imranur Rahman,Jill Marley,William Enck,Laurie Williams*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 该研究通过实证分析npm、PyPI和Cargo生态系统中依赖版本约束的使用情况，评估了不同版本约束类型导致依赖过时或存在漏洞的可能性。研究发现浮动次要版本约束最可能导致过时依赖，而浮动主要版本约束最不容易导致过时依赖。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发者在依赖管理时面临固定版本（pinning）和浮动版本（floating）的权衡：固定版本可减少破坏性变更风险但容易导致依赖过时，浮动版本能自动获取修复但可能引入破坏性变更。目前缺乏关于不同版本约束类型如何影响依赖过时或漏洞风险的实证研究。

Method: 研究首先分析了npm、PyPI和Cargo生态系统中依赖版本约束的使用趋势和变更模式，然后使用生存分析建模依赖状态转换，评估固定版本与其他版本约束类型相比导致依赖过时或存在漏洞的可能性。

Result: 在过时和存在漏洞的依赖中，浮动次要版本约束是最常用的约束类型，固定版本次之。浮动主要版本约束最不容易导致依赖过时，而浮动次要版本约束最不容易导致依赖存在漏洞。

Conclusion: 研究为开发者提供了选择依赖版本约束的实证依据，建议根据具体需求平衡版本约束类型的选择，而不是一味采用固定版本策略。

Abstract: Developers consistently use version constraints to specify acceptable
versions of the dependencies for their project. \emph{Pinning} dependencies can
reduce the likelihood of breaking changes, but comes with a cost of manually
managing the replacement of outdated and vulnerable dependencies. On the other
hand, \emph{floating} can be used to automatically get bug fixes and security
fixes, but comes with the risk of breaking changes. Security practitioners
advocate \emph{pinning} dependencies to prevent against software supply chain
attacks, e.g., malicious package updates. However, since \emph{pinning} is the
tightest version constraint, \emph{pinning} is the most likely to result in
outdated dependencies. Nevertheless, how the likelihood of becoming outdated or
vulnerable dependencies changes across version constraint types is unknown. The
goal of this study is to aid developers in making an informed dependency
version constraint choice by empirically evaluating the likelihood of
dependencies becoming outdated or vulnerable across version constraint types at
scale. In this study, we first identify the trends in dependency version
constraint usage and the patterns of version constraint type changes made by
developers in the npm, PyPI, and Cargo ecosystems. We then modeled the
dependency state transitions using survival analysis and estimated how the
likelihood of becoming outdated or vulnerable changes when using \emph{pinning}
as opposed to the rest of the version constraint types. We observe that among
outdated and vulnerable dependencies, the most commonly used version constraint
type is \emph{floating-minor}, with \emph{pinning} being the next most common.
We also find that \emph{floating-major} is the least likely to result in
outdated and \emph{floating-minor} is the least likely to result in vulnerable
dependencies.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于代码分块和相对定位的上下文收集策略，用于提升大语言模型在代码补全任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有IDE中的代码补全功能缺乏对如何为LLMs构建有效上下文的研究，需要确定什么信息能让LLMs在代码补全中表现更好。

Method: 将代码库预处理为更小的代码块，然后使用基于语法和语义相似性的代码块检索方法，并结合相对位置信息。

Result: 代码分块和代码块在最终上下文中的相对定位能够提升代码补全任务的性能。

Conclusion: 提出的上下文收集策略能够有效帮助LLMs在代码补全任务中表现更好。

Abstract: Code completion can help developers improve efficiency and ease the
development lifecycle. Although code completion is available in modern
integrated development environments (IDEs), research lacks in determining what
makes a good context for code completion based on the information available to
the IDEs for the large language models (LLMs) to perform better. In this paper,
we describe an effective context collection strategy to assist the LLMs in
performing better at code completion tasks. The key idea of our strategy is to
preprocess the repository into smaller code chunks and later use syntactic and
semantic similarity-based code chunk retrieval with relative positioning. We
found that code chunking and relative positioning of the chunks in the final
context improve the performance of code completion tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs越来越多地集成到软件开发过程中，需要了解它们如何影响团队工作流程和生产力，特别是在SDLC中的协作方面。

Method: 通过文献综述、行业案例、团队调查和两个案例研究，评估LLM辅助工具（如代码生成助手和AI驱动的项目管理代理）对协作软件工程实践的影响。

Result: 研究发现LLMs能显著提高效率（通过自动化重复性任务和文档）、增强沟通清晰度、促进跨职能协作，但也引入了模型局限性和隐私问题等新挑战。

Conclusion: LLMs在软件团队协作中具有重要价值，未来研究方向包括领域特定模型定制、改进开发工具集成以及确保信任和安全的稳健策略。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being integrated into software
development processes, with the potential to transform team workflows and
productivity. This paper investigates how LLMs affect team collaboration
throughout the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). We reframe and update a
prior study with recent developments as of 2025, incorporating new literature
and case studies. We outline the problem of collaboration hurdles in SDLC and
explore how LLMs can enhance productivity, communication, and decision-making
in a team context. Through literature review, industry examples, a team survey,
and two case studies, we assess the impact of LLM-assisted tools (such as code
generation assistants and AI-powered project management agents) on
collaborative software engineering practices. Our findings indicate that LLMs
can significantly improve efficiency (by automating repetitive tasks and
documentation), enhance communication clarity, and aid cross-functional
collaboration, while also introducing new challenges like model limitations and
privacy concerns. We discuss these benefits and challenges, present research
questions guiding the investigation, evaluate threats to validity, and suggest
future research directions including domain-specific model customization,
improved integration into development tools, and robust strategies for ensuring
trust and security.

*Ha Min Son,Huan Ren,Xin Liu,Zhe Zhao*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 提出了GradleFixer，一个专门用于修复Android构建错误的LLM代理，通过领域特定工具显著提升了构建错误修复成功率（81.4%），优于依赖通用shell的编码代理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Android作为最大的移动平台，自动构建应用仍面临挑战。LLM在代码修复方面显示潜力，但在修复Android构建错误方面研究不足。

Method: 首先创建AndroidBuildBench基准测试集（1,019个构建失败案例），然后提出GradleFixer LLM代理，配备用于检查和操作Gradle构建环境的领域特定工具。

Result: GradleFixer实现了81.4%的解决率（pass@1），显著优于依赖通用shell的最先进编码代理。

Conclusion: LLM具备解决构建失败的高层知识，但难以通过通用shell将其转化为有效的底层操作。工具桥接策略通过提供API格式的工具和约束操作空间，弥合了高层推理与底层执行之间的差距。

Abstract: Android is the largest mobile platform, yet automatically building
applications remains a practical challenge. While Large Language Models (LLMs)
show promise for code repair, their use for fixing Android build errors remains
underexplored. To address this gap, we first introduce AndroidBuildBench, a
benchmark of 1,019 build failures curated from the commit histories of 43
open-source Android projects. Each problem is paired with a verified solution
from a subsequent commit, ensuring that fixes are feasible. Second, we propose
GradleFixer, an LLM agent with domain-specific tools for inspecting and
manipulating the Gradle build environment. GradleFixer achieves a resolve rate
of 81.4% (pass@1), significantly outperforming a state-of-the-art coding agent
that relies on a general-purpose shell. GradleFixer's success suggests that
while LLMs possess the high-level knowledge to solve these failures, they
struggle to translate this knowledge into effective low-level actions using a
general-purpose shell. We demonstrate the effectiveness of a strategy we term
Tool Bridging, which replaces general-purpose shell commands with domain-aware
abstractions. We hypothesize this approach works through two mechanisms: 1) it
provides tools in an API-like format that LLMs use more reliably, and 2) it
constrains the action space to relevant operations. This approach bridges the
gap between the model's high-level reasoning and effective low-level execution.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 提出Faver方法，通过函数抽象的可验证中间件简化基于LLM的RTL生成流程，将电路验证细节解耦，使LLM专注于功能实现，提升生成准确率最高达14%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在RTL生成中存在语义鸿沟大、训练数据有限的问题，导致生成准确性不足。借鉴人类设计经验，设计验证结合可提高准确性，但RTL测试平台数据稀缺且与高级语言存在巨大语义差异。

Method: 提出Faver方法，混合LLM友好的代码结构和基于规则的模板，将电路验证细节解耦，让LLM专注于功能实现本身。

Result: 在SFT模型和开源模型上的实验表明，Faver将模型生成准确率提升了最高14%。

Conclusion: Faver方法有效解决了LLM在RTL生成中的验证难题，通过中间件设计显著提升了生成准确性。

Abstract: LLM-based RTL generation is an interesting research direction, as it holds
the potential to liberate the least automated stage in the current chip design.
However, due to the substantial semantic gap between high-level specifications
and RTL, coupled with limited training data, existing models struggle with
generation accuracy. Drawing on human experience, design with verification
helps improving accuracy. However, as the RTL testbench data are even more
scarce, it is not friendly for LLMs. Although LLMs excel at higher-level
languages like Python/C, they have a huge semantic gap from RTL. When
implementing the same functionality, Python/C code and hardware code differ
significantly in the spatiotemporal granularity, requiring the LLM not only to
consider high-level functional semantics but also to ensure the low-level
details align with the circuit code. It is not an easy task. In this paper, we
propose a function abstracted verifiable middleware (Faver) that streamlines
RTL verification in LLM-based workflows. By mixing LLM-friendly code structures
with a rule-based template, Faver decouples the details of circuit
verification, allowing the LLM to focus on the functionality itself. In our
experiments on the SFT model and open-source models, Faver improved the model's
generation accuracy by up to 14%.

TL;DR: 提出基于ReAct范式的可控代码生成多智能体框架，通过四个专业智能体的协作实现高效、精确和可解释的代码生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有代码生成模型在安全性、准确性和可控性方面存在不足，缺乏动态工具集成、透明推理和用户安全控制。

Method: 采用多智能体系统架构，包含规划器、基于ReAct的搜索器、代码生成器和数据提取器四个专业智能体，通过推理轨迹和动作执行的交替实现内外知识融合。

Result: 在多语言测试中表现优异，在SVEN数据集上达到94.8%的安全率，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该框架通过透明推理过程增强用户信任，提高可控性，为复杂代码生成任务提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Code generation models based on large language models (LLMs) have gained wide
adoption, but challenges remain in ensuring safety, accuracy, and
controllability, especially for complex tasks. Existing methods often lack
dynamic integration of external tools, transparent reasoning, and user control
over safety. To address these issues, we propose a controllable code generation
framework utilizing the ReAct paradigm for multi-agent task execution. This
framework is a multi-agent system designed to enable efficient, precise, and
interpretable code generation through dynamic interactions between LLMs and
external resources. The framework adopts a collaborative architecture
comprising four specialized agents: a Planner for task decomposition, a
Searcher that leverages the ReAct framework for reasoning and tool integration,
a CodeGen agent for accurate code generation, and an Extractor for structured
data retrieval. The ReAct-based Searcher alternates between generating
reasoning traces and executing actions, facilitating seamless integration of
internal knowledge with external tools (such as search engines) to enhance
accuracy and user control. Experimental results show the framework's
effectiveness across multiple languages, achieving a 94.8% security rate on the
SVEN dataset with CodeQL, outperforming existing approaches. Its transparent
reasoning process fosters user trust and improves controllability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现代软件团队因知识分散在JIRA工单、开发者讨论和GitHub PR中而导致的相关问题解决延迟问题。

Result: 实验评估显示系统在精度、召回率、解决时间减少和开发者接受度等指标上显著提升解决准确性、修复质量和知识复用。

Conclusion: 该框架为现代DevOps环境提供了统一的数据管道、异构软件工件的索引策略和基于检索证据的解决方案生成模块。

Abstract: Modern software teams frequently encounter delays in resolving recurring or
related issues due to fragmented knowledge scattered across JIRA tickets,
developer discussions, and GitHub pull requests (PRs). To address this
challenge, we propose a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework that
integrates Sentence-Transformers for semantic embeddings with FAISS-based
vector search to deliver context-aware ticket resolution recommendations. The
approach embeds historical JIRA tickets, user comments, and linked PR metadata
to retrieve semantically similar past cases, which are then synthesized by a
Large Language Model (LLM) into grounded and explainable resolution
suggestions. The framework contributes a unified pipeline linking JIRA and
GitHub data, an embedding and FAISS indexing strategy for heterogeneous
software artifacts, and a resolution generation module guided by retrieved
evidence. Experimental evaluation using precision, recall, resolution time
reduction, and developer acceptance metrics shows that the proposed system
significantly improves resolution accuracy, fix quality, and knowledge reuse in
modern DevOps environments.

TL;DR: BigCodeArena是一个用于代码生成的人类评估平台，支持实时执行LLM生成的代码并允许人类与执行过程和结果交互。该平台收集了超过14,000个代码对话会话，并基于这些数据开发了两个基准测试：BigCodeReward和AutoCodeArena。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在代码领域，手动评估LLM生成内容的质量极具挑战性，因为需要理解大量原始代码并模拟代码执行过程。

Method: 基于Chatbot Arena构建BigCodeArena平台，提供全面的实时执行环境，收集多轮代码对话数据，并开发自动评估基准。

Result: 收集了14,000多个代码对话会话，识别了4,700多个带有人类偏好的多轮样本。评估显示大多数LLM在有执行结果时能更好地判断代码偏好。

Conclusion: 专有LLM如GPT-5、Claude-Sonnet-4和Claude-Opus-4在代码生成性能方面仍领先于新兴模型，AutoCodeArena基准能够无需人类参与自动评估LLM的代码质量。

Abstract: Crowdsourced model evaluation platforms, such as Chatbot Arena, enable
real-time evaluation from human perspectives to assess the quality of model
responses. In the coding domain, manually examining the quality of
LLM-generated content is extremely challenging, as it requires understanding
long chunks of raw code and deliberately simulating code execution. To this
end, we introduce BigCodeArena, an open human evaluation platform for code
generation backed by a comprehensive and on-the-fly execution environment.
Built on top of Chatbot Arena, BigCodeArena enables the execution of
LLM-generated code and allows humans to interact with the execution process and
outcomes. We collected over 14,000 raw code-centric conversation sessions
across 10 widely used LLMs, spanning 10 languages and 8 types of execution
environments. Among these conversations, we identified more than 4,700
multi-turn samples with pairwise human preferences. Further analysis uncovers
underexplored preferences of LLMs in fine-grained domains characterized by
tasks, languages, and frameworks. To systematically examine code understanding
and generation capabilities of frontier LLMs, we curated two benchmarks based
on the collected data, namely BigCodeReward and AutoCodeArena. For
BigCodeReward, we post-processed the 4,700 conversations and evaluated the
consistency between reward models and human preferences. The evaluation shows
that most LLMs have superior performance in judging coding preferences when the
execution results are available. Inspired by these findings, we propose
AutoCodeArena, an automatic Elo rating benchmark designed to assess the coding
quality of LLMs without human involvement. We find that proprietary LLMs like
GPT-5, Claude-Sonnet-4, and Claude-Opus-4 still lead in code generation
performance among recent emerging models.

Method: 采用差分进化算法来调优Pynguin框架中DynaMOSA和MIO算法的超参数，并与基础网格搜索进行效率对比。

Result: 调优后的DynaMOSA算法能显著提升测试套件的覆盖率，且差分进化算法比基础网格搜索更高效。

Conclusion: 差分进化是有效的超参数调优方法，能显著改善测试生成算法的性能。

Abstract: Search-based test-generation algorithms have countless configuration options.
Users rarely adjust these options and usually stick to the default values,
which may not lead to the best possible results. Tuning an algorithm's
hyperparameters is a method to find better hyperparameter values, but it
typically comes with a high demand of resources. Meta-heuristic search
algorithms -- that effectively solve the test-generation problem -- have been
proposed as a solution to also efficiently tune parameters. In this work we
explore the use of differential evolution as a means for tuning the
hyperparameters of the DynaMOSA and MIO many-objective search algorithms as
implemented in the Pynguin framework. Our results show that significant
improvement of the resulting test suite's coverage is possible with the tuned
DynaMOSA algorithm and that differential evolution is more efficient than basic
grid search.

*Manojit Chakraborty,Madhusudan Ghosh,Rishabh Gupta*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 提出了一种零样本代码翻译方法，通过标识符替换减少token数量，提高长代码翻译的效率和准确性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在翻译长源代码时受限于上下文窗口，导致翻译不准确，需要解决长代码翻译的挑战

Method: 使用标识符替换技术，将用户给定的长标识符替换为通用占位符，让LLM专注于代码逻辑结构

Result: 实验结果表明该方法保留了语法和层次结构信息，并减少了翻译结果中的token数量

Conclusion: 该方法通过减少token使用和内存占用，提高了长代码翻译的效率和成本效益

Abstract: In the domain of software development, LLMs have been utilized to automate
tasks such as code translation, where source code from one programming language
is translated to another while preserving its functionality. However, LLMs
often struggle with long source codes that don't fit into the context window,
which produces inaccurate translations. To address this, we propose a novel
zero-shot code translation method that incorporates identifier replacement. By
substituting user-given long identifiers with generalized placeholders during
translation, our method allows the LLM to focus on the logical structure of the
code, by reducing token count and memory usage, which improves the efficiency
and cost-effectiveness of long code translation. Our empirical results
demonstrate that our approach preserves syntactical and hierarchical
information and produces translation results with reduced tokens.

TL;DR: 开发了一个名为PyMigTool的端到端Python库迁移工具，结合LLM、静态分析和动态分析，能够自动迁移任意功能相似的Python库之间的代码。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手动库迁移耗时且容易出错，现有自动化技术大多停留在API映射阶段或支持有限的库和代码转换，需要更完整的解决方案。

Method: 使用LLM作为主要迁移引擎，结合静态分析和动态分析，开发了PyMigTool命令行应用程序。

Result: 在717个真实Python应用上评估，PyMigTool能够完全正确地迁移32%的案例，剩余案例中超过一半项目只有14%的迁移相关变更需要开发者修复。

Conclusion: LLM能够有效执行库迁移，结合后处理步骤可以进一步提升性能，PyMigTool为Python库迁移提供了实用的自动化解决方案。

Abstract: Library migration is the process of replacing a library with a similar one in
a software project. Manual library migration is time consuming and error prone,
as it requires developers to understand the Application Programming Interfaces
(API) of both libraries, map equivalent APIs, and perform the necessary code
transformations. Due to the difficulty of the library migration process, most
of the existing automated techniques and tooling stop at the API mapping stage
or support a limited set of libraries and code transformations. In this paper,
we develop an end-to-end solution that can automatically migrate code between
any arbitrary pair of Python libraries that provide similar functionality. Due
to the promising capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in code
generation and transformation, we use LLMs as the primary engine for migration.
Before building the tool, we first study the capabilities of LLMs for library
migration on a benchmark of 321 real-world library migrations. We find that
LLMs can effectively perform library migration, but some post-processing steps
can further improve the performance. Based on this, we develop PyMigTool, a
command line application that combines the power of LLMs, static analysis, and
dynamic analysis to provide accurate library migration. We evaluate PyMigTool
on 717 real-world Python applications that are not from our benchmark. We find
that PyMigTool can migrate 32% of the migrations with complete correctness. Of
the remaining migrations, only 14% of the migration-related changes are left
for developers to fix for more than half of the projects.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 学生在学习编程时经常产生对编程概念的误解，这些误解不仅会导致bug和低效代码，还会阻碍相关概念的学习。

Method: 开发了可扩展的误解基准数据集和大量包含误解的代码样本，引入了两种基于LLM的McMiner方法。

Result: 通过广泛评估表明，Gemini、Claude和GPT系列的模型在发现学生代码中的误解方面表现有效。

Conclusion: LLM模型能够有效识别学生编程中的误解，为编程教育提供了有价值的工具。

Abstract: When learning to code, students often develop misconceptions about various
programming language concepts. These can not only lead to bugs or inefficient
code, but also slow down the learning of related concepts. In this paper, we
introduce McMining, the task of mining programming misconceptions from samples
of code from a student. To enable the training and evaluation of McMining
systems, we develop an extensible benchmark dataset of misconceptions together
with a large set of code samples where these misconceptions are manifested. We
then introduce two LLM-based McMiner approaches and through extensive
evaluations show that models from the Gemini, Claude, and GPT families are
effective at discovering misconceptions in student code.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统软件调试技术在游戏开发中应用有限，游戏开发需要独特的调试技术，如屏幕控制台、调试绘制、调试相机等。

Method: 通过记录20位资深游戏开发者在处理崩溃、对象行为和对象持久性等关键bug时的调试会话，进行主题分析。

Result: 识别了瓶颈调试活动，发现开发者主要时间花在检查游戏工件(36.6%)和复现bug(35.1%)上，并确定了不同专业角色在调试中的协作模式。

Conclusion: 游戏调试需要专门的技术工具，技术角色在调试过程中处于核心地位，不同专业间的有效协作对bug解决至关重要。

Abstract: Conventional debugging techniques used in traditional software are similarly
used when debugging video games. However, the reality of video games require
its own set of unique debugging techniques such as On-Screen Console, Debug
Draws, Debug Camera, Cheats and In-Game Menus, and Data Scrubbing. In this
article, we provide insights from a video game studio on how 20 seasoned
industry game developers debug during the production of a game. Our experiments
rely on the recordings of debugging sessions for the most critical bugs
categorized as Crashes, Object Behaviors, and Object Persistence. In this
paper, we focus on identifying the debugging activities that bottleneck bug
resolution. We also identify the debugging tools used to perform debugging
techniques. Lastly, we present how different disciplines collaborate during
debugging and how technical roles are at the core of debugging. Our thematic
analysis has identified game developers spend 36.6\% of their time inspecting
game artifacts and 35.1\% of their time reproducing the bug locally.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于LLM微调的文件路径检索方法，通过代码感知策略生成训练数据，实现在大型代码库中从自然语言查询直接预测相关文件路径。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统代码搜索方法缺乏语义上下文和跨文件链接理解，而大型语言模型虽然理解自然语言但缺乏仓库特定细节，难以准确回答关于代码功能或bug定位的问题。

Method: 使用Qwen3-8B LLM，通过QLoRA和Unsloth优化进行微调，采用六种基于抽象语法树和仓库内容的代码感知策略生成训练数据，包括单文件提示到分层仓库摘要等多种方法。

Result: 在Python项目中达到91%精确匹配和93%召回率，在PyTorch等大型代码库（约4000个Python文件）上达到59%召回率，明显优于单策略训练。

Conclusion: 多级代码信号帮助LLM理解跨文件上下文，该方法展示了在大型代码库中文件路径检索的可扩展性，为检索与基于LLM的代码智能集成提供了基础。

Abstract: Modern codebases make it hard for developers and AI coding assistants to find
the right source files when answering questions like "How does this feature
work?" or "Where was the bug introduced?" Traditional code search (keyword or
IR based) often misses semantic context and cross file links, while large
language models (LLMs) understand natural language but lack repository specific
detail. We present a method for file path retrieval that fine tunes a strong
LLM (Qwen3-8B) with QLoRA and Unsloth optimizations to predict relevant file
paths directly from a natural language query. To build training data, we
introduce six code aware strategies that use abstract syntax tree (AST)
structure and repository content to generate realistic question-answer pairs,
where answers are sets of file paths. The strategies range from single file
prompts to hierarchical repository summaries, providing broad coverage. We fine
tune on Python projects including Flask, Click, Jinja, FastAPI, and PyTorch,
and obtain high retrieval accuracy: up to 91\% exact match and 93\% recall on
held out queries, clearly beating single strategy training. On a large codebase
like PyTorch (about 4,000 Python files), the model reaches 59\% recall, showing
scalability. We analyze how multi level code signals help the LLM reason over
cross file context and discuss dataset design, limits (for example, context
length in very large repos), and future integration of retrieval with LLM based
code intelligence.

Motivation: 大型软件仓库的复杂性使得理解和自动化开发变得困难，需要一种能够捕获项目架构和语义关系的结构化表示方法。

Method: 构建向量化知识图谱，编码包含、实现、引用、调用和继承等语法关系，并用LLM生成的摘要和向量嵌入增强节点。采用混合检索管道结合语义检索和图感知扩展，使用基于LLM的助手制定受限的只读图请求。

Result: 系统能够成功将软件仓库转换为结构化知识图谱，捕获语义关系并支持自动化开发流程。

Conclusion: 该仓库分解系统为大型软件项目提供了有效的结构化表示，通过知识图谱和LLM技术的结合实现了更高程度的开发自动化。

Abstract: We present a repository decomposition system that converts large software
repositories into a vectorized knowledge graph which mirrors project
architectural and semantic structure, capturing semantic relationships and
allowing a significant level of automatization of further repository
development. The graph encodes syntactic relations such as containment,
implementation, references, calls, and inheritance, and augments nodes with
LLM-derived summaries and vector embeddings. A hybrid retrieval pipeline
combines semantic retrieval with graph-aware expansion, and an LLM-based
assistant formulates constrained, read-only graph requests and produces
human-oriented explanations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法多为高层指导，实施耗时且依赖团队适应性，且多关注设计或实现阶段，而可持续性评估应从需求工程阶段开始。

Method: SEER框架分三个阶段：从通用分类法中识别特定软件产品的可持续性需求；基于识别的SR评估系统需求的可持续性；优化未能满足任何SR的系统需求。使用LLM推理能力和代理RAG方法实现。

Result: 在四个不同领域的软件项目上进行实验，使用Gemini 2.5推理模型生成的结果表明，该方法能准确识别跨不同领域的广泛可持续性问题。

Conclusion: SEER框架在软件开发早期阶段有效解决了可持续性问题，能够准确识别多样化的可持续性关注点。

Abstract: The rapid expansion of software development has significant environmental,
technical, social, and economic impacts. Achieving the United Nations
Sustainable Development Goals by 2030 compels developers to adopt sustainable
practices. Existing methods mostly offer high-level guidelines, which are
time-consuming to implement and rely on team adaptability. Moreover, they focus
on design or implementation, while sustainability assessment should start at
the requirements engineering phase. In this paper, we introduce SEER, a
framework which addresses sustainability concerns in the early software
development phase. The framework operates in three stages: (i) it identifies
sustainability requirements (SRs) relevant to a specific software product from
a general taxonomy; (ii) it evaluates how sustainable system requirements are
based on the identified SRs; and (iii) it optimizes system requirements that
fail to satisfy any SR. The framework is implemented using the reasoning
capabilities of large language models and the agentic RAG (Retrieval Augmented
Generation) approach. SEER has been experimented on four software projects from
different domains. Results generated using Gemini 2.5 reasoning model
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in accurately
identifying a broad range of sustainability concerns across diverse domains.

Motivation: 现有可持续性需求研究存在碎片化、局限于特定维度或应用领域的问题，缺乏统一的综合性分类法，阻碍了软件工程社区对可持续性的系统处理。

Method: 采用系统文献综述方法，从最新研究中提取和组织可持续性需求，构建跨四个维度的分类法，并提供定义、指标、度量方法以及相关性矩阵。

Result: 开发了一个全面的可持续性需求分类法，包含各维度的明确定义、相关指标和度量方法，并展示了不同维度类别间的正负影响关系矩阵。

Conclusion: 该分类法为软件开发者和研究人员提供了系统化参考，有助于有效制定、管理和协调可持续软件开发中的权衡关系。

Abstract: Software systems are a significant contributor to global sustainability
concerns, demanding that environmental, social, technical, and economic factors
be systematically addressed from the initial requirements engineering phase.
Although existing research provides various sustainability requirements (SRs),
these contributions are often fragmented, specific to certain dimensions, or
limited to particular application domains, resulting in a critical lack of a
unified, comprehensive taxonomy for the software engineering community. To
address this gap, this research conducts a Systematic Literature Review (SLR)
to extract and organize sustainability requirements from the state-of-the-art.
The primary contribution is a comprehensive taxonomy of SRs across the four
dimensions of sustainability (environmental, technical, social, and economic).
For each identified category, we provide clear definitions, associated metrics,
and measures. Furthermore, we depict a correlation matrix that projects the
positive and negative influences (synergies and conflicts) among categories
across different dimensions. This systematized reference assists both software
developers and researchers in effectively formulating, managing, and
reconciling trade-offs within sustainable software development.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的基准测试框架，通过将现有正式基准转化为现实用户查询来更准确地评估软件工程代理在真实场景中的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于GitHub问题的基准测试无法准确反映开发者在IDE中与聊天式编码助手的真实交互方式，导致对代理实际能力的系统性高估。

Method: 通过分析开发者与聊天式代理的交互模式，将现有正式基准转化为现实用户查询，并应用于多个基准测试集。

Result: 发现现有基准显著高估了代理能力，在公共基准上高估超过50%，在内部基准上高估约10-16%。

Conclusion: 这项工作通过基准变异技术为评估交互式聊天软件工程代理建立了新范式。

Abstract: Current benchmarks for evaluating software engineering agents, such as
SWE-Bench Verified, are predominantly derived from GitHub issues and fail to
accurately reflect how developers interact with chat-based coding assistants in
integrated development environments (IDEs). We posit that this mismatch leads
to a systematic overestimation of agent's capabilities in real-world scenarios,
especially bug fixing. We introduce a novel benchmarking framework that
transforms existing formal benchmarks into realistic user queries through
systematic analysis of developer interaction patterns with chat-based agents.
Our methodology is flexible and can be easily extended to existing benchmarks.
In this paper, we apply our testing framework to SWE-Bench Verified, the
TypeScript subset of Multi-SWE-Bench and a private benchmark, SWE-Bench C# and
transform formal GitHub issue descriptions into realistic user-style queries
based on telemetry analysis of a popular chat-based agent interactions. Our
findings reveal that existing benchmarks significantly overestimate agent
capabilities for some models by >50% over baseline performance for public
benchmarks and ~10-16% for our internal benchmark. This work establishes a new
paradigm for evaluating interactive chat-based software engineering agents
through benchmark mutation techniques.

Motivation: 了解LLMs在实际软件开发中的使用情况和从业者对其优缺点的看法，填补对LLM实际应用认知的空白。

Method: 通过对全球131名软件从业者进行调查，收集关于LLM使用实践的定性数据。

Result: 从业者报告LLMs提高了生产力、减轻了认知负担、加速了学习，但也担忧输出不准确、上下文理解有限和伦理风险。大多数开发者将LLMs视为辅助工具而非独立解决方案。

Conclusion: LLMs在软件工程中显示出巨大潜力，但需要谨慎使用。研究为未来LLM研究和负责任应用提供了实践者视角的重要参考。

Abstract: Large Language Models have quickly become a central component of modern
software development workflows, and software practitioners are increasingly
integrating LLMs into various stages of the software development lifecycle.
Despite the growing presence of LLMs, there is still a limited understanding of
how these tools are actually used in practice and how professionals perceive
their benefits and limitations. This paper presents preliminary findings from a
global survey of 131 software practitioners. Our results reveal how LLMs are
utilized for various coding-specific tasks. Software professionals report
benefits such as increased productivity, reduced cognitive load, and faster
learning, but also raise concerns about LLMs' inaccurate outputs, limited
context awareness, and associated ethical risks. Most developers treat LLMs as
assistive tools rather than standalone solutions, reflecting a cautious yet
practical approach to their integration. Our findings provide an early,
practitioner-focused perspective on LLM adoption, highlighting key
considerations for future research and responsible use in software engineering.

Motivation: 随着计算机系统日益庞大复杂，系统专家需要向系统新手有效传达程序工作原理。现有的代码内注释缺乏全局上下文，而设计文档又缺乏与代码的具体连接。

Method: 开发了TReX工具，用于创建交互式、可视化的文学化追踪文档，这些文档通过构造保证与程序语义的一致性。

Result: 已使用TReX为大型系统软件（包括Linux内核、Git源代码控制系统和GCC编译器）的组件编写了文学化追踪文档。

Conclusion: 文学化追踪通过具体执行追踪补充了代码注释和设计文档的不足，提供了一种有效的程序文档方法。

Abstract: As computer systems grow ever larger and more complex, a crucial task in
software development is for one person (the system expert) to communicate to
another (the system novice) how a certain program works. This paper reports on
the author's experiences with a paradigm for program documentation that we call
literate tracing. A literate trace explains a software system using annotated,
concrete execution traces of the system. Literate traces complement both
in-code comments (which often lack global context) and out-of-band design docs
(which often lack a concrete connection to the code). We also describe TReX,
our tool for making literate traces that are interactive, visual, and
guaranteed by construction to be faithful to the program semantics. We have
used TReX to write literate traces explaining components of large systems
software including the Linux kernel, Git source control system, and GCC
compiler.

TL;DR: PynguinML通过从API文档中提取约束条件，改进Pynguin测试生成器，为机器学习API生成合规输入，显著提高代码覆盖率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器学习库如PyTorch和TensorFlow对输入有严格约束，现有测试生成工具如Pynguin不了解这些约束，导致测试失败和代码覆盖率低。

Method: 从官方API文档中提取约束条件，改进Pynguin测试生成器以生成符合约束的输入数据。

Result: 在PyTorch和TensorFlow的165个模块上评估，PynguinML相比Pynguin实现了高达63.9%的代码覆盖率提升。

Conclusion: 利用API文档中的约束条件可以显著提高机器学习库测试生成工具的有效性。

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) libraries such as PyTorch and TensorFlow are essential
for a wide range of modern applications. Ensuring the correctness of ML
libraries through testing is crucial. However, ML APIs often impose strict
input constraints involving complex data structures such as tensors. Automated
test generation tools such as Pynguin are not aware of these constraints and
often create non-compliant inputs. This leads to early test failures and
limited code coverage. Prior work has investigated extracting constraints from
official API documentation. In this paper, we present PynguinML, an approach
that improves the Pynguin test generator to leverage these constraints to
generate compliant inputs for ML APIs, enabling more thorough testing and
higher code coverage. Our evaluation is based on 165 modules from PyTorch and
TensorFlow, comparing PynguinML against Pynguin. The results show that
PynguinML significantly improves test effectiveness, achieving up to 63.9 %
higher code coverage.

Motivation: 当前数字孪生应用多为器官特异性或局限于孤立数据类型，缺乏统一且隐私保护的框架来支持个性化慢性护理。

Method: 使用OWL 2.0实现本体驱动的数字孪生框架，围绕模块化蓝图构建，包括患者、疾病诊断、治疗随访、轨迹、安全、路径和不良事件等模块，通过专家研讨会、问卷和真实世界研究进行迭代验证。

Conclusion: PMDT通过弥合数据碎片化和语义标准化差距，为下一代数字健康生态系统提供了验证基础，推动慢性护理向主动、持续优化和公平管理转变。

Abstract: Personalized chronic care requires the integration of multimodal health data
to enable precise, adaptive, and preventive decision-making. Yet most current
digital twin (DT) applications remain organ-specific or tied to isolated data
types, lacking a unified and privacy-preserving foundation. This paper
introduces the Patient Medical Digital Twin (PMDT), an ontology-driven in
silico patient framework that integrates physiological, psychosocial,
behavioral, and genomic information into a coherent, extensible model.
Implemented in OWL 2.0, the PMDT ensures semantic interoperability, supports
automated reasoning, and enables reuse across diverse clinical contexts. Its
ontology is structured around modular Blueprints (patient, disease and
diagnosis, treatment and follow-up, trajectories, safety, pathways, and adverse
events), formalized through dedicated conceptual views. These were iteratively
refined and validated through expert workshops, questionnaires, and a pilot
study in the EU H2020 QUALITOP project with real-world immunotherapy patients.
Evaluation confirmed ontology coverage, reasoning correctness, usability, and
GDPR compliance. Results demonstrate the PMDT's ability to unify heterogeneous
data, operationalize competency questions, and support descriptive, predictive,
and prescriptive analytics in a federated, privacy-preserving manner. By
bridging gaps in data fragmentation and semantic standardization, the PMDT
provides a validated foundation for next-generation digital health ecosystems,
transforming chronic care toward proactive, continuously optimized, and
equitable management.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to transform healthcare by
supporting more accurate diagnoses and personalized treatments. However, its
adoption in practice remains constrained by fragmented data sources, strict
privacy rules, and the technical complexity of building reliable clinical
systems. To address these challenges, we introduce a model driven engineering
(MDE) framework designed specifically for healthcare AI. The framework relies
on formal metamodels, domain-specific languages (DSLs), and automated
transformations to move from high level specifications to running software. At
its core is the Medical Interoperability Language (MILA), a graphical DSL that
enables clinicians and data scientists to define queries and machine learning
pipelines using shared ontologies. When combined with a federated learning
architecture, MILA allows institutions to collaborate without exchanging raw
patient data, ensuring semantic consistency across sites while preserving
privacy. We evaluate this approach in a multi center cancer immunotherapy
study. The generated pipelines delivered strong predictive performance, with
support vector machines achieving up to 98.5 percent and 98.3 percent accuracy
in key tasks, while substantially reducing manual coding effort. These findings
suggest that MDE principles metamodeling, semantic integration, and automated
code generation can provide a practical path toward interoperable,
reproducible, and trustworthy digital health platforms.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong performance in automated
source-to-target code translation through pretraining on extensive code
corpora. However, mainstream LLM-based code translation methods suffer from two
critical limitations. First, they are highly sensitive to language-specific
features, which often introduce source-language syntax or lexicon into the
output, leading to syntactic confusion. Second, they lack fine-grained semantic
alignment due to an over-reliance on function-level parallel datasets,
resulting in semantic misalignment between the translated code and the original
source. To overcome these limitations, we propose TIT, a Tree-structured
Instruction Tuning paradigm for LLM-based code translation. Specifically, TIT
consists of three modules. First, to mitigate syntactic confusion, the
syntactic information representation module integrates language-agnostic
syntactic features via structured parsing. Then, to generate high-quality
fine-grained parallel data, the fine-grained parallel dataset augmentation
module aligns nodes with code segments through statement-level segmentation and
contrastive matching. Finally, we leverage the dual-stage tree instruction
tuning module to alleviate the contextual processing burden on the LLM caused
by the introduction of syntactic information. The first stage employs
syntax-aware fine-tuning to enable the LLM to autonomously comprehend
structured syntactic information, while the second stage utilizes code
generation fine-tuning to guide the model in generating accurate target code
based on function-level syntactic dependencies. The experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms existing
approaches in multiple LLMs, achieving a success rate 1.22x-1.75x higher in
code translation while markedly reducing syntactic confusion.

### [385] [Unending Sequential Auctions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08742)
*Amir Ban*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 研究具有不确定退出的重复序贯拍卖的稳态均衡，发现不确定性使阈值变得模糊，对高低价值竞标者都有利，但降低拍卖者收益。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实中存在大量重复进行的同质物品序贯拍卖，竞标者面临退出不确定性，需要研究这种不确定性对均衡的影响。

Method: 将序贯拍卖建模为马尔可夫过程，分析存在竞标者退出概率时的稳态均衡特性。

Result: 无不确定性时均衡类似固定价格机制；有不确定性时阈值模糊，低价值竞标者获胜概率增加，高价值竞标者预期效用提升，但拍卖者收益下降。

Conclusion: 竞标者退出不确定性改变了序贯拍卖的均衡结构，对竞标者有利但对拍卖者不利。

Abstract: Sequential auctions for identical items with unit-demand, private-value
buyers are common and often occur periodically without end, as new bidders
replace departing ones. We model bidder uncertainty by introducing a
probability that a bidder must exit the auction in each period. Treating the
sequential auction as a Markov process, we demonstrate the existence of a
unique steady state.
  In the absence of uncertainty, the steady state resembles a posted-price
mechanism: bidders with values above a threshold almost surely win items by
repeatedly bidding the threshold price, while those below the threshold almost
surely do not. The equilibrium price corresponds to the threshold value that
balances supply (bidders with values above the threshold) and demand (auction
winners).
  When uncertainty is introduced, the threshold value persists but becomes less
precise, growing "fuzzier" as uncertainty increases. This uncertainty benefits
low-value bidders, those below the threshold, by giving them a significant
chance of winning. Surprisingly, high-value bidders also benefit from
uncertainty, up to a certain value limit, as it lowers equilibrium bids and
increases their expected utility. On the other hand, this bidder uncertainty
often reduces the auctioneer's utility.

TL;DR: 提出RobustBid方法，通过鲁棒优化技术处理CTR和CVR预测中的不确定性，在预测误差较大时提供更优的出价策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数字拍卖系统中CTR和CVR的预测不确定性直接影响广告主收益和出价策略，需要开发能够应对这种不确定性的鲁棒自动出价方法。

Method: 利用先进的鲁棒优化技术，防止CTR/CVR估计扰动时出现大的出价错误，并推导出鲁棒优化问题的解析解以实现运行时效率。

Result: 在合成数据集、iPinYou和BAT基准测试中，与无鲁棒性基线和RiskBid算法相比，RobustBid在CTR/CVR预测存在大扰动时能获得更大的总转化量(TCV)和更低的平均每次点击成本(CPC_avg)。

Conclusion: RobustBid方法能有效处理CTR和CVR预测中的不确定性，在预测误差较大时提供更优的出价性能。

Abstract: Managing millions of digital auctions is an essential task for modern
advertising auction systems. The main approach to managing digital auctions is
an autobidding approach, which depends on the Click-Through Rate and Conversion
Rate values. While these quantities are estimated with ML models, their
prediction uncertainty directly impacts advertisers' revenue and bidding
strategies. To address this issue, we propose RobustBid, an efficient method
for robust autobidding taking into account uncertainty in CTR and CVR
predictions. Our approach leverages advanced, robust optimization techniques to
prevent large errors in bids if the estimates of CTR/CVR are perturbed. We
derive the analytical solution of the stated robust optimization problem, which
leads to the runtime efficiency of the RobustBid method. The synthetic,
iPinYou, and BAT benchmarks are used in our experimental evaluation of
RobustBid. We compare our method with the non-robust baseline and the RiskBid
algorithm in terms of total conversion volume (TCV) and average cost-per-click
($CPC_{avg}$) performance metrics. The experiments demonstrate that RobustBid
provides bids that yield larger TCV and smaller $CPC_{avg}$ than competitors in
the case of large perturbations in CTR/CVR predictions.

TL;DR: 数据估值方法存在隐藏成本，即边际价值接近零的贡献者无法获得报酬。本文通过信息披露博弈模型，展示了数据联盟如何通过差分隐私机制渐进披露数据，并证明数据估值本质上会产生明确的获取成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统数据估值方法直接作为支付机制时，边际价值接近零的贡献者无法获得报酬，即使他们的数据也需要收集和评估，这产生了隐藏成本。

Method: 引入信息披露博弈模型，数据联盟通过添加拉普拉斯噪声的差分隐私机制渐进披露数据，使用数据Shapley值和多臂老虎机探索策略进行模拟。

Result: 在Yelp评论有用性预测任务中，模拟显示数据估值确实会产生明确的获取成本，且数据联盟的集体披露策略会影响成本在成员间的分配。

Conclusion: 数据估值方法需要考虑数据获取的隐藏成本，数据联盟的集体披露策略能够改变成本分配方式，为更公平的数据价值分配提供理论基础。

Abstract: Data valuation methods assign marginal utility to each data point that has
contributed to the training of a machine learning model. If used directly as a
payout mechanism, this creates a hidden cost of valuation, in which
contributors with near-zero marginal value would receive nothing, even though
their data had to be collected and assessed. To better formalize this cost, we
introduce a conceptual and game-theoretic model, the Information Disclosure
Game, between a Data Union (sometimes also called a data trust), a member-run
agent representing contributors, and a Data Consumer (e.g., a platform). After
first aggregating members' data, the DU releases information progressively by
adding Laplacian noise under a differentially-private mechanism. Through
simulations with strategies guided by data Shapley values and multi-armed
bandit exploration, we demonstrate on a Yelp review helpfulness prediction task
that data valuation inherently incurs an explicit acquisition cost and that the
DU's collective disclosure policy changes how this cost is distributed across
members.

Motivation: 在数字广告牌投放中，影响提供商需要将广告位分配给广告商，如果提供的影响超过或低于广告商需求都会造成损失（遗憾），目标是找到最小化总遗憾的分配方案。

Method: 提出两种方法：1) 预算有效贪心方法，以增量贪心方式选择广告位；2) 随机化预算有效贪心方法，在样本广告位上应用贪心策略以减少计算量。

Result: 实验表明，随机化预算有效贪心方法在合理计算时间内有效最小化遗憾。

Conclusion: 随机化预算有效贪心方法在计算效率和遗憾最小化之间取得了良好平衡，是解决广告牌分配问题的有效方案。

Abstract: In a typical \emph{billboard advertisement} technique, a number of digital
billboards are owned by an \emph{influence provider}, and several commercial
houses approach the influence provider for a specific number of views of their
advertisement content on a payment basis. If the influence provider provides
the demanded or more influence, then he will receive the full payment else a
partial payment. In the context of an influence provider, if he provides more
or less than the advertisers demanded influence, it is a loss for him. This is
formalized as 'Regret', and naturally, in the context of the influence
provider, the goal will be to allocate the billboard slots among the
advertisers such that the total regret is minimized. In this paper, we study
this problem as a discrete optimization problem and propose two solution
approaches. The first one selects the billboard slots from the available ones
in an incremental greedy manner, and we call this method the Budget Effective
Greedy approach. In the second one, we introduce randomness in the first one,
where we do it for a sample of slots instead of calculating the marginal gains
of all the billboard slots. We analyze both algorithms to understand their time
and space complexity. We implement them with real-life datasets and conduct a
number of experiments. We observe that the randomized budget effective greedy
approach takes reasonable computational time while minimizing the regret.

TL;DR: 提出了PBR框架，在检索前通过个性化查询扩展解决RAG系统中的个性化语义差距问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有查询扩展方法采用统一策略，忽略了用户特定的表达风格、偏好和历史上下文，导致相同文本查询在不同用户间表达完全不同的意图

Method: PBR框架包含两个组件：P-PRF使用用户历史生成风格对齐的伪反馈来模拟用户表达风格；P-Anchor在用户语料上执行基于图的结构对齐以捕获其语义结构

Result: 在两个个性化基准测试中，PBR始终优于强基线方法，在PersonaBench上检索器性能提升高达10%

Conclusion: 在检索前建模个性化对于缩小用户自适应RAG系统中的语义差距具有重要价值

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) critically depends on effective query
expansion to retrieve relevant information. However, existing expansion methods
adopt uniform strategies that overlook user-specific semantics, ignoring
individual expression styles, preferences, and historical context. In practice,
identical queries in text can express vastly different intentions across users.
This representational rigidity limits the ability of current RAG systems to
generalize effectively in personalized settings. Specifically, we identify two
core challenges for personalization: 1) user expression styles are inherently
diverse, making it difficult for standard expansions to preserve personalized
intent. 2) user corpora induce heterogeneous semantic structures-varying in
topical focus and lexical organization-which hinders the effective anchoring of
expanded queries within the user's corpora space. To address these challenges,
we propose Personalize Before Retrieve (PBR), a framework that incorporates
user-specific signals into query expansion prior to retrieval. PBR consists of
two components: P-PRF, which generates stylistically aligned pseudo feedback
using user history for simulating user expression style, and P-Anchor, which
performs graph-based structure alignment over user corpora to capture its
structure. Together, they produce personalized query representations tailored
for retrieval. Experiments on two personalized benchmarks show that PBR
consistently outperforms strong baselines, with up to 10% gains on PersonaBench
across retrievers. Our findings demonstrate the value of modeling
personalization before retrieval to close the semantic gap in user-adaptive RAG
systems. Our code is available at https://github.com/Zhang-Yingyi/PBR-code.

Motivation: 电商行业增长加剧了黑产与风险管理团队的对抗，大量案件分析给分析师带来沉重负担，且分析师个体差异阻碍了标准化工作流程的建立。

Method: 1) 从多模态数据提取风险管理知识构建领域知识库；2) 基于数据飞轮范式构建智能平台，整合日常操作、专家标注和模型评估；3) 引入Reflect & Refine模块与领域知识库协作，建立快速响应机制。

Conclusion: SHERLOCK框架有效解决了风险调查中的工作负担和标准化问题，通过LLM推理能力和领域知识结合，为电商风险管理提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: The growth of the e-commerce industry has intensified the adversarial
dynamics between shadow economy actors and risk management teams. Companies
often conduct risk investigations into suspicious cases to identify emerging
fraud patterns, thereby enhancing both preemptive risk prevention and post-hoc
governance. However, the sheer volume of case analyses imposes a substantial
workload on risk management analysts, as each case requires the integration of
long-term expert experience and meticulous scrutiny across multiple risk
dimensions. Additionally, individual disparities among analysts hinder the
establishment of uniform and high-standard workflows. To address these
challenges, we propose the SHERLOCK framework, which leverages the reasoning
capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to assist analysts in risk
investigations. Our approach consists of three primary components: (1)
extracting risk management knowledge from multi-modal data and constructing a
domain knowledge base (KB), (2) building an intelligent platform guided by the
data flywheel paradigm that integrates daily operations, expert annotations,
and model evaluations, with iteratively fine-tuning for preference alignment,
and (3) introducing a Reflect & Refine (R&R) module that collaborates with the
domain KB to establish a rapid response mechanism for evolving risk patterns.
Experiments conducted on the real-world transaction dataset from JD.com
demonstrate that our method significantly improves the precision of both
factual alignment and risk localization within the LLM analysis results.
Deployment of the SHERLOCK-based LLM system on JD.com has substantially
enhanced the efficiency of case investigation workflows for risk managers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大型推理模型推动了在LLM重排序器中加入显式推理链的趋势，但推理对排序任务的有效性仍未被充分探索。

Method: 在点式和列表式设置下，分别采用监督微调和强化学习方法，使用多样化基准（包括推理密集型数据集BRIGHT和标准IR基准BEIR）进行系统评估。

Result: 推理增强的重排序器在所有设置下都表现不如直接预测排名的模型，存在三个核心局限性：点式重排序中推理破坏校准并偏向正类；列表式重排序中推理提高域内拟合但增加方差且泛化能力差；直接微调的重排序器更稳定有效。

Conclusion: 显式推理并非普遍有益于重排序任务，未来研究方向包括点式重排序的校准感知评分和列表式重排序中简洁、有针对性的推理策略设计。

Abstract: Document reranking is a key component in information retrieval (IR), aimed at
refining initial retrieval results to improve ranking quality for downstream
tasks. Recent studies--motivated by large reasoning models (LRMs)--have begun
incorporating explicit chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning into LLM-based
rerankers. However, the effectiveness of such reasoning for ranking tasks
remains underexplored. In this work, we present the first systematic study of
reasoning in reranking across both pointwise and listwise settings, under both
supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning. Using diverse benchmarks,
including reasoning-intensive datasets (BRIGHT) and standard IR benchmarks
(BEIR), we find that reasoning-augmented rerankers consistently underperform
their direct counterparts that predict rankings without CoT, despite
substantially higher inference costs. Our analysis reveals three core
limitations: (i) in pointwise rerankers, reasoning breaks calibration and
biases models toward the positive class, raising TPR but lowering TNR, which
inflates false positives and degrades ranking in negative-dominant pools; (ii)
in listwise rerankers, reasoning improves in-domain fit but increases variance
and fails to generalize out-of-domain, even when reinforcement learning
shortens rationales; and (iii) overall, directly fine-tuned rerankers remain
more stable, effective, and robust. These findings challenge the assumption
that explicit reasoning is universally beneficial for reranking. We conclude by
highlighting future directions, including calibration-aware scoring for
pointwise rerankers and the design of concise, targeted reasoning strategies to
mitigate overfitting and overthinking in listwise rerankers.

Conclusion: GDA4Rec框架能够生成高质量增强视图，提供鲁棒的自监督信号，学习更有效和信息丰富的嵌入。

Abstract: Recommendation systems have become indispensable in various online platforms,
from e-commerce to streaming services. A fundamental challenge in this domain
is learning effective embeddings from sparse user-item interactions. While
contrastive learning has recently emerged as a promising solution to this
issue, generating augmented views for contrastive learning through most
existing random data augmentation methods often leads to the alteration of
original semantic information. In this paper, we propose a novel framework,
GDA4Rec (Generative Data Augmentation in graph contrastive learning for
Recommendation) to generate high-quality augmented views and provide robust
self-supervised signals. Specifically, we employ a noise generation module that
leverages deep generative models to approximate the distribution of original
data for data augmentation. Additionally, GDA4Rec further extracts an item
complement matrix to characterize the latent correlations between items and
provide additional self-supervised signals. Lastly, a joint objective that
integrates recommendation, data augmentation and contrastive learning is used
to enforce the model to learn more effective and informative embeddings.
Extensive experiments are conducted on three public datasets to demonstrate the
superiority of the model. The code is available at:

Motivation: 传统新闻媒体在采用个性化推荐技术时面临平衡技术创新与核心编辑价值观的挑战，需要找到既能满足用户需求又能维护新闻专业性的解决方案。

Method: 通过在挪威主要传统新闻机构网站上进行的A/B测试，评估受控个性化策略（结合编辑精选和算法推荐）的效果。

Result: 受控个性化显著提高了点击率，降低了用户导航成本，增加了内容多样性，提升了内容目录覆盖率，并减少了流行度偏见。

Conclusion: 受控个性化能够成功协调用户需求与编辑目标，为传统媒体在维护新闻价值观的同时采用个性化技术提供了可行路径。

Abstract: Personalized news recommendations have become a standard feature of large
news aggregation services, optimizing user engagement through automated content
selection. In contrast, legacy news media often approach personalization
cautiously, striving to balance technological innovation with core editorial
values. As a result, online platforms of traditional news outlets typically
combine editorially curated content with algorithmically selected articles - a
strategy we term controlled personalization. In this industry paper, we
evaluate the effectiveness of controlled personalization through an A/B test
conducted on the website of a major Norwegian legacy news organization. Our
findings indicate that even a modest level of personalization yields
substantial benefits. Specifically, we observe that users exposed to
personalized content demonstrate higher click-through rates and reduced
navigation effort, suggesting improved discovery of relevant content. Moreover,
our analysis reveals that controlled personalization contributes to greater
content diversity and catalog coverage and in addition reduces popularity bias.
Overall, our results suggest that controlled personalization can successfully
align user needs with editorial goals, offering a viable path for legacy media
to adopt personalization technologies while upholding journalistic values.

Result: 在公开基准和大规模生产数据集上均超越现有方法，在线A/B测试中CVR提升18.421%，成本仅增加1.251%。

Conclusion: HSRL为基于强化学习的推荐系统提供了一个可扩展的范式。

Abstract: Recommender Systems (RS) are fundamental to modern online services. While
most existing approaches optimize for short-term engagement, recent work has
begun to explore reinforcement learning (RL) to model long-term user value.
However, these efforts face significant challenges due to the vast, dynamic
action spaces inherent in recommendation, which hinder stable policy learning.
To resolve this bottleneck, we introduce Hierarchical Semantic RL (HSRL), which
reframes RL-based recommendation over a fixed Semantic Action Space (SAS). HSRL
encodes items as Semantic IDs (SIDs) for policy learning, and maps SIDs back to
their original items via a fixed, invertible lookup during execution. To align
decision-making with SID generation, the Hierarchical Policy Network (HPN)
operates in a coarse-to-fine manner, employing hierarchical residual state
modeling to refine each level's context from the previous level's residual,
thereby stabilizing training and reducing representation-decision mismatch. In
parallel, a Multi-level Critic (MLC) provides token-level value estimates,
enabling fine-grained credit assignment. Across public benchmarks and a
large-scale production dataset from a leading Chinese short-video advertising
platform, HSRL consistently surpasses state-of-the-art baselines. In online
deployment over a seven-day A/B testing, it delivers an 18.421% CVR lift with
only a 1.251% increase in cost, supporting HSRL as a scalable paradigm for
RL-based recommendation. Our code is released at

Conclusion: ChoirRec通过LLMs构建语义用户群组，有效解决了低活跃用户转化率预测的挑战，在工业级电商平台上具有显著实用价值。

Abstract: Accurately predicting conversion rates (CVR) for low-activity users remains a
fundamental challenge in large-scale e-commerce recommender systems.Existing
approaches face three critical limitations: (i) reliance on noisy and
unreliable behavioral signals; (ii) insufficient user-level information due to
the lack of diverse interaction data; and (iii) a systemic training bias toward
high-activity users that overshadows the needs of low-activity users.To address
these challenges, we propose ChoirRec, a novel framework that leverages the
semantic capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to construct semantic
user groups and enhance CVR prediction for low-activity users.With a
dual-channel architecture designed for robust cross-user knowledge transfer,
ChoirRec comprises three components: (i) a Semantic Group Generation module
that utilizes LLMs to form reliable, cross-activity user clusters, thereby
filtering out noisy signals; (ii) a Group-aware Hierarchical Representation
module that enriches sparse user embeddings with informative group-level priors
to mitigate data insufficiency; and (iii) a Group-aware Multi-granularity
Modual that employs a dual-channel architecture and adaptive fusion mechanism
to ensure effective learning and utilization of group knowledge. We conduct
extensive offline and online experiments on Taobao, a leading industrial-scale
e-commerce platform.ChoirRec improves GAUC by 1.16\% in offline evaluations,
while online A/B testing reveals a 7.24\% increase in order volume,
highlighting its substantial practical value in real-world applications.

Result: 评估了4类多模态检索系统和14个前沿模型。文本嵌入模型Qwen3-Embedding结合LLM生成的图像描述表现最佳，表明多模态检索模型仍有很大改进空间。最新多模态模型在专家领域查询上表现良好，但在推理密集型任务上仍有不足。

Abstract: We introduce MRMR, the first expert-level multidisciplinary multimodal
retrieval benchmark requiring intensive reasoning. MRMR contains 1,502 queries
spanning 23 domains, with positive documents carefully verified by human
experts. Compared to prior benchmarks, MRMR introduces three key advancements.
First, it challenges retrieval systems across diverse areas of expertise,
enabling fine-grained model comparison across domains. Second, queries are
reasoning-intensive, with images requiring deeper interpretation such as
diagnosing microscopic slides. We further introduce Contradiction Retrieval, a
novel task requiring models to identify conflicting concepts. Finally, queries
and documents are constructed as image-text interleaved sequences. Unlike
earlier benchmarks restricted to single images or unimodal documents, MRMR
offers a realistic setting with multi-image queries and mixed-modality corpus
documents. We conduct an extensive evaluation of 4 categories of multimodal
retrieval systems and 14 frontier models on MRMR. The text embedding model
Qwen3-Embedding with LLM-generated image captions achieves the highest
performance, highlighting substantial room for improving multimodal retrieval
models. Although latest multimodal models such as Ops-MM-Embedding perform
competitively on expert-domain queries, they fall short on reasoning-intensive
tasks. We believe that MRMR paves the way for advancing multimodal retrieval in
more realistic and challenging scenarios.

Abstract: Document expansion (DE) via query generation tackles vocabulary mismatch in
sparse retrieval, yet faces limitations: uncontrolled generation producing
hallucinated or redundant queries with low diversity; poor generalization from
in-domain training (e.g., MS MARCO) to out-of-domain data like BEIR; and noise
from concatenation harming dense retrieval. While Large Language Models (LLMs)
enable cross-domain query generation, basic prompting lacks control, and
taxonomy-based methods rely on domain-specific structures, limiting
applicability. To address these challenges, we introduce Doc2Query++, a DE
framework that structures query generation by first inferring a document's
latent topics via unsupervised topic modeling for cross-domain applicability,
then using hybrid keyword selection to create a diverse and relevant keyword
set per document. This guides LLM not only to leverage keywords, which ensure
comprehensive topic representation, but also to reduce redundancy through
diverse, relevant terms. To prevent noise from query appending in dense
retrieval, we propose Dual-Index Fusion strategy that isolates text and query
signals, boosting performance in dense settings. Extensive experiments show
Doc2Query++ significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving
substantial gains in MAP, nDCG@10 and Recall@100 across diverse datasets on
both sparse and dense retrieval.

Abstract: This paper introduces a modular and scalable design optimization framework
for the wing design process that enables faster early-phase design while
ensuring aerodynamic stability. The pipeline starts with the generation of
initial wing geometries and then proceeds to optimize the wing using several
algorithms. Aerodynamic performance is assessed using a Vortex Lattice Method
(VLM) applied to a carefully selected dataset of wing configurations. These
results are employed to develop surrogate neural network models, which can
predict lift and drag rapidly and accurately. The stability evaluation is
implemented by setting the control surfaces and components to fixed positions
in order to have realistic flight dynamics. The approach unifies and compares
several optimization techniques, including Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO),
Genetic Algorithms (GA), gradient-based MultiStart methods, Bayesian
optimization, and Lipschitz optimization. Each method ensures constraint
management via adaptive strategies and penalty functions, where the targets for
lift and design feasibility are enforced. The progression of aerodynamic
characteristics and geometries over the optimization iterations will be
investigated in order to clarify each algorithm's convergence characteristics
and performance efficiency. Our results show improvement in aerodynamic
qualities and robust stability properties, offering a mechanism for wing design
at speed and precision. In the interest of reproducibility and community
development, the complete implementation is publicly available at
https://github.com/AmirHosseinGhaemi2000/CHIMERA.

Conclusion: 将进化计算重新定义为自然生成AI，强调结构化破坏和选择压力调节作为创造力的关键驱动力，在生成AI时代对推进探索性设计、创新和开放生成具有重要作用。

Abstract: Generative AI (GenAI) has achieved remarkable success across a range of
domains, but its capabilities remain constrained to statistical models of
finite training sets and learning based on local gradient signals. This often
results in artifacts that are more derivative than genuinely generative. In
contrast, Evolutionary Computation (EC) offers a search-driven pathway to
greater diversity and creativity, expanding generative capabilities by
exploring uncharted solution spaces beyond the limits of available data. This
work establishes a fundamental connection between EC and GenAI, redefining EC
as Natural Generative AI (NatGenAI) -- a generative paradigm governed by
exploratory search under natural selection. We demonstrate that classical EC
with parent-centric operators mirrors conventional GenAI, while disruptive
operators enable structured evolutionary leaps, often within just a few
generations, to generate out-of-distribution artifacts. Moreover, the methods
of evolutionary multitasking provide an unparalleled means of integrating
disruptive EC (with cross-domain recombination of evolved features) and
moderated selection mechanisms (allowing novel solutions to survive), thereby
fostering sustained innovation. By reframing EC as NatGenAI, we emphasize
structured disruption and selection pressure moderation as essential drivers of
creativity. This perspective extends the generative paradigm beyond
conventional boundaries and positions EC as crucial to advancing exploratory
design, innovation, scientific discovery, and open-ended generation in the
GenAI era.

### [400] [The Enduring Dominance of Deep Neural Networks: A Critical Analysis of the Fundamental Limitations of Quantum Machine Learning and Spiking Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08591)
*Takehiro Ishikawa*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: 量子机器学习和脉冲神经网络不太可能在短期内取代深度神经网络，因为QML面临量子硬件限制和训练挑战，SNN存在表示能力限制和效率问题，而DNN通过高效的反向传播和优化技术保持主导地位。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分析量子机器学习和脉冲神经网络作为深度神经网络替代方案的可行性，评估它们在实际应用中的局限性和挑战。

Method: 通过对比分析QML、SNN和DNN在理论基础、硬件限制、训练效率、表示能力和实际性能等方面的差异。

Result: QML受到量子硬件限制、训练困难和泛化问题困扰；SNN面临表示带宽限制和效率挑战；DNN通过反向传播、正则化和硬件优化保持优势。

Conclusion: 虽然QML和SNN可能在特定领域发挥作用，但DNN仍然是当前AI发展的主导范式，具有更好的实用性和可扩展性。

Abstract: Recent advancements in QML and SNNs have generated considerable excitement,
promising exponential speedups and brain-like energy efficiency to
revolutionize AI. However, this paper argues that they are unlikely to displace
DNNs in the near term. QML struggles with adapting backpropagation due to
unitary constraints, measurement-induced state collapse, barren plateaus, and
high measurement overheads, exacerbated by the limitations of current noisy
intermediate-scale quantum hardware, overfitting risks due to underdeveloped
regularization techniques, and a fundamental misalignment with machine
learning's generalization. SNNs face restricted representational bandwidth,
struggling with long-range dependencies and semantic encoding in language tasks
due to their discrete, spike-based processing. Furthermore, the goal of
faithfully emulating the brain might impose inherent inefficiencies like
cognitive biases, limited working memory, and slow learning speeds. Even their
touted energy-efficient advantages are overstated; optimized DNNs with
quantization can outperform SNNs in energy costs under realistic conditions.
Finally, SNN training incurs high computational overhead from temporal
unfolding. In contrast, DNNs leverage efficient backpropagation, robust
regularization, and innovations in LRMs that shift scaling to inference-time
compute, enabling self-improvement via RL and search algorithms like MCTS while
mitigating data scarcity. This superiority is evidenced by recent models such
as xAI's Grok-4 Heavy, which advances SOTA performance, and gpt-oss-120b, which
surpasses or approaches the performance of leading industry models despite its
modest 120-billion-parameter size deployable on a single 80GB GPU. Furthermore,
specialized ASICs amplify these efficiency gains. Ultimately, QML and SNNs may
serve niche hybrid roles, but DNNs remain the dominant, practical paradigm for
AI advancement.

### [401] [A Denoising Diffusion-Based Evolutionary Algorithm Framework: Application to the Maximum Independent Set Problem](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08627)
*Joan Salvà Soler,Günther R. Raidl*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合去噪扩散模型和进化算法的混合框架DDEA，在组合优化问题上显著优于现有方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 去噪扩散模型在组合优化中缺乏传统元启发式算法（如进化算法）的鲁棒探索能力，需要结合两者的优势

Method: 使用预训练DDM进行高质量多样化种群初始化，并开发基于扩散的重组算子，通过模仿学习训练

Result: 在最大独立集问题上，DDEA在相同时间预算下优于DIFUSCO，在更大图上超越Gurobi，在分布外实验中质量比DIFUSCO高11.6%

Conclusion: DDM与EA的混合方法具有巨大潜力，为复杂组合优化问题提供了有前景的机器学习求解器发展方向

Abstract: Denoising diffusion models (DDMs) offer a promising generative approach for
combinatorial optimization, yet they often lack the robust exploration
capabilities of traditional metaheuristics like evolutionary algorithms (EAs).
We propose a Denoising Diffusion-based Evolutionary Algorithm (DDEA) framework
that synergistically integrates these paradigms. It utilizes pre-trained DDMs
for both high-quality and diverse population initialization and a novel
diffusion-based recombination operator, trained via imitation learning against
an optimal demonstrator. Evaluating DDEA on the Maximum Independent Set problem
on Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graphs, we demonstrate notable improvements over DIFUSCO,
a leading DDM solver. DDEA consistently outperforms it given the same time
budget, and surpasses Gurobi on larger graphs under the same time limit, with
DDEA's solution sizes being 3.9% and 7.5% larger on the ER-300-400 and
ER-700-800 datasets, respectively. In out-of-distribution experiments, DDEA
provides solutions of 11.6% higher quality than DIFUSCO under the same time
limit. Ablation studies confirm that both diffusion initialization and
recombination are crucial. Our work highlights the potential of hybridizing
DDMs and EAs, offering a promising direction for the development of powerful
machine learning solvers for complex combinatorial optimization problems.

*Isaac Robledo,Yiqing Li,Guy Y. Cornejo Maceda,Rodrigo Castellanos*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: HyGO是一个混合遗传优化框架，结合了进化算法的全局探索能力和加速局部搜索，用于解决参数和函数优化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决进化算法收敛速度慢的问题，特别是在后期学习阶段，需要高效统一的优化框架来支持复杂工程问题中的参数和函数学习。

Method: 采用两阶段策略平衡探索和利用：对于参数问题，交替使用遗传算法和降噪下山单纯形法；对于函数优化，在遗传规划和DSM之间轮换。

Result: 在参数优化基准测试中比标准遗传算法收敛更快更稳健；在函数优化任务中成功控制阻尼Landau振荡器；在Ahmed车身气动减阻应用中实现超过20%的减阻效果。

Conclusion: HyGO是一个适用于广泛工程和科学问题的多功能混合优化框架，能够有效处理参数和函数学习任务。

Abstract: The Hybrid Genetic Optimisation framework (HyGO) is introduced to meet the
pressing need for efficient and unified optimisation frameworks that support
both parametric and functional learning in complex engineering problems.
Evolutionary algorithms are widely employed as derivative-free global
optimisation methods but often suffer from slow convergence rates, especially
during late-stage learning. HyGO integrates the global exploration capabilities
of evolutionary algorithms with accelerated local search for robust solution
refinement. The key enabler is a two-stage strategy that balances exploration
and exploitation. For parametric problems, HyGO alternates between a genetic
algorithm and targeted improvement through a degradation-proof Dowhill Simplex
Method (DSM). For function optimisation tasks, HyGO rotates between genetic
programming and DSM. Validation is performed on (a) parametric optimisation
benchmarks, where HyGO demonstrates faster and more robust convergence than
standard genetic algorithms, and (b) function optimisation tasks, including
control of a damped Landau oscillator. Practical relevance is showcased through
aerodynamic drag reduction of an Ahmed body via Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes
simulations, achieving consistently interpretable results and reductions
exceeding 20% by controlled jet injection in the back of the body for flow
reattachment and separation bubble reduction. Overall, HyGO emerges as a
versatile hybrid optimisation framework suitable for a broad spectrum of
engineering and scientific problems involving parametric and functional
learning.
