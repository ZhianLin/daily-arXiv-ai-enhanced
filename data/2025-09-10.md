### [1] [Detection and Recovery of Adversarial Slow-Pose Drift in Offloaded Visual-Inertial Odometry](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07130)
*Soruya Saha,Md Nurul Absur,Saptarshi Debroy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 针对边缘服务器端VIO系统的姿态欺骗攻击，提出了一种无监督、无需标签的检测与恢复机制，通过学习攻击自由会话中的运动时序规律来检测运行时偏差并恢复姿态一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前将VIO卸载到边缘服务器的趋势导致服务器端存在威胁面，细微的姿态欺骗可能累积成显著漂移，同时逃避启发式检查。

Method: 在攻击自由会话上训练模型学习运动时序规律，检测运行时偏差并启动恢复机制来恢复姿态一致性。

Result: 在ILLIXR测试平台上使用多种欺骗强度进行评估，实验结果显示在轨迹和姿态误差方面相比无防御基线有显著降低。

Conclusion: 提出的无监督检测恢复机制能有效防御VIO系统中的姿态欺骗攻击，显著改善系统安全性和准确性。

Abstract: Visual-Inertial Odometry (VIO) supports immersive Virtual Reality (VR) by
fusing camera and Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) data for real-time pose.
However, current trend of offloading VIO to edge servers can lead server-side
threat surface where subtle pose spoofing can accumulate into substantial
drift, while evading heuristic checks. In this paper, we study this threat and
present an unsupervised, label-free detection and recovery mechanism. The
proposed model is trained on attack-free sessions to learn temporal
regularities of motion to detect runtime deviations and initiate recovery to
restore pose consistency. We evaluate the approach in a realistic offloaded-VIO
environment using ILLIXR testbed across multiple spoofing intensities.
Experimental results in terms of well-known performance metrics show
substantial reductions in trajectory and pose error compared to a no-defense
baseline.

### [2] [CellPainTR: Generalizable Representation Learning for Cross-Dataset Cell Painting Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06986)
*Cedric Caruzzo,Jong Chul Ye*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CellPainTR是一个基于Transformer的架构，用于学习对批次效应稳健的细胞形态学基础表征，能够在无需微调的情况下有效泛化到未见数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模生物发现需要整合海量异构数据集，但技术批次效应和缺乏可泛化模型是关键障碍。

Method: 采用Transformer架构，设计源特定上下文标记，实现无需重新训练的有效分布外泛化。

Result: 在JUMP数据集上优于ComBat和Harmony等现有方法，在未见Bray数据集上保持高性能。

Conclusion: 这项工作代表了创建真正基于图像分析的基础模型的重要一步，实现了更可靠和可扩展的跨研究生物分析。

Abstract: Large-scale biological discovery requires integrating massive, heterogeneous
datasets like those from the JUMP Cell Painting consortium, but technical batch
effects and a lack of generalizable models remain critical roadblocks. To
address this, we introduce CellPainTR, a Transformer-based architecture
designed to learn foundational representations of cellular morphology that are
robust to batch effects. Unlike traditional methods that require retraining on
new data, CellPainTR's design, featuring source-specific context tokens, allows
for effective out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization to entirely unseen
datasets without fine-tuning. We validate CellPainTR on the large-scale JUMP
dataset, where it outperforms established methods like ComBat and Harmony in
both batch integration and biological signal preservation. Critically, we
demonstrate its robustness through a challenging OOD task on the unseen Bray et
al. dataset, where it maintains high performance despite significant domain and
feature shifts. Our work represents a significant step towards creating truly
foundational models for image-based profiling, enabling more reliable and
scalable cross-study biological analysis.

### [3] [FusWay: Multimodal hybrid fusion approach. Application to Railway Defect Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06987)
*Alexey Zhukov,Jenny Benois-Pineau,Amira Youssef,Akka Zemmari,Mohamed Mosbah,Virginie Taillandier*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种基于YOLOv8n和Vision Transformer的多模态融合架构，通过结合视觉和音频信息来提高路轨缺陷检测的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单一视觉模态在路轨缺陷检测中存在过检测问题，当正常结构元件外观类似缺陷时容易出现误检。音频信息虽然语义信息不高，但可以提供补充信息来提高检测准确性。

Method: 构建基于领域规则的多模态融合架构，使用YOLOv8n进行快速物体检测，结合Vision Transformer统合多层特征图（第7、16、19层）和音频表征，重点关注路轨断裂和表面缺陷两类缺陷。

Result: 在真实路轨数据集上的实验评估显示，多模态融合方法比单一视觉方法提高了准确率和总体准确性0.2个百分点。Student's unpaired t-test证实了均值准确性存在统计显著性差异。

Conclusion: 多模态融合技术能够有效提高路轨缺陷检测的性能，通过结合视觉和音频信息可以减少过检测问题，为工业检测应用提供更准确的解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal fusion is a multimedia technique that has become popular in the
wide range of tasks where image information is accompanied by a signal/audio.
The latter may not convey highly semantic information, such as speech or music,
but some measures such as audio signal recorded by mics in the goal to detect
rail structure elements or defects. While classical detection approaches such
as You Only Look Once (YOLO) family detectors can be efficiently deployed for
defect detection on the image modality, the single modality approaches remain
limited. They yield an overdetection in case of the appearance similar to
normal structural elements. The paper proposes a new multimodal fusion
architecture built on the basis of domain rules with YOLO and Vision
transformer backbones. It integrates YOLOv8n for rapid object detection with a
Vision Transformer (ViT) to combine feature maps extracted from multiple layers
(7, 16, and 19) and synthesised audio representations for two defect classes:
rail Rupture and Surface defect. Fusion is performed between audio and image.
Experimental evaluation on a real-world railway dataset demonstrates that our
multimodal fusion improves precision and overall accuracy by 0.2 points
compared to the vision-only approach. Student's unpaired t-test also confirms
statistical significance of differences in the mean accuracy.

### [4] [Frustratingly Easy Feature Reconstruction for Out-of-Distribution Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06988)
*Yingsheng Wang,Shuo Lu,Jian Liang,Aihua Zheng,Ran He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需训练数据的后处理OOD检测方法ClaFR，通过分类器权重的正交分解提取类已知子空间，计算特征重构误差来实现OOD检测，在多个基准测试中达到领先性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于特征的后处理方法通常需要访问训练数据，这在数据隐私保护场景下不适用。为了解决这个问题，需要开发一种不需要训练数据的OOD检测方法。

Method: ClaFR方法：1）对分类器权重进行正交分解提取类已知子空间；2）将原始数据特征映射到该子空间获得新表示；3）计算子空间内的特征重构误差作为OOD分数。

Result: 该方法在多个OOD基准测试中取得了领先性能，且不需要访问训练数据。

Conclusion: ClaFR是一种简单有效的后处理OOD检测方法，通过子空间投影视角解决了数据隐私场景下的OOD检测问题，性能优越且无需训练数据。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection helps models identify data outside the
training categories, crucial for security applications. While feature-based
post-hoc methods address this by evaluating data differences in the feature
space without changing network parameters, they often require access to
training data, which may not be suitable for some data privacy scenarios. This
may not be suitable in scenarios where data privacy protection is a concern. In
this paper, we propose a simple yet effective post-hoc method, termed
Classifier-based Feature Reconstruction (ClaFR), from the perspective of
subspace projection. It first performs an orthogonal decomposition of the
classifier's weights to extract the class-known subspace, then maps the
original data features into this subspace to obtain new data representations.
Subsequently, the OOD score is determined by calculating the feature
reconstruction error of the data within the subspace. Compared to existing OOD
detection algorithms, our method does not require access to training data while
achieving leading performance on multiple OOD benchmarks. Our code is released
at https://github.com/Aie0923/ClaFR.

### [5] [DIET-CP: Lightweight and Data Efficient Self Supervised Continued Pretraining](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06990)
*Bryan Rodas,Natalie Montesino,Jakob Ambsdorf,David Klindt,Randall Balestriero*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DIET-CP是一种简单的持续预训练策略，可以在小规模专业领域数据集上有效调整基础模型，无需标签和额外超参数，仅用1000张图像就能显著提升DINOv3等先进模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决专业领域中数据集规模小、SSL方法不适用、超参数搜索不可行，以及预训练模型缺乏重要信息的问题。

Method: 使用简单的目标函数，无需标签，不引入比监督微调更多的超参数，通过持续预训练将基础模型引导到新的数据分布。

Result: 在不同数据模态和骨干网络选择中表现稳定，仅用1000张图像就能显著提升DINOv3等先进模型的性能。

Conclusion: DIET-CP提供了一种简单有效的解决方案，填补了专业领域小数据集持续预训练的空白，具有很好的通用性和稳定性。

Abstract: Continued pretraining offers a promising solution for adapting foundation
models to a new target domain. However, in specialized domains, available
datasets are often very small, limiting the applicability of SSL methods
developed for large-scale pretraining and making hyperparameter search
infeasible. In addition, pretrained models are usually released as
backbone-weights only, lacking important information to continue pretraining.
We propose to bridge this gap with DIET-CP, a simple continued pretraining
strategy, where any strong foundation model can be steered towards the new data
distribution of interest. DIET-CP relies on a very simple objective, requires
no labels, and introduces no more hyperparameters than supervised finetuning.
It is stable across data modalities and backbone choices, while providing a
significant performance boost for state-of-the-art models such as DINOv3 using
only 1000 images.

### [6] [FedAPT: Federated Adversarial Prompt Tuning for Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06992)
*Kun Zhai,Siheng Chen,Xingjun Ma,Yu-Gang Jiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FedAPT是一种增强联邦提示调优对抗鲁棒性的新方法，通过类别感知提示生成器和跨层生成器共享策略解决非IID设置下的类别信息差距问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦提示调优(FPT)方法训练的模型容易受到对抗攻击，导致下游任务错误分类，特别是在非独立同分布(non-IID)设置下存在类别信息差距问题

Method: 提出类别感知提示生成器，利用全局标签嵌入作为信标生成全局对齐的视觉提示；采用跨层生成器共享策略增强不同层间的提示耦合

Result: 在多个图像分类数据集上的实验表明，FedAPT在提升对抗鲁棒性方面显著优于现有方法，并在跨域和跨数据集场景中表现出优异的泛化能力

Conclusion: FedAPT有效解决了联邦提示调优中的对抗鲁棒性问题，具有实际应用价值

Abstract: Federated Prompt Tuning (FPT) is an efficient method for cross-client
collaborative fine-tuning of large Vision-Language Models (VLMs). However,
models tuned using FPT are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, leading to
misclassification in downstream tasks. In this work, we introduce Federated
Adversarial Prompt Tuning (\textbf{FedAPT}), a novel method designed to enhance
the adversarial robustness of FPT. We identify a key issue in FedAPT under
non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) settings: a \textit{class
information gap} between clients and the global model. Clients rely solely on
limited local label information to generate adversarial samples for training,
while the global model must defend against adversarial attacks from global
labels. To address this issue, we propose a \textbf{class-aware prompt
generator} that generates visual prompts from text prompts. This generator is
guided by a \emph{Global Label Embedding} (serving as a ``beacon") which
encodes cross-client label information to create more globally-aligned visual
prompts. Additionally, we propose a \textbf{cross-layer generator sharing}
strategy to enhance prompt coupling across different layers of the model,
further boosting adversarial robustness. Extensive experiments on multiple
image classification datasets demonstrate the superiority of FedAPT in
improving adversarial robustness, outperforming existing methods by a large
margin. FedAPT also exhibits exceptional generalization in cross-domain and
cross-dataset scenarios, indicating its effectiveness in real-world
applications.

### [8] [VLMs-in-the-Wild: Bridging the Gap Between Academic Benchmarks and Enterprise Reality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06994)
*Srihari Bandraupalli,Anupam Purwar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ViLD框架填补了学术评估与企业部署需求之间的差距，通过10个关键业务任务和创新的BlockWeaver算法，在真实企业数据上评估开源视觉语言模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于选择题和合成数据的基准测试无法反映真实企业应用的复杂性，需要建立更贴近实际部署需求的评估框架。

Method: 提出ViLD框架，定义10个企业关键任务，开发BlockWeaver算法处理无序OCR输出比较，构建包含7500个真实样本的基准数据集，结合语义匹配、传统指标和新颖方法进行综合评估。

Result: 在领先的开源VLM（Qwen、MIMO、InternVL）与专有基线的对比评估中，提供了首个基于行业实际任务的VLM能力评估，为企业部署提供实用见解。

Conclusion: ViLD框架成功弥合了学术研究与企业需求之间的鸿沟，为开源视觉语言模型在企业环境中的实际部署提供了可靠的评估标准和实用指导。

Abstract: Open-source Vision-Language Models show immense promise for enterprise
applications, yet a critical disconnect exists between academic evaluation and
enterprise deployment requirements. Current benchmarks rely heavily on
multiple-choice questions and synthetic data, failing to capture the complexity
of real-world business applications like social media content analysis. This
paper introduces VLM-in-the-Wild (ViLD), a comprehensive framework to bridge
this gap by evaluating VLMs on operational enterprise requirements. We define
ten business-critical tasks: logo detection, OCR, object detection, human
presence and demographic analysis, human activity and appearance analysis,
scene detection, camera perspective and media quality assessment, dominant
colors, comprehensive description, and NSFW detection. To this framework, we
bring an innovative BlockWeaver Algorithm that solves the challenging problem
of comparing unordered, variably-grouped OCR outputs from VLMs without relying
on embeddings or LLMs, achieving remarkable speed and reliability. To
demonstrate efficacy of ViLD, we constructed a new benchmark dataset of 7,500
diverse samples, carefully stratified from a corpus of one million real-world
images and videos. ViLD provides actionable insights by combining semantic
matching (both embedding-based and LLM-as-a-judge approaches), traditional
metrics, and novel methods to measure the completeness and faithfulness of
descriptive outputs. By benchmarking leading open-source VLMs (Qwen, MIMO, and
InternVL) against a powerful proprietary baseline as per ViLD framework, we
provide one of the first industry-grounded, task-driven assessment of VLMs
capabilities, offering actionable insights for their deployment in enterprise
environments.

### [9] [The Protocol Genome A Self Supervised Learning Framework from DICOM Headers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06995)
*Jimmy Joseph*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Protocol Genome是一个自监督学习系统，通过分析DICOM头文件学习协议相关性，在外部验证中达到AUROC 0.901（基准0.847）和ECE 0.036（基准0.058），提高了跨模态和供应商的校准性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床影像通过PACS/DICOM系统处理，扫描协议选择（扫描仪型号、序列、参数等）会影响对比度、噪声和伪影，这些潜在混杂因素阻碍了仅基于图像的跨站点泛化。

Method: 将结构化DICOM头文件作为标签，通过三种方式学习协议感知但临床鲁棒的图像表示：(1)协议-图像对比学习，(2)掩码协议预测，(3)协议-协议转换。使用126万项研究数据进行实验。

Result: 在三个临床任务上表现优异：肺栓塞CT分诊（+0.046 AUROC）、脑胶质瘤MRI分级（+0.058 AUROC）、心胸比X光检测（+0.041 AUROC），校准性提升25-37%，且在10-20%标注数据下仍保持优势。

Conclusion: Protocol Genome能减少协议边界处的假阳性，适用于PACS系统，提供了模型卡片和部署指南，包括去标识化和偏倚审计。该方法虽然任务依赖性较强，但在临床应用中具有重要价值。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the Protocol Genome, a self-supervised learning
system that learns correlations from DICOM headers and achieves AUROC 0.901 (vs
0.847 baseline) and ECE 0.036 (vs 0.058) on fully held-out external validation.
Our method also improves calibration and robustness across modalities (CT, MRI,
CXR) and vendors. Clinical imaging is funneled through PACS/DICOM, where
procedure choices (scanner make/model, sequence, kernel, kVp, TR/TE, and slice
thickness) have consequences for contrast, noise, and artifact. These latent
confounders impede the generalization of image-only networks across sites. We
consider structured DICOM headers as a label and learn protocol-aware but
clinically robust image representations. Protocol Genome obtains tokenized
embeddings of de-identified header fields and models them along with image
features using: (1) protocol-image contrastive learning, (2) masked protocol
prediction, and (3) protocol-protocol translation. With 1.26M studies (7 health
systems, 31 scanners, 3 vendors; CT, MR, CR/DR), we experiment on: (A) chest CT
triage for PE, (B) brain MRI glioma grading, and (C) chest radiograph
cardiomegaly detection. Relative to strong SSL baselines (SimCLR, MAE) as well
as ImageNet transfer, Protocol Genome (+0.046: PE, +0.058: glioma, +0.041:
cardiomegaly) is associated with higher external AUROC; 25-37% calibration
improvements are obtained (p < 0.01, DeLong tests). While the gains may be
task-dependent, they are preserved with 10-20% of labeled data. From a clinical
point of view, the technique reduces false positives at protocol borders and is
applicable in a PACS (DICOM C-FIND/C-MOVE, DICOMweb QIDO/WADO). We publish a
model card and deployment guide, complete with both de-identification and bias
audits.

*Jie Zhang,Ting Xu,Gelei Deng,Runyi Hu,Han Qiu,Tianwei Zhang,Qing Guo,Ivor Tsang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究发现先进视觉语言模型在字符破碎、融合或部分遮挡时识别能力严重下降，与人类强大的文字识别韧性形成鲜明对比，揭示了模型在符号组合和结构理解方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究先进视觉语言模型是否具备人类那样的文字识别韧性，即在字符破碎、融合或部分遮挡时仍能准确识别文字的能力。

Method: 构建两个心理物理学启发的基准测试，分别针对中文表意文字和英文拼音文字，通过切割、重组和叠加字形来创建对模型"可见但不可读"但对人类仍可读的刺激材料。

Result: 尽管在清晰文本上表现强劲，但当代视觉语言模型在这些扰动下表现严重下降，经常产生不相关或不连贯的输出，表明模型过度依赖通用视觉不变性而忽视了组合先验。

Conclusion: 研究结果呼吁开发能够编码符号分割、组合和跨文字绑定的架构和训练策略，为教育、无障碍、文化遗产和安全等领域的多模态系统部署指明了具体挑战。

Abstract: Writing is a universal cultural technology that reuses vision for symbolic
communication. Humans display striking resilience: we readily recognize words
even when characters are fragmented, fused, or partially occluded. This paper
investigates whether advanced vision language models (VLMs) share this
resilience. We construct two psychophysics inspired benchmarks across distinct
writing systems, Chinese logographs and English alphabetic words, by splicing,
recombining, and overlaying glyphs to yield ''visible but unreadable'' stimuli
for models while remaining legible to humans. Despite strong performance on
clean text, contemporary VLMs show a severe drop under these perturbations,
frequently producing unrelated or incoherent outputs. The pattern suggests a
structural limitation: models heavily leverage generic visual invariances but
under rely on compositional priors needed for robust literacy. We release
stimuli generation code, prompts, and evaluation protocols to facilitate
transparent replication and follow up work. Our findings motivate architectures
and training strategies that encode symbol segmentation, composition, and
binding across scripts, and they delineate concrete challenges for deploying
multimodal systems in education, accessibility, cultural heritage, and
security.

*Guan Yu,Zhang Jianhua,Liang Dong,Liu Qiegen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种在频域进行特征级学习的方法，通过时间融合策略合成k空间数据，用于动态心脏MRI重建，在低数据条件下表现出强大的生成能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于心脏磁共振成像的动态性和复杂性，高质量且多样化的k空间数据在实践中很少可用，这阻碍了动态心脏MRI的鲁棒重建。

Method: 在频域进行特征级学习，利用傅里叶变换的全局表示能力，将频域视为自然全局特征空间。采用时间融合策略整合不同时间帧的k空间数据，优化生成轨迹。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在低数据条件下具有强大的生成能力，能够有效缓解动态MRI重建中的数据稀缺问题。

Conclusion: 频域特征级建模结合时间融合策略为动态心脏MRI重建提供了一种实用的解决方案，特别是在数据稀缺的情况下表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Owing to the inherently dynamic and complex characteristics of cardiac
magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging, high-quality and diverse k-space data are
rarely available in practice, which in turn hampers robust reconstruction of
dynamic cardiac MRI. To address this challenge, we perform feature-level
learning directly in the frequency domain and employ a temporal-fusion strategy
as the generative guidance to synthesize k-space data. Specifically, leveraging
the global representation capacity of the Fourier transform, the frequency
domain can be considered a natural global feature space. Therefore, unlike
traditional methods that use pixel-level convolution for feature learning and
modeling in the image domain, this letter focuses on feature-level modeling in
the frequency domain, enabling stable and rich generation even with ultra
low-data regimes. Moreover, leveraging the advantages of feature-level modeling
in the frequency domain, we integrate k-space data across time frames with
multiple fusion strategies to steer and further optimize the generative
trajectory. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method possesses
strong generative ability in low-data regimes, indicating practical potential
to alleviate data scarcity in dynamic MRI reconstruction.

*Liviu Nicolae Fircă,Antonio Bărbălau,Dan Oneata,Elena Burceanu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文评估了模型在语义和感知差异大的类别间进行属性知识泛化的能力，发现当训练和测试类别相关性降低时性能急剧下降，表明当前模型对分割策略高度敏感。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要在狭窄的分类学或视觉相似领域内处理属性预测，但模型是否能在概念上相距较远的类别间抽象和应用属性仍不清楚。

Method: 引入基于LLM语义分组、嵌入相似度阈值、嵌入聚类和超类别分割的训练-测试分割策略，逐步减少训练集和测试集之间的相关性。

Result: 随着训练和测试类别相关性降低，模型性能急剧下降。聚类方法在减少隐藏相关性和保持可学习性之间提供了最佳权衡。

Conclusion: 当前表示方法在跨类别属性推理方面存在局限性，这些发现为未来属性推理基准构建提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Can models generalize attribute knowledge across semantically and
perceptually dissimilar categories? While prior work has addressed attribute
prediction within narrow taxonomic or visually similar domains, it remains
unclear whether current models can abstract attributes and apply them to
conceptually distant categories. This work presents the first explicit
evaluation for the robustness of the attribute prediction task under such
conditions, testing whether models can correctly infer shared attributes
between unrelated object types: e.g., identifying that the attribute "has four
legs" is common to both "dogs" and "chairs". To enable this evaluation, we
introduce train-test split strategies that progressively reduce correlation
between training and test sets, based on: LLM-driven semantic grouping,
embedding similarity thresholding, embedding-based clustering, and
supercategory-based partitioning using ground-truth labels. Results show a
sharp drop in performance as the correlation between training and test
categories decreases, indicating strong sensitivity to split design. Among the
evaluated methods, clustering yields the most effective trade-off, reducing
hidden correlations while preserving learnability. These findings offer new
insights into the limitations of current representations and inform future
benchmark construction for attribute reasoning.

*Ahmed R. Sadik,Mariusz Bujny*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种人机交互框架，用于定量评估LLM生成的3D模型，通过多模态输入比较生成质量，发现代码级提示能实现完美重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏评估LLM生成3D模型几何和结构保真度的稳健方法，需要开发定量评估框架来支持CAD设计民主化、逆向工程和快速原型等应用。

Method: 提出了一套全面的相似性和复杂性度量标准（体积精度、表面对齐、尺寸保真度、拓扑复杂性），使用L型支架作为案例研究，比较四种输入模态（2D正交视图、等距草图、几何结构树、代码修正提示）的性能。

Result: 研究发现语义丰富度越高生成保真度越好，代码级提示在所有度量标准上都实现了完美重建，定量评估方法相比传统定性方法能显著加快向真实值的收敛。

Conclusion: 这项工作不仅推进了对AI辅助形状合成的理解，还为验证和优化生成模型提供了可扩展的方法论，适用于各种CAD应用。

Abstract: Large Language Models are increasingly capable of interpreting multimodal
inputs to generate complex 3D shapes, yet robust methods to evaluate geometric
and structural fidelity remain underdeveloped. This paper introduces a human in
the loop framework for the quantitative evaluation of LLM generated 3D models,
supporting applications such as democratization of CAD design, reverse
engineering of legacy designs, and rapid prototyping. We propose a
comprehensive suite of similarity and complexity metrics, including volumetric
accuracy, surface alignment, dimensional fidelity, and topological intricacy,
to benchmark generated models against ground truth CAD references. Using an L
bracket component as a case study, we systematically compare LLM performance
across four input modalities: 2D orthographic views, isometric sketches,
geometric structure trees, and code based correction prompts. Our findings
demonstrate improved generation fidelity with increased semantic richness, with
code level prompts achieving perfect reconstruction across all metrics. A key
contribution of this work is demonstrating that our proposed quantitative
evaluation approach enables significantly faster convergence toward the ground
truth, especially compared to traditional qualitative methods based solely on
visual inspection and human intuition. This work not only advances the
understanding of AI assisted shape synthesis but also provides a scalable
methodology to validate and refine generative models for diverse CAD
applications.

Result: 相比现有方法，MEGS²实现了50%的静态显存减少和40%的渲染显存减少，同时保持相当的渲染质量。

Conclusion: MEGS²通过联合优化图元数量和参数数量，有效解决了3DGS的内存瓶颈问题，为边缘设备部署提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a dominant novel-view synthesis
technique, but its high memory consumption severely limits its applicability on
edge devices. A growing number of 3DGS compression methods have been proposed
to make 3DGS more efficient, yet most only focus on storage compression and
fail to address the critical bottleneck of rendering memory. To address this
problem, we introduce MEGS$^{2}$, a novel memory-efficient framework that
tackles this challenge by jointly optimizing two key factors: the total
primitive number and the parameters per primitive, achieving unprecedented
memory compression. Specifically, we replace the memory-intensive spherical
harmonics with lightweight arbitrarily-oriented spherical Gaussian lobes as our
color representations. More importantly, we propose a unified soft pruning
framework that models primitive-number and lobe-number pruning as a single
constrained optimization problem. Experiments show that MEGS$^{2}$ achieves a
50% static VRAM reduction and a 40% rendering VRAM reduction compared to
existing methods, while maintaining comparable rendering quality.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 通过空间域矩和频谱域功率谱的组合正则化损失，促使潜在空间样本符合标准正态分布，以支持文本到图像模型的下游优化任务


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的正态性正则化方法要么只考虑特定阶数的矩，要么在空间域计算协方差涉及高时间复杂度，需要一种统一的框架来提高正态性正则化的效果和效率

Method: 将高维样本元素视为一维标准正态变量，设计组合损失函数：空间域基于矩的正则化和频谱域基于功率谱的正则化。通过随机排列输入确保排列不变性，利用分析知道的矩和功率谱期望值来促进样本符合标准正态特性

Result: 在文本到图像模型的测试时奖励对齐生成任务中，该正则化方法超越了之前的正态性正则化方法，有效防止了奖励驱动的恶意利用（reward hacking），并加速了收敛过程

Conclusion: 该统一框架不仅提供了效果更好的正态性正则化方法，还将现有方法统一为特定矩阶数损失或频谱损失的特例，为文本到图像模型的潜在空间优化提供了有效的工具

Abstract: We propose a novel regularization loss that enforces standard Gaussianity,
encouraging samples to align with a standard Gaussian distribution. This
facilitates a range of downstream tasks involving optimization in the latent
space of text-to-image models. We treat elements of a high-dimensional sample
as one-dimensional standard Gaussian variables and define a composite loss that
combines moment-based regularization in the spatial domain with power
spectrum-based regularization in the spectral domain. Since the expected values
of moments and power spectrum distributions are analytically known, the loss
promotes conformity to these properties. To ensure permutation invariance, the
losses are applied to randomly permuted inputs. Notably, existing
Gaussianity-based regularizations fall within our unified framework: some
correspond to moment losses of specific orders, while the previous
covariance-matching loss is equivalent to our spectral loss but incurs higher
time complexity due to its spatial-domain computation. We showcase the
application of our regularization in generative modeling for test-time reward
alignment with a text-to-image model, specifically to enhance aesthetics and
text alignment. Our regularization outperforms previous Gaussianity
regularization, effectively prevents reward hacking and accelerates
convergence.

Abstract: Image segmentation is a critical task in microscopy, essential for accurately
analyzing and interpreting complex visual data. This task can be performed
using custom models trained on domain-specific datasets, transfer learning from
pre-trained models, or foundational models that offer broad applicability.
However, foundational models often present a considerable number of
non-transparent tuning parameters that require extensive manual optimization,
limiting their usability for real-time streaming data analysis. Here, we
introduce a reward function-based optimization to fine-tune foundational models
and illustrate this approach for SAM (Segment Anything Model) framework by
Meta. The reward functions can be constructed to represent the physics of the
imaged system, including particle size distributions, geometries, and other
criteria. By integrating a reward-driven optimization framework, we enhance
SAM's adaptability and performance, leading to an optimized variant, SAM$^{*}$,
that better aligns with the requirements of diverse segmentation tasks and
particularly allows for real-time streaming data segmentation. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of this approach in microscopy imaging, where precise
segmentation is crucial for analyzing cellular structures, material interfaces,
and nanoscale features.

Abstract: This study tackles the challenge of efficiently classifying streaming data in
envi-ronments with limited memory and computational resources. It delves into
the application of data distillation as an innovative approach to improve the
precision of streaming image data classification. By focusing on distilling
essential features from data streams, our method aims to minimize computational
demands while preserving crucial information for accurate classification. Our
investigation com-pares this approach against traditional algorithms like
Hoeffding Trees and Adap-tive Random Forest, adapted through embeddings for
image data. The Distillation Based Classification (DBC) demonstrated superior
performance, achieving a 73.1% accuracy rate, surpassing both traditional
methods and Reservoir Sam-pling Based Classification (RBC) technique. This
marks a significant advance-ment in streaming data classification, showcasing
the effectiveness of our method in processing complex data streams and setting

*Juan Manuel Contreras*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了Aymara图像公平性评估基准，用于评估AI生成图像中的社会偏见，发现大型多模态模型不仅复制而且放大了职业性别刻板印象，存在显著的默认男性偏见，且不同模型的偏见程度差异很大。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究虽然识别了多模态模型中的性别偏见，但方法学限制阻碍了大规模、可比较的跨模型分析。为了填补这一空白，需要开发标准化的评估工具来系统评估AI生成图像中的社会偏见。

Method: 使用75个程序生成的性别中性提示词，测试13个商业可用的大型多模态模型，生成刻板男性、刻板女性和非刻板职业的人物图像，然后使用经过验证的LLM-as-a-judge系统对965张生成图像进行性别代表性评分。

Result: 研究发现：1）LMMs系统性放大职业性别刻板印象，在男性刻板职业中生成93.0%男性图像，女性刻板职业中仅22.5%男性图像；2）模型存在强烈默认男性偏见，非刻板职业中68.3%生成男性；3）不同模型偏见程度差异显著，男性代表性从46.7%到73.3%不等。

Conclusion: 研究提供了迄今为止最全面的跨模型性别偏见基准，强调高偏见并非不可避免的结果而是设计选择的结果， underscores标准化自动化评估工具对于促进AI开发问责制和公平性的必要性。

Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) have revolutionized text-to-image generation,
but they risk perpetuating the harmful social biases in their training data.
Prior work has identified gender bias in these models, but methodological
limitations prevented large-scale, comparable, cross-model analysis. To address
this gap, we introduce the Aymara Image Fairness Evaluation, a benchmark for
assessing social bias in AI-generated images. We test 13 commercially available
LMMs using 75 procedurally-generated, gender-neutral prompts to generate people
in stereotypically-male, stereotypically-female, and non-stereotypical
professions. We then use a validated LLM-as-a-judge system to score the 965
resulting images for gender representation. Our results reveal (p < .001 for
all): 1) LMMs systematically not only reproduce but actually amplify
occupational gender stereotypes relative to real-world labor data, generating
men in 93.0% of images for male-stereotyped professions but only 22.5% for
female-stereotyped professions; 2) Models exhibit a strong default-male bias,
generating men in 68.3% of the time for non-stereotyped professions; and 3) The
extent of bias varies dramatically across models, with overall male
representation ranging from 46.7% to 73.3%. Notably, the top-performing model
de-amplified gender stereotypes and approached gender parity, achieving the
highest fairness scores. This variation suggests high bias is not an inevitable
outcome but a consequence of design choices. Our work provides the most
comprehensive cross-model benchmark of gender bias to date and underscores the
necessity of standardized, automated evaluation tools for promoting
accountability and fairness in AI development.

TL;DR: 通过使用优化的块稀疏内核替换了Transformer模型中的全局注意力机制，在保持性能的同时实现了4倍的推理速度提升，支持大规模图像集的多视图重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的Transformer基础多视图重建模型如VGGT和π^3存在全局注意力层的二次复杂度问题，导致运行时瓶颈，限制了在大规模图像集上的可扩展性。

Method: 通过对全局注意矩阵的实证分析，发现概率质量聚集在少数对应交叉视图几何匹配的patch交互上，从而提出使用高度优化的块稀疏内核替换密集全局注意操作。

Result: 方案在不需要重新训练背链模型的情况下，实现了较快的推理速度（最高达4倍），同时保持了任务性能的可比性，并支持大规模图像集。

Conclusion: 该方法通过结构化注意力和稀疏化优化，有效解决了Transformer模型在多视图重建中的可扩展性问题，为大规模图像集处理提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Efficient and accurate feed-forward multi-view reconstruction has long been
an important task in computer vision. Recent transformer-based models like VGGT
and $\pi^3$ have achieved impressive results with simple architectures, yet
they face an inherent runtime bottleneck, due to the quadratic complexity of
the global attention layers, that limits the scalability to large image sets.
In this paper, we empirically analyze the global attention matrix of these
models and observe that probability mass concentrates on a small subset of
patch-patch interactions that correspond to cross-view geometric matches.
Motivated by the structured attention and inspired by recent advancement in
large language models, we propose a replacement for the dense global attention
operation based on highly optimized block-sparse kernels, yielding up to
$4\times$ faster inference with comparable task performance. Our retrofit
requires no retraining of the backbone, extends to both VGGT and $\pi^3$, and
supports large image collections. Evaluations on a comprehensive suite of
multi-view benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究假设人脸增强技术在提升感知质量的同时会降低深度伪造检测器的性能，想要系统评估这些技术是否具有反取证作用。

Method: 使用传统图像处理方法和先进的GAN增强技术，在FaceForensics++、DeepFakeDetection和CelebDF-v2数据集上评估对Naïve、空间和频域检测方法的影响，并进行对抗训练实验。

Result: 基础增强滤镜可降低检测准确率，攻击成功率达64.63%；GAN技术进一步利用这些漏洞，攻击成功率达75.12%。

Conclusion: 人脸增强方法可有效作为反取证工具，强调需要更具弹性和适应性的取证方法。

Abstract: Face enhancement techniques are widely used to enhance facial appearance.
However, they can inadvertently distort biometric features, leading to
significant decrease in the accuracy of deepfake detectors. This study
hypothesizes that these techniques, while improving perceptual quality, can
degrade the performance of deepfake detectors. To investigate this, we
systematically evaluate whether commonly used face enhancement methods can
serve an anti-forensic role by reducing detection accuracy. We use both
traditional image processing methods and advanced GAN-based enhancements to
evaluate the robustness of deepfake detectors. We provide a comprehensive
analysis of the effectiveness of these enhancement techniques, focusing on
their impact on Na\"ive, Spatial, and Frequency-based detection methods.
Furthermore, we conduct adversarial training experiments to assess whether
exposure to face enhancement transformations improves model robustness.
Experiments conducted on the FaceForensics++, DeepFakeDetection, and CelebDF-v2
datasets indicate that even basic enhancement filters can significantly reduce
detection accuracy achieving ASR up to 64.63\%. In contrast, GAN-based
techniques further exploit these vulnerabilities, achieving ASR up to 75.12\%.
Our results demonstrate that face enhancement methods can effectively function
as anti-forensic tools, emphasizing the need for more resilient and adaptive
forensic methods.

Motivation: 监督学习需要大量人工标注，而在开放世界情境下可能会出现新类别。虽然之前的研究主要集中在半监督方法，但这篇论文意外地提出了全无监督方法来解决这个问题。

Method: 使用视觉Transformer通过注意力机制生成向量嵌入，然后结合流形学习技术来利用数据的内在几何结构优化嵌入表示，从而提高图像聚类性能。方法能够估计聚类数量，无需预先知道聚类数。

Result: 在CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100、ImageNet-100和Tiny ImageNet数据集上创造了单模态聚类和新类发现的新的最高水平，无论聚类数是否预先知道。

Conclusion: 该全无监督方法能够高效地发现图像数据中的新类别，为开放世界分类问题提供了一种有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Working with annotated data is the cornerstone of supervised learning.
Nevertheless, providing labels to instances is a task that requires significant
human effort. Several critical real-world applications make things more
complicated because no matter how many labels may have been identified in a
task of interest, it could be the case that examples corresponding to novel
classes may appear in the future. Not unsurprisingly, prior work in this,
so-called, `open-world' context has focused a lot on semi-supervised
approaches.
  Focusing on image classification, somehow paradoxically, we propose a fully
unsupervised approach to the problem of determining the novel categories in a
particular dataset. Our approach relies on estimating the number of clusters
using Vision Transformers, which utilize attention mechanisms to generate
vector embeddings. Furthermore, we incorporate manifold learning techniques to
refine these embeddings by exploiting the intrinsic geometry of the data,
thereby enhancing the overall image clustering performance. Overall, we
establish new State-of-the-Art results on single-modal clustering and Novel
Class Discovery on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet-100, and Tiny ImageNet. We do
so, both when the number of clusters is known or unknown ahead of time. The

TL;DR: XBusNet是一种新颖的双提示双分支多模态模型，结合图像特征和临床文本提示，用于精确的乳腺超声分割，在BLU数据集上达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 精确的乳腺超声分割对于可靠测量、定量分析和下游分类至关重要，但对于边缘模糊、对比度低的小病灶仍然困难。文本提示可以增加临床背景，但直接应用弱定位的文本-图像线索往往会产生粗糙的分割结果。

Method: 提出XBusNet双提示双分支多模态模型：全局路径基于CLIP Vision Transformer编码整图语义，局部U-Net路径强调精确边界。提示从结构化元数据自动组装，无需手动点击。使用五折交叉验证在BLU数据集上评估。

Result: XBusNet在BLU数据集上达到平均Dice 0.8765和IoU 0.8149，优于六个强基线。小病灶提升最大，漏检区域和伪激活减少。消融研究显示全局上下文、局部边界建模和提示调制的互补贡献。

Conclusion: 融合全局语义和局部精度的双提示双分支多模态设计能够产生准确的乳腺超声分割掩码，并提高对小而低对比度病灶的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Background: Precise breast ultrasound (BUS) segmentation supports reliable
measurement, quantitative analysis, and downstream classification, yet remains
difficult for small or low-contrast lesions with fuzzy margins and speckle
noise. Text prompts can add clinical context, but directly applying weakly
localized text-image cues (e.g., CAM/CLIP-derived signals) tends to produce
coarse, blob-like responses that smear boundaries unless additional mechanisms
recover fine edges. Methods: We propose XBusNet, a novel dual-prompt,
dual-branch multimodal model that combines image features with clinically
grounded text. A global pathway based on a CLIP Vision Transformer encodes
whole-image semantics conditioned on lesion size and location, while a local
U-Net pathway emphasizes precise boundaries and is modulated by prompts that
describe shape, margin, and Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS)
terms. Prompts are assembled automatically from structured metadata, requiring
no manual clicks. We evaluate on the Breast Lesions USG (BLU) dataset using
five-fold cross-validation. Primary metrics are Dice and Intersection over
Union (IoU); we also conduct size-stratified analyses and ablations to assess
the roles of the global and local paths and the text-driven modulation.
Results: XBusNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on BLU, with mean Dice
of 0.8765 and IoU of 0.8149, outperforming six strong baselines. Small lesions
show the largest gains, with fewer missed regions and fewer spurious
activations. Ablation studies show complementary contributions of global
context, local boundary modeling, and prompt-based modulation. Conclusions: A
dual-prompt, dual-branch multimodal design that merges global semantics with
local precision yields accurate BUS segmentation masks and improves robustness
for small, low-contrast lesions.

Conclusion: 验证了先进生成模型与可解释特征协同作用，可创建高精度医疗诊断工具

Abstract: Data scarcity hinders deep learning for medical imaging. We propose a
framework for breast cancer classification in thermograms that addresses this
using a Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DPM) for data augmentation. Our
DPM-based augmentation is shown to be superior to both traditional methods and
a ProGAN baseline. The framework fuses deep features from a pre-trained
ResNet-50 with handcrafted nonlinear features (e.g., Fractal Dimension) derived
from U-Net segmented tumors. An XGBoost classifier trained on these fused
features achieves 98.0\% accuracy and 98.1\% sensitivity. Ablation studies and
statistical tests confirm that both the DPM augmentation and the nonlinear
feature fusion are critical, statistically significant components of this
success. This work validates the synergy between advanced generative models and
interpretable features for creating highly accurate medical diagnostic tools.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统训练依赖图像-文本对，但标注通常稀疏且缺乏细粒度视觉细节，即使使用数百词描述简单图像也存在不足

Method: RecA利用模型自身的视觉理解嵌入作为条件，通过自监督重建损失优化图像重建，实现理解和生成的对齐

Result: 仅用27 GPU小时，在GenEval(0.73→0.90)和DPGBench(80.93→88.15)上显著提升生成性能，编辑基准也得到改善(ImgEdit 3.38→3.75, GEdit 6.94→7.25)，超越更大开源模型

Conclusion: RecA是一种高效通用的后训练对齐策略，适用于各种UMM架构，能够有效提升多模态模型的生成和编辑能力

Abstract: Unified multimodal models (UMMs) unify visual understanding and generation
within a single architecture. However, conventional training relies on
image-text pairs (or sequences) whose captions are typically sparse and miss
fine-grained visual details--even when they use hundreds of words to describe a
simple image. We introduce Reconstruction Alignment (RecA), a
resource-efficient post-training method that leverages visual understanding
encoder embeddings as dense "text prompts," providing rich supervision without
captions. Concretely, RecA conditions a UMM on its own visual understanding
embeddings and optimizes it to reconstruct the input image with a
self-supervised reconstruction loss, thereby realigning understanding and
generation. Despite its simplicity, RecA is broadly applicable: across
autoregressive, masked-autoregressive, and diffusion-based UMMs, it
consistently improves generation and editing fidelity. With only 27 GPU-hours,
post-training with RecA substantially improves image generation performance on
GenEval (0.73$\rightarrow$0.90) and DPGBench (80.93$\rightarrow$88.15), while
also boosting editing benchmarks (ImgEdit 3.38$\rightarrow$3.75, GEdit
6.94$\rightarrow$7.25). Notably, RecA surpasses much larger open-source models
and applies broadly across diverse UMM architectures, establishing it as an
efficient and general post-training alignment strategy for UMMs

Method: 设计双域增强模块(DDE)包含跨尺度小波Mamba(CSWM)和傅里叶细节恢复块(FDR)来增强低光照图像；设计优先级引导Mamba融合模块(PGMF)通过优先级扫描从局部目标特征开始融合，减少冗余信息影响

Result: 在DroneVehicle和VEDAI数据集上的实验表明，DEPF在目标检测方面表现优异，优于最先进的方法

Conclusion: DEPF方法有效解决了无人机多光谱目标检测的关键挑战，通过双域增强和优先级引导的Mamba融合实现了更好的检测性能

Abstract: Multispectral remote sensing object detection is one of the important
application of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). However, it faces three
challenges. Firstly, the low-light remote sensing images reduce the
complementarity during multi-modality fusion. Secondly, the local small target
modeling is interfered with redundant information in the fusion stage easily.
Thirdly, due to the quadratic computational complexity, it is hard to apply the
transformer-based methods on the UAV platform. To address these limitations,
motivated by Mamba with linear complexity, a UAV multispectral object detector
with dual-domain enhancement and priority-guided mamba fusion (DEPF) is
proposed. Firstly, to enhance low-light remote sensing images, Dual-Domain
Enhancement Module (DDE) is designed, which contains Cross-Scale Wavelet Mamba
(CSWM) and Fourier Details Recovery block (FDR). CSWM applies cross-scale mamba
scanning for the low-frequency components to enhance the global brightness of
images, while FDR constructs spectrum recovery network to enhance the frequency
spectra features for recovering the texture-details. Secondly, to enhance local
target modeling and reduce the impact of redundant information during fusion,
Priority-Guided Mamba Fusion Module (PGMF) is designed. PGMF introduces the
concept of priority scanning, which starts from local targets features
according to the priority scores obtained from modality difference. Experiments
on DroneVehicle dataset and VEDAI dataset reports that, DEPF performs well on
object detection, comparing with state-of-the-art methods. Our code is

Result: 在NTU RGB+D、NTU RGB+D 120和NW-UCLA基准测试上的大量实验表明，G$^{3}$CN有效提升了动作识别性能，特别是在模糊样本上表现突出

Conclusion: G$^{3}$CN通过拓扑图优化和门控机制增强，成功解决了骨架动作识别中的模糊动作区分难题，具有很好的泛化能力

Abstract: Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) have proven to be highly effective for
skeleton-based action recognition, primarily due to their ability to leverage
graph topology for feature aggregation, a key factor in extracting meaningful
representations. However, despite their success, GCNs often struggle to
effectively distinguish between ambiguous actions, revealing limitations in the
representation of learned topological and spatial features. To address this
challenge, we propose a novel approach, Gaussian Topology Refinement Gated
Graph Convolution (G$^{3}$CN), to address the challenge of distinguishing
ambiguous actions in skeleton-based action recognition. G$^{3}$CN incorporates
a Gaussian filter to refine the skeleton topology graph, improving the
representation of ambiguous actions. Additionally, Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs)
are integrated into the GCN framework to enhance information propagation
between skeleton points. Our method shows strong generalization across various
GCN backbones. Extensive experiments on NTU RGB+D, NTU RGB+D 120, and NW-UCLA
benchmarks demonstrate that G$^{3}$CN effectively improves action recognition,
particularly for ambiguous samples.

Motivation: 现有解析图方法主要关注单模态建模，忽略了多模态融合的潜力。语言提供了丰富的空间关系先验，但现有的全局特征融合方法会减弱遮挡区域响应并导致对齐和定位失败

Method: 提出PGVL框架，包含引导模块(GM)。低层节点关注局部特征保持遮挡区域响应，高层节点整合全局特征推断遮挡部分。GM使高语义节点引导低语义节点的特征更新，通过递归双向交叉注意力和净化实现有效融合

Result: 在主流姿态估计数据集上验证了PGVL框架和网络的有效性

Conclusion: PGVL通过创新的引导模块实现了视觉-语言多模态的有效交互，显著提升了遮挡场景下的人体姿态估计性能

Abstract: Parse graphs boost human pose estimation (HPE) by integrating context and
hierarchies, yet prior work mostly focuses on single modality modeling,
ignoring the potential of multimodal fusion. Notably, language offers rich HPE
priors like spatial relations for occluded scenes, but existing visual-language
fusion via global feature integration weakens occluded region responses and
causes alignment and location failures. To address this issue, we propose Parse
Graph-based Visual-Language interaction (PGVL) with a core novel Guided Module
(GM). In PGVL, low-level nodes focus on local features, maximizing the
maintenance of responses in occluded areas and high-level nodes integrate
global features to infer occluded or invisible parts. GM enables high semantic

TL;DR: LGAA是一个轻量级高斯资产适配器框架，通过多视角扩散先验统一建模几何和PBR材质，实现端到端的PBR就绪3D资产生成


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的3D生成方法主要关注几何建模，将纹理烘焙为简单顶点颜色或依赖后处理的图像扩散模型，缺乏端到端的PBR材质生成能力

Method: 采用模块化设计：LGAA Wrapper重用多视角扩散模型层、LGAA Switcher对齐多个扩散先验、LGAA Decoder预测带PBR通道的2D高斯溅射，最后通过后处理提取高质量可重照明网格

Result: 实验证明LGAA在文本和图像条件多视角扩散模型中表现优异，模块化设计支持灵活整合多个扩散先验，仅需6.9万多视角实例即可高效收敛

Conclusion: LGAA提供了一个有效的端到端PBR就绪3D资产生成解决方案，通过知识保留方案实现了数据高效训练和高质量结果

Abstract: The labor- and experience-intensive creation of 3D assets with physically
based rendering (PBR) materials demands an autonomous 3D asset creation
pipeline. However, most existing 3D generation methods focus on geometry
modeling, either baking textures into simple vertex colors or leaving texture
synthesis to post-processing with image diffusion models. To achieve end-to-end
PBR-ready 3D asset generation, we present Lightweight Gaussian Asset Adapter
(LGAA), a novel framework that unifies the modeling of geometry and PBR
materials by exploiting multi-view (MV) diffusion priors from a novel
perspective. The LGAA features a modular design with three components.
Specifically, the LGAA Wrapper reuses and adapts network layers from MV
diffusion models, which encapsulate knowledge acquired from billions of images,
enabling better convergence in a data-efficient manner. To incorporate multiple
diffusion priors for geometry and PBR synthesis, the LGAA Switcher aligns
multiple LGAA Wrapper layers encapsulating different knowledge. Then, a tamed
variational autoencoder (VAE), termed LGAA Decoder, is designed to predict 2D
Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) with PBR channels. Finally, we introduce a dedicated
post-processing procedure to effectively extract high-quality, relightable mesh
assets from the resulting 2DGS. Extensive quantitative and qualitative
experiments demonstrate the superior performance of LGAA with both text-and
image-conditioned MV diffusion models. Additionally, the modular design enables
flexible incorporation of multiple diffusion priors, and the
knowledge-preserving scheme leads to efficient convergence trained on merely
69k multi-view instances. Our code, pre-trained weights, and the dataset used
will be publicly available via our project page:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了EgoGazeVQA基准，利用注视信息提升多模态大模型在自我中心视频问答中的表现，通过注视引导的意图提示方法显著改善了用户意图理解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准忽视了注视作为用户意图指示器的重要作用，自我中心视频通过统一坐标系捕捉用户关注点、动作和上下文，为MLLMs提供了实现主动个性化AI体验的机会。

Method: 构建了基于注视的QA对数据集，由MLLMs生成并经人工标注者精炼；提出了注视引导的意图提示方法，整合空间、时间和意图相关线索；进行了注视相关的微调实验。

Result: 实验显示现有MLLMs难以准确解读用户意图，而注视引导方法显著提升了性能；分析了注视估计准确性对提示效果的影响。

Conclusion: 注视信息对于在自我中心场景中实现更个性化和有效的AI助手具有重要价值，EgoGazeVQA基准填补了现有研究的空白。

Abstract: The emergence of advanced multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has
significantly enhanced AI assistants' ability to process complex information
across modalities. Recently, egocentric videos, by directly capturing user
focus, actions, and context in an unified coordinate, offer an exciting
opportunity to enable proactive and personalized AI user experiences with
MLLMs. However, existing benchmarks overlook the crucial role of gaze as an
indicator of user intent. To address this gap, we introduce EgoGazeVQA, an
egocentric gaze-guided video question answering benchmark that leverages gaze
information to improve the understanding of longer daily-life videos.
EgoGazeVQA consists of gaze-based QA pairs generated by MLLMs and refined by
human annotators. Our experiments reveal that existing MLLMs struggle to
accurately interpret user intentions. In contrast, our gaze-guided intent
prompting methods significantly enhance performance by integrating spatial,
temporal, and intent-related cues. We further conduct experiments on
gaze-related fine-tuning and analyze how gaze estimation accuracy impacts
prompting effectiveness. These results underscore the value of gaze for more
personalized and effective AI assistants in egocentric settings.

Conclusion: GLEAM框架将多模态多视角对齐与可解释性分析相结合，形成了一个全面的跨视角地理定位流程，在提高准确性的同时增强了透明度和可扩展性。

Abstract: Cross-View Geo-Localization (CVGL) focuses on identifying correspondences
between images captured from distinct perspectives of the same geographical
location. However, existing CVGL approaches are typically restricted to a
single view or modality, and their direct visual matching strategy lacks
interpretability: they merely predict whether two images correspond, without
explaining the rationale behind the match. In this paper, we present GLEAM-C, a
foundational CVGL model that unifies multiple views and modalities-including
UAV imagery, street maps, panoramic views, and ground photographs-by aligning
them exclusively with satellite imagery. Our framework enhances training
efficiency through optimized implementation while achieving accuracy comparable
to prior modality-specific CVGL models through a two-phase training strategy.
Moreover, to address the lack of interpretability in traditional CVGL methods,
we leverage the reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models
(MLLMs) to propose a new task, GLEAM-X, which combines cross-view
correspondence prediction with explainable reasoning. To support this task, we
construct a bilingual benchmark using GPT-4o and Doubao-1.5-Thinking-Vision-Pro
to generate training and testing data. The test set is further refined through
detailed human revision, enabling systematic evaluation of explainable
cross-view reasoning and advancing transparency and scalability in
geo-localization. Together, GLEAM-C and GLEAM-X form a comprehensive CVGL
pipeline that integrates multi-modal, multi-view alignment with interpretable
correspondence analysis, unifying accurate cross-view matching with explainable
reasoning and advancing Geo-Localization by enabling models to better Explain
And Match. Code and datasets used in this work will be made publicly accessible

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: XOCT是一个深度学习框架，通过跨维度监督和多尺度特征融合实现从OCT到OCTA的层感知血管重建，显著提升了视网膜血管重建质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统OCTA图像获取困难且成本高，现有深度学习方法忽略视网膜各层血管差异，难以重建诊断所需的精细血管细节。

Method: 提出跨维度监督模块利用分层en-face投影作为监督信号，结合多尺度特征融合模块通过通道重加权策略增强血管描绘。

Result: 在OCTA-500数据集上实验显示XOCT显著改进en-face投影质量，对临床视网膜病理评估具有重要意义。

Conclusion: XOCT有潜力提高OCTA的可及性、可靠性和诊断价值，用于眼科疾病的检测和监测。

Abstract: Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography (OCTA) and its derived en-face
projections provide high-resolution visualization of the retinal and choroidal
vasculature, which is critical for the rapid and accurate diagnosis of retinal
diseases. However, acquiring high-quality OCTA images is challenging due to
motion sensitivity and the high costs associated with software modifications
for conventional OCT devices. Moreover, current deep learning methods for
OCT-to-OCTA translation often overlook the vascular differences across retinal
layers and struggle to reconstruct the intricate, dense vascular details
necessary for reliable diagnosis. To overcome these limitations, we propose
XOCT, a novel deep learning framework that integrates Cross-Dimensional
Supervision (CDS) with a Multi-Scale Feature Fusion (MSFF) network for
layer-aware vascular reconstruction. Our CDS module leverages 2D layer-wise
en-face projections, generated via segmentation-weighted z-axis averaging, as
supervisory signals to compel the network to learn distinct representations for
each retinal layer through fine-grained, targeted guidance. Meanwhile, the MSFF
module enhances vessel delineation through multi-scale feature extraction
combined with a channel reweighting strategy, effectively capturing vascular
details at multiple spatial scales. Our experiments on the OCTA-500 dataset
demonstrate XOCT's improvements, especially for the en-face projections which
are significant for clinical evaluation of retinal pathologies, underscoring
its potential to enhance OCTA accessibility, reliability, and diagnostic value
for ophthalmic disease detection and monitoring. The code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于机器遗忘的偏置缓解方法，通过选择性移除有偏样本或特征表示来减少视觉模型中的各种偏置形式，在多个数据集上显著提高了公平性指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络经常依赖训练数据中的虚假相关性，导致在医疗和自动驾驶等安全关键领域产生有偏或不公平的预测。传统偏置缓解方法需要从头重新训练或重新设计数据管道，而机器遗忘技术提供了一种有前景的事后模型校正替代方案。

Method: 基于隐私保护遗忘技术，评估了多种策略包括梯度上升、LoRA和师生蒸馏方法。在三个基准数据集（CUB-200-2011的姿态偏置、CIFAR-10的合成补丁偏置、CelebA的微笑检测中的性别偏置）上进行实证分析。

Result: 事后遗忘方法显著减少了子群体差异，在CUB-200上人口统计公平性提高了94.86%，CIFAR-10上提高了30.28%，CelebA上提高了97.37%。这些改进以最小的准确率损失实现，在效用、公平性、质量和隐私的联合评估中平均得分为0.62。

Conclusion: 研究结果确立了机器遗忘作为一个实用框架，可以在不需要完全重新训练的情况下增强已部署视觉系统的公平性。

Abstract: Deep neural networks often rely on spurious correlations in training data,
leading to biased or unfair predictions in safety-critical domains such as
medicine and autonomous driving. While conventional bias mitigation typically
requires retraining from scratch or redesigning data pipelines, recent advances
in machine unlearning provide a promising alternative for post-hoc model
correction. In this work, we investigate \textit{Bias-Aware Machine
Unlearning}, a paradigm that selectively removes biased samples or feature
representations to mitigate diverse forms of bias in vision models. Building on
privacy-preserving unlearning techniques, we evaluate various strategies
including Gradient Ascent, LoRA, and Teacher-Student distillation. Through
empirical analysis on three benchmark datasets, CUB-200-2011 (pose bias),
CIFAR-10 (synthetic patch bias), and CelebA (gender bias in smile detection),
we demonstrate that post-hoc unlearning can substantially reduce subgroup
disparities, with improvements in demographic parity of up to \textbf{94.86\%}
on CUB-200, \textbf{30.28\%} on CIFAR-10, and \textbf{97.37\%} on CelebA. These
gains are achieved with minimal accuracy loss and with methods scoring an
average of 0.62 across the 3 settings on the joint evaluation of utility,
fairness, quality, and privacy. Our findings establish machine unlearning as a
practical framework for enhancing fairness in deployed vision systems without
necessitating full retraining.

However, these techniques require improvement in accuracy. We used GF-1 WFV and

China. Using the style transfer method, we introduced Swin Transformer to
extract global features through attention mechanisms, converting the carbon
stock estimation into an image translation.

Abstract: Despite the rapid advancements in video generation technology, creating
high-quality videos that precisely align with user intentions remains a
significant challenge. Existing methods often fail to achieve fine-grained
control over video details, limiting their practical applicability. We
introduce ANYPORTAL, a novel zero-shot framework for video background
replacement that leverages pre-trained diffusion models. Our framework
collaboratively integrates the temporal prior of video diffusion models with
the relighting capabilities of image diffusion models in a zero-shot setting.
To address the critical challenge of foreground consistency, we propose a
Refinement Projection Algorithm, which enables pixel-level detail manipulation
to ensure precise foreground preservation. ANYPORTAL is training-free and
overcomes the challenges of achieving foreground consistency and temporally
coherent relighting. Experimental results demonstrate that ANYPORTAL achieves
high-quality results on consumer-grade GPUs, offering a practical and efficient
solution for video content creation and editing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络在放射影像分类中表现优异但解释性差，限制了临床接受度。需要开发能够透明归因决策到图像特定区域的自解释架构。

Method: 将图像分割成不重叠的补丁，独立分类每个补丁，然后聚合预测结果，无需后处理技术即可直观可视化每个补丁的诊断贡献。

Result: 在CheXpert数据集上训练，分类性能与EfficientNet-B0相当（AUROC 0.907 vs 0.908），但解释性显著提升：在CheXlocalize数据集上病理定位准确率更高（平均命中率0.485 vs Grad-CAM的0.376）。

Conclusion: MedicalPatchNet通过提供明确可靠的解释，减轻了捷径学习的风险，提高了临床信任度，为医学影像领域提供了更安全、可解释的AI辅助诊断方案。

Abstract: Deep neural networks excel in radiological image classification but
frequently suffer from poor interpretability, limiting clinical acceptance. We
present MedicalPatchNet, an inherently self-explainable architecture for chest
X-ray classification that transparently attributes decisions to distinct image

MedicalPatchNet demonstrates substantially improved interpretability with
higher pathology localization accuracy (mean hit-rate 0.485 vs. 0.376 with
Grad-CAM) on the CheXlocalize dataset. By providing explicit, reliable
explanations accessible even to non-AI experts, MedicalPatchNet mitigates risks

Result: 能够生成生动自然的向量图形动画，在灵活性和动画质量方面显著改善了现有技术的限制

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了向量图形与沉淀模型之间的领域差距问题，实现了高质量的向量图形动画自动生成

Abstract: Vector graphics, known for their scalability and user-friendliness, provide a
unique approach to visual content compared to traditional pixel-based images.
Animation of these graphics, driven by the motion of their elements, offers
enhanced comprehensibility and controllability but often requires substantial
manual effort. To automate this process, we propose a novel method that
integrates implicit neural representations with text-to-video diffusion models
for vector graphic animation. Our approach employs layered implicit neural
representations to reconstruct vector graphics, preserving their inherent
properties such as infinite resolution and precise color and shape constraints,
which effectively bridges the large domain gap between vector graphics and
diffusion models. The neural representations are then optimized using video
score distillation sampling, which leverages motion priors from pretrained
text-to-video diffusion models. Finally, the vector graphics are warped to
match the representations resulting in smooth animation. Experimental results
validate the effectiveness of our method in generating vivid and natural vector
graphic animations, demonstrating significant improvement over existing
techniques that suffer from limitations in flexibility and animation quality.

Abstract: We address vision-language-driven indoor navigation to assist visually

Motivation: 3D高斯泼溅在渲染方面表现出色，但由于表示的非结构化和缺乏显式几何监督，难以实现准确完整的表面重建。

Method: 提出统一框架DiGS，将SDF学习直接嵌入3DGS流程，为每个高斯关联可学习SDF值；设计几何引导的多尺度网格增长策略，自适应地在几何一致区域分布高斯。

Result: 在DTU、Mip-NeRF 360和Tanks&Temples等标准基准测试中，DiGS在保持高渲染保真度的同时，一致提高了重建精度和完整性。

Conclusion: DiGS通过引入SDF学习和几何引导策略，成功解决了3DGS在表面重建方面的挑战，实现了渲染质量和几何重建的双重提升。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently emerged as a powerful paradigm for
photorealistic view synthesis, representing scenes with spatially distributed
Gaussian primitives. While highly effective for rendering, achieving accurate
and complete surface reconstruction remains challenging due to the unstructured
nature of the representation and the absence of explicit geometric supervision.
In this work, we propose DiGS, a unified framework that embeds Signed Distance
Field (SDF) learning directly into the 3DGS pipeline, thereby enforcing strong
and interpretable surface priors. By associating each Gaussian with a learnable
SDF value, DiGS explicitly aligns primitives with underlying geometry and
improves cross-view consistency. To further ensure dense and coherent coverage,
we design a geometry-guided grid growth strategy that adaptively distributes
Gaussians along geometry-consistent regions under a multi-scale hierarchy.
Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks, including DTU, Mip-NeRF 360, and
Tanks& Temples, demonstrate that DiGS consistently improves reconstruction
accuracy and completeness while retaining high rendering fidelity.

TL;DR: 本文提出一种通过局部混合和logits优化的新案例攻击框架，解决传统混合策略破坏全局语义特征和梯度消失问题，显著提高了模型的转移性攻击成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络在遥感应用中容易受到对抗性攻击，当前的混合基础策略存在破坏全局语义特征、导致对抗示例优化偏差以及交叉熵损失造成梯度消失的问题。

Method: 提出三个核心方法：1）局部混合策略，在保持全局语义的前提下生成多样化输入；2）将logit损失适配到非目标攻击场景，缓解梯度消失问题；3）应用波动平滑损失来压制高频噪声和提高转移性。

Result: 在FGSCR-42和MTARSI数据集上进行了涉及6个代理模型和12种最新方法的广泛实验，显示出优异性能。在MTARSI数据集上以ResNet作为代理模型时，黑盒攻击成功率平均提高17.28%。

Conclusion: 该框架通过局部混合和logits优化有效解决了对抗性攻击中的语义一致性和梯度消失问题，显著提高了模型的转移性和黑盒攻击能力，为遥感应用安全提供了有力支撑。

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, posing
significant security threats to their deployment in remote sensing
applications. Research on adversarial attacks not only reveals model
vulnerabilities but also provides critical insights for enhancing robustness.
Although current mixing-based strategies have been proposed to increase the
transferability of adversarial examples, they either perform global blending or
directly exchange a region in the images, which may destroy global semantic
features and mislead the optimization of adversarial examples. Furthermore,
their reliance on cross-entropy loss for perturbation optimization leads to
gradient diminishing during iterative updates, compromising adversarial example
quality. To address these limitations, we focus on non-targeted attacks and
propose a novel framework via local mixing and logits optimization. First, we
present a local mixing strategy to generate diverse yet semantically consistent
inputs. Different from MixUp, which globally blends two images, and MixCut,
which stitches images together, our method merely blends local regions to
preserve global semantic information. Second, we adapt the logit loss from
targeted attacks to non-targeted scenarios, mitigating the gradient vanishing
problem of cross-entropy loss. Third, a perturbation smoothing loss is applied
to suppress high-frequency noise and enhance transferability. Extensive
experiments on FGSCR-42 and MTARSI datasets demonstrate superior performance
over 12 state-of-the-art methods across 6 surrogate models. Notably, with
ResNet as the surrogate on MTARSI, our method achieves a 17.28% average
improvement in black-box attack success rate.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D数据标注成本高昂，而仅依赖2D框标注会引入投影模糊性，且单视角下部分物体可见性使得3D框估计困难

Method: 使用时序多视图聚合物体点云构建完整3D表示，采用Teacher-Student蒸馏范式：Teacher从单视图学习但目标来自时序聚合的静态物体，然后生成高质量伪标签供Student学习

Result: 在nuScenes和Waymo Open数据集上达到最先进的弱监督3D检测性能，显著缩小了与全监督方法的差距

Conclusion: MVAT框架有效解决了弱监督3D检测中的投影模糊性问题，证明了时序多视图信息的重要性，为降低3D标注成本提供了可行方案

Abstract: Annotating 3D data remains a costly bottleneck for 3D object detection,
motivating the development of weakly supervised annotation methods that rely on
more accessible 2D box annotations. However, relying solely on 2D boxes
introduces projection ambiguities since a single 2D box can correspond to
multiple valid 3D poses. Furthermore, partial object visibility under a single
viewpoint setting makes accurate 3D box estimation difficult. We propose MVAT,
a novel framework that leverages temporal multi-view present in sequential data
to address these challenges. Our approach aggregates object-centric point
clouds across time to build 3D object representations as dense and complete as
possible. A Teacher-Student distillation paradigm is employed: The Teacher
network learns from single viewpoints but targets are derived from temporally
aggregated static objects. Then the Teacher generates high quality
pseudo-labels that the Student learns to predict from a single viewpoint for
both static and moving objects. The whole framework incorporates a multi-view
2D projection loss to enforce consistency between predicted 3D boxes and all
available 2D annotations. Experiments on the nuScenes and Waymo Open datasets
demonstrate that MVAT achieves state-of-the-art performance for weakly
supervised 3D object detection, significantly narrowing the gap with fully
supervised methods without requiring any 3D box annotations. % \footnote{Code

Abstract: Hand gesture understanding is essential for several applications in
human-computer interaction, including automatic clinical assessment of hand
dexterity. While deep learning has advanced static gesture recognition, dynamic
gesture understanding remains challenging due to complex spatiotemporal
variations. Moreover, existing datasets often lack multimodal and multi-view
diversity, precise ground-truth tracking, and an action quality component
embedded within gestures. This paper introduces EHWGesture, a multimodal video
dataset for gesture understanding featuring five clinically relevant gestures.
It includes over 1,100 recordings (6 hours), captured from 25 healthy subjects
using two high-resolution RGB-Depth cameras and an event camera. A motion
capture system provides precise ground-truth hand landmark tracking, and all
devices are spatially calibrated and synchronized to ensure cross-modal
alignment. Moreover, to embed an action quality task within gesture
understanding, collected recordings are organized in classes of execution speed
that mirror clinical evaluations of hand dexterity. Baseline experiments
highlight the dataset's potential for gesture classification, gesture trigger
detection, and action quality assessment. Thus, EHWGesture can serve as a
comprehensive benchmark for advancing multimodal clinical gesture
understanding.

TL;DR: UFC是一个通用的少样本控制适配器，能够通过少量样本快速适应新的空间控制任务，在多种扩散模型架构上都能有效工作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的空间控制适配器在面对与训练任务差异较大的新空间控制条件时，适应性有限且训练成本高，需要一种更通用的少样本控制方法。

Method: 提出UFC方法，通过查询条件和支持条件之间的类比来构建任务特定的控制特征，使用匹配机制和小型任务特定参数更新来实现少样本适应。

Result: 在6个新空间控制任务上，仅用30个标注样本微调就能实现精细的空间控制，使用0.1%的全训练数据就能达到与全监督基线相当的性能。

Conclusion: UFC提供了一种高效通用的少样本空间控制解决方案，适用于多种扩散模型架构，显著降低了新控制任务的适应成本。

Abstract: Spatial conditioning in pretrained text-to-image diffusion models has
significantly improved fine-grained control over the structure of generated
images. However, existing control adapters exhibit limited adaptability and
incur high training costs when encountering novel spatial control conditions
that differ substantially from the training tasks. To address this limitation,
we propose Universal Few-Shot Control (UFC), a versatile few-shot control
adapter capable of generalizing to novel spatial conditions. Given a few
image-condition pairs of an unseen task and a query condition, UFC leverages
the analogy between query and support conditions to construct task-specific
control features, instantiated by a matching mechanism and an update on a small
set of task-specific parameters. Experiments on six novel spatial control tasks
show that UFC, fine-tuned with only 30 annotated examples of novel tasks,
achieves fine-grained control consistent with the spatial conditions. Notably,
when fine-tuned with 0.1% of the full training data, UFC achieves competitive
performance with the fully supervised baselines in various control tasks. We
also show that UFC is applicable agnostically to various diffusion backbones
and demonstrate its effectiveness on both UNet and DiT architectures. Code is

TL;DR: 通过HU值基于密度的前景隐码策略改进3D医学图像的Masked Image Modeling，重点关注解剖结构区域，在五个公开数据集上显著提升了分割性能和Dice分数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决随机隐码策略在3D医学图像中忽视解剖结构密度的问题，提高Masked Image Modeling在医学领域的效果。

Method: 利用Hounsfield Unit(HU)测量值实现HU基于前景隐码策略，重点隐码内臭器官等解剖结构的强度分布区域，排除空气、液体等无诊断价值的非组织区域。

Result: 在五个公开3D医学图像数据集(BTCV、Flare22、MM-WHS、Amos22、BraTS)上均显著提升了分割质量和Dice分数，分别达到了84.64%、92.43%、90.67%、88.64%、78.55%。

Conclusion: 领域特定的MIM方法对医学图像表征学习至关重要，HU基于隐码策略为医学图像分割提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: While Masked Image Modeling (MIM) has revolutionized fields of computer
vision, its adoption in 3D medical image computing has been limited by the use
of random masking, which overlooks the density of anatomical objects. To
address this limitation, we enhance the pretext task with a simple yet
effective masking strategy. Leveraging Hounsfield Unit (HU) measurements, we
implement an HU-based Foreground Masking, which focuses on the intensity
distribution of visceral organs and excludes non-tissue regions, such as air
and fluid, that lack diagnostically meaningful features. Extensive experiments
on five public 3D medical imaging datasets demonstrate that our masking
consistently improves performance, both in quality of segmentation and Dice
score (BTCV:~84.64\%, Flare22:~92.43\%, MM-WHS:~90.67\%, Amos22:~88.64\%,
BraTS:~78.55\%). These results underscore the importance of domain-centric MIM
and suggest a promising direction for representation learning in medical image
segmentation. Implementation is available at github.com/AISeedHub/SubFore/.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文档图像蕴含丰富知识，语音查询具有便携性和灵活性，但此前没有工作探索直接在语音查询下对视觉文档图像进行知识库问答

Method: 提出完全无文本的端到端框架，直接解析语音、检索相关视觉知识并生成答案，集成布局感知重排序机制优化检索

Result: 实验显示在效率和准确性方面都有显著提升，并发布了首个中英双语语音-文档RAG数据集

Conclusion: TextlessRAG为语音驱动的文档问答开辟了新方向，提供了高效准确的无文本解决方案

Abstract: Document images encapsulate a wealth of knowledge, while the portability of
spoken queries enables broader and flexible application scenarios. Yet, no
prior work has explored knowledge base question answering over visual document
images with queries provided directly in speech. We propose TextlessRAG, the
first end-to-end framework for speech-based question answering over large-scale
document images. Unlike prior methods, TextlessRAG eliminates ASR, TTS and OCR,
directly interpreting speech, retrieving relevant visual knowledge, and
generating answers in a fully textless pipeline. To further boost performance,
we integrate a layout-aware reranking mechanism to refine retrieval.
Experiments demonstrate substantial improvements in both efficiency and
accuracy. To advance research in this direction, we also release the first
bilingual speech--document RAG dataset, featuring Chinese and English voice
queries paired with multimodal document content. Both the dataset and our
pipeline will be made available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种从前馈框架，从单张无姿态图像合成高斯全头模型，无需GAN反演和测试时优化，实现快速重建和渲染。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖耗时的GAN反演和测试时优化，无法实现快速重建。缺乏大规模3D头部数据集也限制了模型训练效果。

Method: 使用大规模合成数据集训练；提出粗到细的高斯头生成流程，通过FLAME模型的稀疏点与图像特征交互；设计双分支框架聚合球面三平面特征和点基特征。

Result: 实验结果表明该框架在现有工作中表现出有效性，能够实现快速的高质量头部重建。

Conclusion: 该框架实现了从单张无姿态图像快速合成高质量高斯全头模型，为3D头部重建提供了高效的解决方案。

Abstract: We present a feed-forward framework for Gaussian full-head synthesis from a
single unposed image. Unlike previous work that relies on time-consuming GAN
inversion and test-time optimization, our framework can reconstruct the
Gaussian full-head model given a single unposed image in a single forward pass.
This enables fast reconstruction and rendering during inference. To mitigate
the lack of large-scale 3D head assets, we propose a large-scale synthetic
dataset from trained 3D GANs and train our framework using only synthetic data.
For efficient high-fidelity generation, we introduce a coarse-to-fine Gaussian
head generation pipeline, where sparse points from the FLAME model interact
with the image features by transformer blocks for feature extraction and coarse
shape reconstruction, which are then densified for high-fidelity
reconstruction. To fully leverage the prior knowledge residing in pretrained 3D
GANs for effective reconstruction, we propose a dual-branch framework that
effectively aggregates the structured spherical triplane feature and
unstructured point-based features for more effective Gaussian head
reconstruction. Experimental results show the effectiveness of our framework
towards existing work.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了Class Node Graph Attention Network (CGAT)架构，用于3D形状识别任务的可解释深度学习，特别应用于CBCT图像中第三磨牙的Demirjian分期分类，通过注意力机制提供决策解释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习在黑盒性质限制了其在高风险应用中的采用，特别是在需要信任和问责制的医学和法医学领域。为了解决3D形状识别任务的可解释性问题，需要开发能够提供透明决策过程的模型。

Method: 使用图注意力卷积和固有注意力机制构建CGAT架构，应用于从CBCT图像提取的3D网格数据。评估了局部平均曲率和到质心距离的节点特征（单独和组合使用），以及模型深度，并通过注意力rollout可视化决策过程。

Result: 结合局部平均曲率和到质心距离作为节点特征的模型获得了0.76的加权F1分数，性能略有提升，并产生更全面的注意力可视化。包含指向全局CLS节点有向边的模型产生了更直观的注意力图，同时保持了良好的分类性能。

Conclusion: CGAT架构能够生成人类可理解的注意力图，增强信任并促进专家验证模型决策。虽然演示在牙科数据上，但CGAT广泛适用于基于图的分类和回归任务，推动透明且具有竞争力的深度学习模型在高风险环境中的更广泛采用。

Abstract: Deep learning offers a promising avenue for automating many recognition tasks
in fields such as medicine and forensics. However, the black-box nature of
these models hinders their adoption in high-stakes applications where trust and
accountability are required. For 3D shape recognition tasks in particular, this
paper introduces the Class Node Graph Attention Network (CGAT) architecture to
address this need. Applied to 3D meshes of third molars derived from CBCT
images, for Demirjian stage allocation, CGAT utilizes graph attention
convolutions and an inherent attention mechanism, visualized via attention
rollout, to explain its decision-making process. We evaluated the local mean
curvature and distance to centroid node features, both individually and in
combination, as well as model depth, finding that models incorporating directed
edges to a global CLS node produced more intuitive attention maps, while also
yielding desirable classification performance. We analyzed the attention-based
explanations of the models, and their predictive performances to propose
optimal settings for the CGAT. The combination of local mean curvature and
distance to centroid as node features yielded a slight performance increase
with 0.76 weighted F1 score, and more comprehensive attention visualizations.
The CGAT architecture's ability to generate human-understandable attention maps
can enhance trust and facilitate expert validation of model decisions. While
demonstrated on dental data, CGAT is broadly applicable to graph-based
classification and regression tasks, promoting wider adoption of transparent
and competitive deep learning models in high-stakes environments.

Abstract: Temporal image forensics is the science of estimating the age of a digital
image. Usually, time-dependent traces (age traces) introduced by the image
acquisition pipeline are exploited for this purpose. In this review, a
comprehensive overview of the field of temporal image forensics based on
time-dependent traces from the image acquisition pipeline is given. This
includes a detailed insight into the properties of known age traces (i.e.,
in-field sensor defects and sensor dust) and temporal image forensics
techniques. Another key aspect of this work is to highlight the problem of
content bias and to illustrate how important eXplainable Artificial
Intelligence methods are to verify the reliability of temporal image forensics
techniques. Apart from reviewing material presented in previous works, in this
review: (i) a new (probably more realistic) forensic setting is proposed; (ii)
the main properties (growth rate and spatial distribution) of in-field sensor
defects are verified; (iii) it is shown that a method proposed to utilize
in-field sensor defects for image age approximation actually exploits other
traces (most likely content bias); (iv) the features learned by a neural
network dating palmprint images are further investigated; (v) it is shown how
easily a neural network can be distracted from learning age traces. For this
purpose, previous work is analyzed, re-implemented if required and experiments
are conducted.

TL;DR: 研究发现视觉语言基础模型中的性别偏见评估存在严重问题，即使对非性别特征进行微小扰动也会显著改变偏见分数，表明当前评估方法不可靠。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于真实图像的性别偏见评估基准存在性别与非性别特征（如物体和背景）之间的虚假相关性，这可能导致性别偏见评估失真。

Method: 系统性地扰动四个广泛使用的基准（COCO-gender、FACET、MIAP、PHASE）中的非性别特征，并量化这些扰动对各种VLMs偏见评估的影响。

Result: 即使最小扰动（如仅遮蔽10%物体或轻微模糊背景）也能显著改变偏见分数，生成式VLMs指标变化高达175%，CLIP变体变化达43%。

Conclusion: 当前偏见评估往往反映模型对虚假特征而非性别偏见的响应，建议在报告偏见指标时同时报告特征敏感性测量以提高评估可靠性。

Abstract: Gender bias in vision-language foundation models (VLMs) raises concerns about
their safe deployment and is typically evaluated using benchmarks with gender
annotations on real-world images. However, as these benchmarks often contain
spurious correlations between gender and non-gender features, such as objects
and backgrounds, we identify a critical oversight in gender bias evaluation: Do
spurious features distort gender bias evaluation? To address this question, we
systematically perturb non-gender features across four widely used benchmarks
(COCO-gender, FACET, MIAP, and PHASE) and various VLMs to quantify their impact
on bias evaluation. Our findings reveal that even minimal perturbations, such
as masking just 10% of objects or weakly blurring backgrounds, can dramatically
alter bias scores, shifting metrics by up to 175% in generative VLMs and 43% in
CLIP variants. This suggests that current bias evaluations often reflect model
responses to spurious features rather than gender bias, undermining their
reliability. Since creating spurious feature-free benchmarks is fundamentally
challenging, we recommend reporting bias metrics alongside feature-sensitivity
measurements to enable a more reliable bias assessment.

Motivation: 解决现有医疗视觉-语言模型对患者元数据利用不充分、缺乏临床诊断知识集成、计算资源消耗大以3D医学影像效果有限等问题。

Method: 使用结构化元数据生成合成报告以改善图像-文本对齐，添加预测MMSE评分的辅助token提供警督，采用轻量级图像和文本提示调整技术。

Result: 在两个阿尔茬海默病数据集上达到最高性能，仅需1500张训练图像就超过了需10000张图像训练的现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法能够高效地适配3D医学视觉-语言模型，在少量数据下实现优异的阿尔茬海默病诊断性能，为临床应用提供了实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Medical vision-language models (Med-VLMs) have shown impressive results in
tasks such as report generation and visual question answering, but they still
face several limitations. Most notably, they underutilize patient metadata and
lack integration of clinical diagnostic knowledge. Moreover, most existing
models are typically trained from scratch or fine-tuned on large-scale 2D
image-text pairs, requiring extensive computational resources, and their
effectiveness on 3D medical imaging is often limited due to the absence of
structural information. To address these gaps, we propose a data-efficient
fine-tuning pipeline to adapt 3D CT-based Med-VLMs for 3D MRI and demonstrate
its application in Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis. Our system introduces
two key innovations. First, we convert structured metadata into synthetic
reports, enriching textual input for improved image-text alignment. Second, we
add an auxiliary token trained to predict the mini-mental state examination
(MMSE) score, a widely used clinical measure of cognitive function that
correlates with AD severity. This provides additional supervision for
fine-tuning. Applying lightweight prompt tuning to both image and text
modalities, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on two AD
datasets using 1,500 training images, outperforming existing methods fine-tuned
on 10,000 images. Code will be released upon publication.

Motivation: 解决传统深度学习方法对大量标签数据的依赖以及表征可解释性不足的问题。

Method: 提出自监督跨编码器框架，利用纵向MRI扫描的时间连续性进行监督，将表征解耦为静态解剖表征（通过对比学习约束）和动态表征（通过输入梯度正则化指导）。

Result: 在ADNI数据集上实现了更高的分类准确率和改善的可解释性，并在OASIS数据集上展现出强大的零样本通用能力，在PPMI数据集上展现出跨任务通用能力。

Conclusion: 该方法为神经退行性疾病的MRI诊断提供了一种无需大量标签数据且具有良好可解释性的解决方案，具有强大的通用能力。

Abstract: Deep learning has shown significant potential in diagnosing neurodegenerative
diseases from MRI data. However, most existing methods rely heavily on large
volumes of labeled data and often yield representations that lack
interpretability. To address both challenges, we propose a novel
self-supervised cross-encoder framework that leverages the temporal continuity
in longitudinal MRI scans for supervision. This framework disentangles learned
representations into two components: a static representation, constrained by
contrastive learning, which captures stable anatomical features; and a dynamic
representation, guided by input-gradient regularization, which reflects
temporal changes and can be effectively fine-tuned for downstream
classification tasks. Experimental results on the Alzheimer's Disease
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset demonstrate that our method achieves
superior classification accuracy and improved interpretability. Furthermore,
the learned representations exhibit strong zero-shot generalization on the Open
Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS) dataset and cross-task generalization
on the Parkinson Progression Marker Initiative (PPMI) dataset. The code for the
proposed method will be made publicly available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语义水印技术在再生攻击下表现良好，但因频率完整性损失导致检测性能下降，需要解决这一根本问题。

Method: 采用Hermitian对称约束保持频率完整性，结合中心感知嵌入策略确保信息在裁剪攻击下的鲁棒保留。

Result: 在各种攻击场景下实现了最先进的验证和识别性能，同时保持优异的图像保真度(FID和CLIP分数)。

Conclusion: SFW框架有效平衡了鲁棒性和图像保真度，解决了语义水印中的固有权衡问题。

Abstract: Semantic watermarking techniques for latent diffusion models (LDMs) are
robust against regeneration attacks, but often suffer from detection
performance degradation due to the loss of frequency integrity. To tackle this
problem, we propose a novel embedding method called Hermitian Symmetric Fourier
Watermarking (SFW), which maintains frequency integrity by enforcing Hermitian
symmetry. Additionally, we introduce a center-aware embedding strategy that
reduces the vulnerability of semantic watermarking due to cropping attacks by
ensuring robust information retention. To validate our approach, we apply these
techniques to existing semantic watermarking schemes, enhancing their
frequency-domain structures for better robustness and retrieval accuracy.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our methods achieve state-of-the-art
verification and identification performance, surpassing previous approaches
across various attack scenarios. Ablation studies confirm the impact of SFW on
detection capabilities, the effectiveness of the center-aware embedding against
cropping, and how message capacity influences identification accuracy. Notably,
our method achieves the highest detection accuracy while maintaining superior
image fidelity, as evidenced by FID and CLIP scores. Conclusively, our proposed
SFW is shown to be an effective framework for balancing robustness and image
fidelity, addressing the inherent trade-offs in semantic watermarking. Code

Conclusion: 该方法通过张量低秩分解的理论基础和深度学习框架，成功地解决了复杂环境下小目标检测的挑战，为防御应用提供了一种稳健而普适的解决方案。

Abstract: Small moving target detection is crucial for many defense applications but
remains highly challenging due to low signal-to-noise ratios, ambiguous visual
cues, and cluttered backgrounds. In this work, we propose a novel deep learning
framework that differs fundamentally from existing approaches, which often rely
on target-specific features or motion cues and tend to lack robustness in
complex environments. Our key insight is that small target detection and
background discrimination are inherently coupled, even cluttered video
backgrounds often exhibit strong low-rank structures that can serve as stable
priors for detection. We reformulate the task as a tensor-based low-rank and
sparse decomposition problem and conduct a theoretical analysis of the
background, target, and noise components to guide model design. Building on
these insights, we introduce TenRPCANet, a deep neural network that requires
minimal assumptions about target characteristics. Specifically, we propose a
tokenization strategy that implicitly enforces multi-order tensor low-rank
priors through a self-attention mechanism. This mechanism captures both local
and non-local self-similarity to model the low-rank background without relying
on explicit iterative optimization. In addition, inspired by the sparse
component update in tensor RPCA, we design a feature refinement module to
enhance target saliency. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art
performance on two highly distinct and challenging tasks: multi-frame infrared
small target detection and space object detection. These results demonstrate
both the effectiveness and the generalizability of our approach.

Abstract: Visual reasoning over structured data such as tables is a critical capability
for modern vision-language models (VLMs), yet current benchmarks remain limited
in scale, diversity, or reasoning depth, especially when it comes to rendered
table images. Addressing this gap, we introduce Visual-TableQA, a large-scale,
open-domain multimodal dataset specifically designed to evaluate and enhance
visual reasoning over complex tabular data. Our generation pipeline is modular,
scalable, and fully autonomous, involving multiple reasoning LLMs collaborating
across distinct roles: generation, validation, and inspiration. Visual-TableQA
comprises 2.5k richly structured LaTeX-rendered tables and 6k
reasoning-intensive QA pairs, all produced at a cost of under USD 100. To
promote diversity and creativity, our pipeline performs multi-model
collaborative data generation via cross-model prompting ('inspiration') and
LLM-jury filtering. Stronger models seed layouts and topics that weaker models
elaborate, collectively distilling diverse reasoning patterns and visual
structures into the dataset. Empirical results show that models fine-tuned on
Visual-TableQA generalize robustly to external benchmarks, outperforming
several proprietary models despite the dataset's synthetic nature. The full
pipeline and resources are publicly available at

multi-grid homography, or thin-plate spline often struggle with real scenes
containing depth disparities due to their inherent limitations. To address
this, we propose an Exponential-Decay Free-Form Deformation Network (EDFFDNet),
which employs free-form deformation with an exponential-decay basis function.
This design achieves higher efficiency and performs well in scenes with depth
disparities, benefiting from its inherent locality. We also introduce an
Adaptive Sparse Motion Aggregator (ASMA), which replaces the MLP motion
aggregator used in previous methods. By transforming dense interactions into
sparse ones, ASMA reduces parameters and improves accuracy. Additionally, we
propose a progressive correlation refinement strategy that leverages
global-local correlation patterns for coarse-to-fine motion estimation, further
enhancing efficiency and accuracy. Experiments demonstrate that EDFFDNet
reduces parameters, memory, and total runtime by 70.5%, 32.6%, and 33.7%,
respectively, while achieving a 0.5 dB PSNR gain over the state-of-the-art
method. With an additional local refinement stage,EDFFDNet-2 further improves
PSNR by 1.06 dB while maintaining lower computational costs. Our method also
demonstrates strong generalization ability across datasets, outperforming
previous deep learning methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有开源多模态模型在视觉问题中推理模式单调、交互轮次限制的问题，特别是对需要尝试错误探索的复杂任务

Method: 1）构建Visual Probe数据集；2）迭代收集多样化推理轨迹；3）过轮掩码策略以避免回应拖尾处罚

Result: 仅训练6轮上限却能生成十几轮的推理轨迹，准确性随轮次增加而提升，在具挑战性视觉搜索任务中达到最佳性能

Conclusion: 系统能够产生丰富的推理模式和深度思考路径，有效解决复杂视觉搜索问题，为多模态模型的深度推理提供了新方向

Abstract: Recent advances in large multimodal models have leveraged image-based tools
with reinforcement learning to tackle visual problems. However, existing
open-source approaches often exhibit monotonous reasoning patterns and allow
only a limited number of interaction turns, making them inadequate for
difficult tasks that require trial-and-error exploration. In this work, we
address this limitation by scaling up tool-based interactions and introduce
Mini-o3, a system that executes deep, multi-turn reasoning -- spanning tens of
steps -- and achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging visual search
tasks. Our recipe for reproducing OpenAI o3-style behaviors comprises three key
components. First, we construct the Visual Probe Dataset, a collection of
thousands of challenging visual search problems designed for exploratory
reasoning. Second, we develop an iterative data collection pipeline to obtain
cold-start trajectories that exhibit diverse reasoning patterns, including
depth-first search, trial-and-error, and goal maintenance. Third, we propose an
over-turn masking strategy that prevents penalization of over-turn responses
(those that hit the maximum number of turns) during reinforcement learning,
thereby balancing training-time efficiency with test-time scalability. Despite
training with an upper bound of only six interaction turns, our model generates
trajectories that naturally scale to tens of turns at inference time, with
accuracy improving as the number of turns increases. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that Mini-o3 produces rich reasoning patterns and deep thinking
paths, effectively solving challenging visual search problems.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的对抗训练框架，通过消除特征空间中的类间依赖关系来增强深度神经网络的对抗鲁棒性，在多个基准测试中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络在图像分类中表现出色但容易受到对抗样本攻击。标准对抗训练虽然能增强鲁棒性，但未能显式处理类间特征重叠这一导致对抗脆弱性的重要因素。

Method: 提出新颖的对抗训练框架，通过在特征空间中消除对抗样本和干净样本的类间依赖关系来减轻类间邻近性。具体包括识别每个对抗样本的最邻近类间邻居，并移除这些邻居上的投影以增强特征可分性。

Result: 在CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100和SVHN等标准基准测试中，该方法表现出与领先对抗训练技术相竞争的性能，在鲁棒准确率和干净准确率方面均取得显著成就。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，显式处理类间特征邻近性对于增强深度神经网络的对抗鲁棒性具有重要意义，理论分析显示该方法通过降低Lipschitz常数和Rademacher复杂度来改善泛化和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Deep neural networks have exhibited impressive performance in image
classification tasks but remain vulnerable to adversarial examples. Standard
adversarial training enhances robustness but typically fails to explicitly
address inter-class feature overlap, a significant contributor to adversarial
susceptibility. In this work, we introduce a novel adversarial training
framework that actively mitigates inter-class proximity by projecting out
inter-class dependencies from adversarial and clean samples in the feature
space. Specifically, our approach first identifies the nearest inter-class
neighbors for each adversarial sample and subsequently removes projections onto
these neighbors to enforce stronger feature separability. Theoretically, we
demonstrate that our proposed logits correction reduces the Lipschitz constant
of neural networks, thereby lowering the Rademacher complexity, which directly
contributes to improved generalization and robustness. Extensive experiments
across standard benchmarks including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and SVHN show that
our method demonstrates strong performance that is competitive with leading
adversarial training techniques, highlighting significant achievements in both
robust and clean accuracy. Our findings reveal the importance of addressing
inter-class feature proximity explicitly to bolster adversarial robustness in
DNNs.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管短视频感知能力很强，但复杂推理任务和长视频的表现仍有限。但问是能否利用现有感知能力来执行更复杂的视频推理？

Method: 开发了一个大语言模型代理，给它配备视频模块作为子代理或工具。代理根据每次调用模块的结果决定后续步骤，而非固定流程。受文本推理领域的启发，引入了批评器来区分成功和失败的执行序列。

Result: 组合代理和批评器的方法在LVBench、Neptune和ActivityNet-RTL等数据集上得到了强劲的表现

Conclusion: 通过将大语言模型代理与视频模块相结合，并使用动态的执行策略和批评机制，可以有效提升复杂视频推理任务的性能

Abstract: Video understanding has seen significant progress in recent years, with
models' performance on perception from short clips continuing to rise. Yet,
multiple recent benchmarks, such as LVBench, Neptune, and ActivityNet-RTL, show
performance wanes for tasks requiring complex reasoning on videos as queries
grow more complex and videos grow longer. In this work, we ask: can existing
perception capabilities be leveraged to successfully perform more complex video
reasoning? In particular, we develop a large language model agent given access
to video modules as subagents or tools. Rather than following a fixed procedure
to solve queries as in previous work such as Visual Programming, ViperGPT, and
MoReVQA, the agent uses the results of each call to a module to determine
subsequent steps. Inspired by work in the textual reasoning domain, we
introduce a critic to distinguish between instances of successful and
unsuccessful sequences from the agent. We show that the combination of our
agent and critic achieve strong performance on the previously-mentioned
datasets.

TL;DR: SEEC是一种基于语义分割的多熵模型无损图像压缩方法，通过为不同语义区域分配专用熵模型来提升压缩性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有学习方法大多使用单一熵模型估计整个图像的概率分布，无法有效捕捉不同语义区域的多样化统计特征

Method: 利用语义分割识别不同区域，为每个区域分配专用熵模型，采用多通道离散逻辑混合似然建模像素值分布

Result: 在基准数据集上实现了最先进的压缩比，同时只引入最小的编码和解码延迟

Conclusion: SEEC框架通过多熵模型方法显著提升了无损图像压缩性能，并支持基于分割掩码的感兴趣区域编码

Abstract: Recently, learned image compression has attracted considerable attention due
to its superior performance over traditional methods. However, most existing
approaches employ a single entropy model to estimate the probability
distribution of pixel values across the entire image, which limits their
ability to capture the diverse statistical characteristics of different
semantic regions. To overcome this limitation, we propose Segmentation-Assisted
Multi-Entropy Models for Lossless Image Compression (SEEC). Our framework
utilizes semantic segmentation to guide the selection and adaptation of
multiple entropy models, enabling more accurate probability distribution
estimation for distinct semantic regions. Specifically, SEEC first extracts
image features and then applies semantic segmentation to identify different
regions, each assigned a specialized entropy model to better capture its unique
statistical properties. Finally, a multi-channel discrete logistic mixture
likelihood is employed to model the pixel value distributions effectively.
Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that SEEC achieves
state-of-the-art compression ratios while introducing only minimal encoding and
decoding latency. With superior performance, the proposed model also supports
Regions of Interest (ROIs) coding condition on the provided segmentation mask.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 中风是全球第二大死因，复发率高且死亡率达40%，极需提前识别高风险患者以降低复发率

Method: 收集3D脱内CTA图像数据和临床数据（心脏疾病、年龄、性别），训练单模态和多模态深度学习模型，进行二分类复发检测和生存时间预测

Result: 多模态XSRD-net模型在测试集上获得c-index 0.68和AUC 0.71，发现心脏疾病（表格数据）与颈动脉（图像数据）在复发预测中具有关联性

Conclusion: 多模态深度学习模型能够有效预测中风复发风险，心脏疾病和颈动脉状况是关键风险因素，需要继续收集数据以优化模型

Abstract: Stroke is the second most frequent cause of death world wide with an annual
mortality of around 5.5 million. Recurrence rates of stroke are between 5 and
25% in the first year. As mortality rates for relapses are extraordinarily high
(40%) it is of utmost importance to reduce the recurrence rates. We address
this issue by detecting patients at risk of stroke recurrence at an early stage
in order to enable appropriate therapy planning. To this end we collected 3D
intracranial CTA image data and recorded concomitant heart diseases, the age
and the gender of stroke patients between 2010 and 2024. We trained single- and
multimodal deep learning based neural networks for binary relapse detection
(Task 1) and for relapse free survival (RFS) time prediction together with a
subsequent classification (Task 2). The separation of relapse from non-relapse
patients (Task 1) could be solved with tabular data (AUC on test dataset:
0.84). However, for the main task, the regression (Task 2), our multimodal
XSRD-net processed the modalities vision:tabular with 0.68:0.32 according to
modality contribution measures. The c-index with respect to relapses for the
multimodal model reached 0.68, and the AUC is 0.71 for the test dataset. Final,
deeper interpretability analysis results could highlight a link between both
heart diseases (tabular) and carotid arteries (vision) for the detection of
relapses and the prediction of the RFS time. This is a central outcome that we
strive to strengthen with ongoing data collection and model retraining.

Motivation: 虚拟现实和数字人建模应用中需要高质量的头发重建，现有方法往往忽视发丝的连通性和拓扑结构

Method: 多阶段管道：首先使用可微分高斯光栅化器重建详细几何，然后通过新颖的合并方案将高斯段合并为连贯发丝，最后在光度监督下优化和生长发丝

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上验证了方法对各种发型的鲁棒性，重建通常在1小时内完成

Conclusion: 该方法成功扩展了3DGS框架，实现了发丝级的头发重建，并提出了评估拓扑准确性的新指标

Abstract: Human hair reconstruction is a challenging problem in computer vision, with
growing importance for applications in virtual reality and digital human
modeling. Recent advances in 3D Gaussians Splatting (3DGS) provide efficient
and explicit scene representations that naturally align with the structure of
hair strands. In this work, we extend the 3DGS framework to enable strand-level
hair geometry reconstruction from multi-view images. Our multi-stage pipeline
first reconstructs detailed hair geometry using a differentiable Gaussian
rasterizer, then merges individual Gaussian segments into coherent strands
through a novel merging scheme, and finally refines and grows the strands under
photometric supervision.
  While existing methods typically evaluate reconstruction quality at the
geometric level, they often neglect the connectivity and topology of hair
strands. To address this, we propose a new evaluation metric that serves as a
proxy for assessing topological accuracy in strand reconstruction. Extensive
experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our
method robustly handles a wide range of hairstyles and achieves efficient
reconstruction, typically completing within one hour.

Motivation: RayGauss虽然在合成和室内场景的新视角合成中达到了最先进的渲染质量，但其计算成本过高，无法在真实世界场景中实现实时渲染。

Method: 1. 引入体积渲染加速策略（空空间跳过和自适应采样）
2. 增强光线一致性
3. 引入尺度正则化以减少假阳性交叉
4. 提出新的致密化准则以改善远距离区域的密度分布

Result: 在真实世界数据集上：

- 视觉质量PSNR提升达+0.56dB

Conclusion: RayGaussX成功解决了RayGauss的计算效率问题，在保持高质量渲染的同时实现了显著的训练和推理加速，为真实世界场景的实时新视角合成提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: RayGauss has achieved state-of-the-art rendering quality for novel-view
synthesis on synthetic and indoor scenes by representing radiance and density
fields with irregularly distributed elliptical basis functions, rendered via
volume ray casting using a Bounding Volume Hierarchy (BVH). However, its
computational cost prevents real-time rendering on real-world scenes. Our
approach, RayGaussX, builds on RayGauss by introducing key contributions that
accelerate both training and inference. Specifically, we incorporate volumetric
rendering acceleration strategies such as empty-space skipping and adaptive
sampling, enhance ray coherence, and introduce scale regularization to reduce
false-positive intersections. Additionally, we propose a new densification
criterion that improves density distribution in distant regions, leading to
enhanced graphical quality on larger scenes. As a result, RayGaussX achieves 5x
to 12x faster training and 50x to 80x higher rendering speeds (FPS) on
real-world datasets while improving visual quality by up to +0.56 dB in PSNR.

Motivation: 解决医学MR成像中高分边率与扫描时间、病人舒适度的平衡问题，避免分别分析低分边率图像导致的时间浪费和误差

Method: 使用自监督多视角神经网络，采用稀疏坐标基损失函数支持任意缩放比例，结合病人无关离线和病人特定在线阶段

Result: 在两个独立的MR图像数据集上评估，超分边率性能可比或更优于现有自监督方法，病人特定重建速度提升10倍以上

Conclusion: 该方法能够在不需高分边率数据的情况下，高效地融合多个低分边率扫描生成高质量图像，具有重要的临床应用价值

Abstract: Acquiring images in high resolution is often a challenging task. Especially
in the medical sector, image quality has to be balanced with acquisition time
and patient comfort. To strike a compromise between scan time and quality for
Magnetic Resonance (MR) imaging, two anisotropic scans with different
low-resolution (LR) orientations can be acquired. Typically, LR scans are
analyzed individually by radiologists, which is time consuming and can lead to
inaccurate interpretation. To tackle this, we propose a novel approach for
fusing two orthogonal anisotropic LR MR images to reconstruct anatomical
details in a unified representation. Our multi-view neural network is trained
in a self-supervised manner, without requiring corresponding high-resolution
(HR) data. To optimize the model, we introduce a sparse coordinate-based loss,
enabling the integration of LR images with arbitrary scaling. We evaluate our
method on MR images from two independent cohorts. Our results demonstrate
comparable or even improved super-resolution (SR) performance compared to
state-of-the-art (SOTA) self-supervised SR methods for different upsampling
scales. By combining a patient-agnostic offline and a patient-specific online
phase, we achieve a substantial speed-up of up to ten times for
patient-specific reconstruction while achieving similar or better SR quality.

Motivation: 3D高斯泼溅技术虽然能创建逼真的3D场景表示，但在修复遮挡或编辑导致的缺失区域时仍存在模糊细节、伪影和几何不一致等挑战

Method: 结合两种关键思想：(1)基于深度和对象的联合监督确保修复的高斯点准确放置在3D空间中并与周围几何对齐；(2)一致性感知细化方案选择性地识别和修正不一致区域而不破坏场景其他部分

Result: 在SPIn-NeRF数据集上的评估显示，SplatFill在视觉保真度上超越现有NeRF和3DGS修复方法，同时减少24.5%的训练时间，能提供更清晰的细节、更少的伪影和更好的视角一致性

Conclusion: SplatFill通过深度引导和一致性优化，成功解决了3DGS场景修复中的关键问题，实现了高质量和高效率的场景修复

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has enabled the creation of highly realistic 3D
scene representations from sets of multi-view images. However, inpainting
missing regions, whether due to occlusion or scene editing, remains a
challenging task, often leading to blurry details, artifacts, and inconsistent
geometry. In this work, we introduce SplatFill, a novel depth-guided approach
for 3DGS scene inpainting that achieves state-of-the-art perceptual quality and
improved efficiency. Our method combines two key ideas: (1) joint depth-based
and object-based supervision to ensure inpainted Gaussians are accurately
placed in 3D space and aligned with surrounding geometry, and (2) we propose a
consistency-aware refinement scheme that selectively identifies and corrects
inconsistent regions without disrupting the rest of the scene. Evaluations on
the SPIn-NeRF dataset demonstrate that SplatFill not only surpasses existing
NeRF-based and 3DGS-based inpainting methods in visual fidelity but also
reduces training time by 24.5%. Qualitative results show our method delivers
sharper details, fewer artifacts, and greater coherence across challenging
viewpoints.

Motivation: 解决大型语言模型与3D点云之间的表示不对齐问题，现有方法在输入输出阶段都存在限制，影响语义理解和几何精度

Method: 提出Point Linguist Model (PLM)框架，包含Object-centric Discriminative Representation (OcDR)学习对象中心token，以及Geometric Reactivation Decoder (GRD)结合语义推理和密集特征进行精确分割

Result: 在ScanNetv2上提升7.3 mIoU，在Multi3DRefer上提升6.0 mIoU，在7个基准测试的4个不同任务中均取得一致性能提升

Conclusion: PLM通过全面的对象中心推理有效解决了3D表示对齐问题，实现了鲁棒的3D理解

Abstract: 3D object segmentation with Large Language Models (LLMs) has become a
prevailing paradigm due to its broad semantics, task flexibility, and strong
generalization. However, this paradigm is hindered by representation
misalignment: LLMs process high-level semantic tokens, whereas 3D point clouds
convey only dense geometric structures. In prior methods, misalignment limits
both input and output. At the input stage, dense point patches require heavy
pre-alignment, weakening object-level semantics and confusing similar
distractors. At the output stage, predictions depend only on dense features
without explicit geometric cues, leading to a loss of fine-grained accuracy. To
address these limitations, we present the Point Linguist Model (PLM), a general
framework that bridges the representation gap between LLMs and dense 3D point
clouds without requiring large-scale pre-alignment between 3D-text or
3D-images. Specifically, we introduce Object-centric Discriminative
Representation (OcDR), which learns object-centric tokens that capture target
semantics and scene relations under a hard negative-aware training objective.
This mitigates the misalignment between LLM tokens and 3D points, enhances
resilience to distractors, and facilitates semantic-level reasoning within
LLMs. For accurate segmentation, we introduce the Geometric Reactivation
Decoder (GRD), which predicts masks by combining OcDR tokens carrying
LLM-inferred geometry with corresponding dense features, preserving
comprehensive dense features throughout the pipeline. Extensive experiments
show that PLM achieves significant improvements of +7.3 mIoU on ScanNetv2 and
+6.0 mIoU on Multi3DRefer for 3D referring segmentation, with consistent gains
across 7 benchmarks spanning 4 different tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness
of comprehensive object-centric reasoning for robust 3D understanding.

Conclusion: D-LEAF方法通过细粒度的注意力分析，能够有效定位和修正多模态大语言模型中的幻觉问题，显著提升模型性能且计算开销极小。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) achieve strong performance on tasks
like image captioning and visual question answering, but remain prone to
hallucinations, where generated text conflicts with the visual input. Prior
work links this partly to insufficient visual attention, but existing
attention-based detectors and mitigation typically apply uniform adjustments
across layers and heads, obscuring where errors originate. In this paper, we
first show these methods fail to accurately localize problematic layers. Then,
we introduce two diagnostics: Layer Image Attention Entropy (LIAE) which flags
anomalous layers, and Image Attention Focus (IAF) which scores attention heads
within those layers. Analysis shows that LIAE pinpoints faulty layers and IAF
reliably ranks heads that warrant correction. Guided by these signals, we
propose Dynamic Layer-wise Entropy and Attention Fusion (D-LEAF), a
task-agnostic, attention-guided method that dynamically localizes and corrects
errors during inference with negligible overhead. Results show our D-LEAF
delivers a 53% relative improvement on standard captioning benchmarks, and on
VQA both accuracy and F1-score improve by approximately 4%, substantially
suppressing hallucinations while preserving efficiency.

Conclusion: Active MINT及相关方法发展有助于增加AI模型的透明度，促进AI部署中更强的安全保障

Abstract: Active Membership Inference Test (aMINT) is a method designed to detect
whether given data were used during the training of machine learning models. In
Active MINT, we propose a novel multitask learning process that involves
training simultaneously two models: the original or Audited Model, and a
secondary model, referred to as the MINT Model, responsible for identifying the
data used for training the Audited Model. This novel multi-task learning
approach has been designed to incorporate the auditability of the model as an
optimization objective during the training process of neural networks. The
proposed approach incorporates intermediate activation maps as inputs to the
MINT layers, which are trained to enhance the detection of training data. We
present results using a wide range of neural networks, from lighter
architectures such as MobileNet to more complex ones such as Vision
Transformers, evaluated in 5 public benchmarks. Our proposed Active MINT
achieves over 80% accuracy in detecting if given data was used for training,
significantly outperforming previous approaches in the literature. Our aMINT

### [68] [Object-level Correlation for Few-Shot Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07917)
*Chunlin Wen,Yu Zhang,Jie Fan,Hongyuan Zhu,Xiu-Shen Wei,Yijun Wang,Zhiqiang Kou,Shuzhou Sun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OCNet提出了一种基于物体级相关性的少样本语义分割方法，通过建立支持目标物体与查询通用物体之间的相关性，有效抑制背景噪声并提升分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有少样本语义分割方法主要建立图像级相关性，但这种方法包含难以追踪和抑制的硬像素噪声（如无关背景物体），导致背景过拟合。受生物视觉过程启发，作者认为在物体级信息中识别新物体比在整个图像中更有效。

Method: 设计了Object-level Correlation Network (OCNet)，包含General Object Mining Module (GOMM)和Correlation Construction Module (CCM)。GOMM通过学习显著性和高层相似性线索构建查询通用物体特征，CCM通过分配目标原型来匹配通用物体特征建立物体级相关性。

Result: 在PASCAL-5i和COCO-20i数据集上的大量实验表明，该模型达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 通过建立物体级相关性而非图像级相关性，OCNet能够有效挖掘查询目标特征并抑制硬像素噪声，在少样本语义分割任务中取得了优异性能。

Abstract: Few-shot semantic segmentation (FSS) aims to segment objects of novel
categories in the query images given only a few annotated support samples.
Existing methods primarily build the image-level correlation between the
support target object and the entire query image. However, this correlation
contains the hard pixel noise, \textit{i.e.}, irrelevant background objects,
that is intractable to trace and suppress, leading to the overfitting of the
background. To address the limitation of this correlation, we imitate the
biological vision process to identify novel objects in the object-level
information. Target identification in the general objects is more valid than in
the entire image, especially in the low-data regime. Inspired by this, we
design an Object-level Correlation Network (OCNet) by establishing the
object-level correlation between the support target object and query general
objects, which is mainly composed of the General Object Mining Module (GOMM)
and Correlation Construction Module (CCM). Specifically, GOMM constructs the
query general object feature by learning saliency and high-level similarity
cues, where the general objects include the irrelevant background objects and
the target foreground object. Then, CCM establishes the object-level
correlation by allocating the target prototypes to match the general object
feature. The generated object-level correlation can mine the query target
feature and suppress the hard pixel noise for the final prediction. Extensive
experiments on PASCAL-${5}^{i}$ and COCO-${20}^{i}$ show that our model
achieves the state-of-the-art performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ScoreHOI是一个基于扩散先验的优化器，通过扩散模型的分数引导采样和物理约束，实现更精确的人-物交互重建，并提出了接触驱动的迭代细化方法来提高重建精度。


<details>

Motivation: 现有优化方法由于缺乏人-物交互的先验知识，难以获得物理上合理的人-物交互重建结果。

Method: 利用扩散模型的分数引导采样可控性，重建给定图像观察和物体特征条件下的人体和物体姿态条件分布；在推理时通过物理约束引导去噪过程；提出接触驱动的迭代细化方法。

Result: 在标准基准测试中表现出优于现有最先进方法的性能，实现了精确和鲁棒的人-物交互重建改进。

Conclusion: ScoreHOI通过引入扩散先验和物理约束，显著提升了人-物交互重建的准确性和物理合理性，为理解人-环境复杂相互关系提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Joint reconstruction of human-object interaction marks a significant
milestone in comprehending the intricate interrelations between humans and
their surrounding environment. Nevertheless, previous optimization methods
often struggle to achieve physically plausible reconstruction results due to
the lack of prior knowledge about human-object interactions. In this paper, we
introduce ScoreHOI, an effective diffusion-based optimizer that introduces
diffusion priors for the precise recovery of human-object interactions. By
harnessing the controllability within score-guided sampling, the diffusion
model can reconstruct a conditional distribution of human and object pose given
the image observation and object feature. During inference, the ScoreHOI
effectively improves the reconstruction results by guiding the denoising
process with specific physical constraints. Furthermore, we propose a
contact-driven iterative refinement approach to enhance the contact
plausibility and improve the reconstruction accuracy. Extensive evaluations on
standard benchmarks demonstrate ScoreHOI's superior performance over
state-of-the-art methods, highlighting its ability to achieve a precise and
robust improvement in joint human-object interaction reconstruction.

Conclusion: ToothMCL是首个多模态预训练框架，通过多模态对比学习有效提升了牙齿分割的准确性咈普适性，为数字牙科提供了可靠的技术支撑

Abstract: Digital dentistry represents a transformative shift in modern dental
practice. The foundational step in this transformation is the accurate digital
representation of the patient's dentition, which is obtained from segmented
Cone-Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) and Intraoral Scans (IOS). Despite the
growing interest in digital dental technologies, existing segmentation
methodologies frequently lack rigorous validation and demonstrate limited
performance and clinical applicability. To the best of our knowledge, this is
the first work to introduce a multimodal pretraining framework for tooth
segmentation. We present ToothMCL, a Tooth Multimodal Contrastive Learning for
pretraining that integrates volumetric (CBCT) and surface-based (IOS)
modalities. By capturing modality-invariant representations through multimodal
contrastive learning, our approach effectively models fine-grained anatomical
features, enabling precise multi-class segmentation and accurate identification
of F\'ed\'eration Dentaire Internationale (FDI) tooth numbering. Along with the
framework, we curated CBCT-IOS3.8K, the largest paired CBCT and IOS dataset to
date, comprising 3,867 patients. We then evaluated ToothMCL on a comprehensive
collection of independent datasets, representing the largest and most diverse
evaluation to date. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in both
internal and external testing, with an increase of 12\% for CBCT segmentation
and 8\% for IOS segmentation in the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC).
Furthermore, ToothMCL consistently surpasses existing approaches in tooth
groups and demonstrates robust generalizability across varying imaging
conditions and clinical scenarios.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种两次递归适应性推理算法，解决消费级硬件上对象检测的系统级性能瓶颈问题，在RTX 4060智能本上实现1.85倍速度提升，仅付出5.51% mAP损失的代价。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前本地AI在消费级硬件上存在严重性能间隔，高端GPU的性能指标在资源受限系统上无法实现，性能主要受到系统级瓶颈限制。

Method: 提出两次递归适应性推理算法，无需模型架构改动。首先使用快速低分辨率通道，仅当检测信心度低时才升级到高分辨率模型通道。对比分析了架构早期退出和分辨率适应路由策略。

Result: 在COCO 5000张图片数据集上，该方法较PyTorch早期退出基准实现了1.85倍速度提升，mAP仅下降5.51%。在RTX 4060智能本上验证了实际性能改善。

Conclusion: 该研究为消费级设备部署高性能实时AI提供了可实现的蓝图，通过从纯粹模型优化转向硬件感知的推理策略，最大化系统吞吐量，解决了实际部署中的性能瓶颈问题。

Abstract: As local AI grows in popularity, there is a critical gap between the
benchmark performance of object detectors and their practical viability on
consumer-grade hardware. While models like YOLOv10s promise real-time speeds,
these metrics are typically achieved on high-power, desktop-class GPUs. This
paper reveals that on resource-constrained systems, such as laptops with RTX
4060 GPUs, performance is not compute-bound but is instead dominated by
system-level bottlenecks, as illustrated by a simple bottleneck test. To
overcome this hardware-level constraint, we introduce a Two-Pass Adaptive
Inference algorithm, a model-independent approach that requires no
architectural changes. This study mainly focuses on adaptive inference
strategies and undertakes a comparative analysis of architectural early-exit
and resolution-adaptive routing, highlighting their respective trade-offs
within a unified evaluation framework. The system uses a fast, low-resolution
pass and only escalates to a high-resolution model pass when detection
confidence is low. On a 5000-image COCO dataset, our method achieves a 1.85x
speedup over a PyTorch Early-Exit baseline, with a modest mAP loss of 5.51%.
This work provides a practical and reproducible blueprint for deploying
high-performance, real-time AI on consumer-grade devices by shifting the focus
from pure model optimization to hardware-aware inference strategies that
maximize throughput.

Motivation: 为了支持在轨服务和活性岞埃清理任务中对不合作太空物体的形状和运动特性进行准确评估，需要有效重建漂浮目标的3D模型。

Method: 使用Isaac Sim模拟环境生成物理准确的2D图像序列，并采用Neuralangelo算法进行静态场景的3D重建，通过Cloud Compare工具进行模型对比评估。

Conclusion: 研究为动态场景重建的进一步评估提供了基准，静态场景下的成功重建表明该方法在太空物体3D重建方面具有潜力。

Abstract: Characterization of uncooperative Resident Space Objects (RSO) play a crucial
role in On-Orbit Servicing (OOS) and Active Debris Removal (ADR) missions to
assess the geometry and motion properties. To address the challenges of
reconstructing tumbling uncooperative targets, this study evaluates the
performance of existing state-of-the-art 3D reconstruction algorithms for
dynamic scenes, focusing on their ability to generate geometrically accurate
models with high-fidelity. To support our evaluation, we developed a simulation
environment using Isaac Sim to generate physics-accurate 2D image sequences of
tumbling satellite under realistic orbital lighting conditions. Our preliminary
results on static scenes using Neuralangelo demonstrate promising
reconstruction quality. The generated 3D meshes closely match the original CAD
models with minimal errors and artifacts when compared using Cloud Compare
(CC). The reconstructed models were able to capture critical fine details for
mission planning. This provides a baseline for our ongoing evaluation of
dynamic scene reconstruction.

Motivation: 解决深度神经网络特征提取过程的黑盒性问题，分析DNN特征空间的内部编码机制。

Method: 使用导向潜移模型实现解码器，在图像生成过程中最小化清浅图像特征与用户指定特征的欧几里得距离。

Result: 生成的图像特征与指定特征显著相似，揭示了CLIP、ResNet-50和ViT等DNN特征空间的价值见解。

Conclusion: 该方法无需额外训练即可分析不同DNN的特征空间，为理解神经网络内部表征提供了新视角。

Abstract: One of the key issues in Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) is the black-box nature
of their internal feature extraction process. Targeting vision-related domains,
this paper focuses on analysing the feature space of a DNN by proposing a
decoder that can generate images whose features are guaranteed to closely match
a user-specified feature. Owing to this guarantee that is missed in past
studies, our decoder allows us to evidence which of various attributes in an
image are encoded into a feature by the DNN, by generating images whose
features are in proximity to that feature. Our decoder is implemented as a
guided diffusion model that guides the reverse image generation of a
pre-trained diffusion model to minimise the Euclidean distance between the
feature of a clean image estimated at each step and the user-specified feature.
One practical advantage of our decoder is that it can analyse feature spaces of
different DNNs with no additional training and run on a single COTS GPU. The
experimental results targeting CLIP's image encoder, ResNet-50 and vision
transformer demonstrate that images generated by our decoder have features
remarkably similar to the user-specified ones and reveal valuable insights into
these DNNs' feature spaces.

TL;DR: OnePoseViaGen是一个用于单张参考图像估计任意未见物体6D姿态的先进方法，通过粗到精对齐模块和文本引导生成域随机化策略，在多个基准测试中达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决机器人操作中从单张参考图像估计任意未见物体6D姿态的挑战性问题，包括3D模型稀缺、单视图重建缺乏度量尺度以及生成模型与真实图像之间的域差距。

Method: 提出两个关键组件：1）粗到精对齐模块，通过多视图特征匹配和渲染-比较细化联合优化尺度和姿态；2）文本引导生成域随机化策略，多样化纹理以有效微调姿态估计器。

Result: 在YCBInEOAT、Toyota-Light、LM-O等挑战性基准测试中达到最先进性能，远超先前方法，并在真实机器人手上展示了稳健的灵巧抓取能力。

Conclusion: 该方法通过高保真单视图3D生成支持可靠的单次6D姿态估计，验证了在实际操作中的实用性，为机器人处理现实世界长尾实例提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Estimating the 6D pose of arbitrary unseen objects from a single reference
image is critical for robotics operating in the long-tail of real-world
instances. However, this setting is notoriously challenging: 3D models are
rarely available, single-view reconstructions lack metric scale, and domain
gaps between generated models and real-world images undermine robustness. We
propose OnePoseViaGen, a pipeline that tackles these challenges through two key
components. First, a coarse-to-fine alignment module jointly refines scale and
pose by combining multi-view feature matching with render-and-compare
refinement. Second, a text-guided generative domain randomization strategy
diversifies textures, enabling effective fine-tuning of pose estimators with
synthetic data. Together, these steps allow high-fidelity single-view 3D
generation to support reliable one-shot 6D pose estimation. On challenging
benchmarks (YCBInEOAT, Toyota-Light, LM-O), OnePoseViaGen achieves
state-of-the-art performance far surpassing prior approaches. We further
demonstrate robust dexterous grasping with a real robot hand, validating the
practicality of our method in real-world manipulation. Project page:

TL;DR: VIRAL是一种通过视觉表示对齐来增强多模态大语言模型视觉推理能力的正则化策略，通过在训练中对齐MLLM与预训练视觉基础模型的内部视觉表示，保留关键视觉细节并补充额外视觉知识


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态大语言模型在视觉中心任务（如目标计数、空间推理）上表现有限，主要原因是文本监督范式只能提供视觉通路的间接指导，导致模型在训练中丢弃细粒度视觉细节

Method: 提出VIRAL框架，通过正则化策略显式对齐MLLM与预训练视觉基础模型的内部视觉表示，使模型既能保留输入视觉编码器的关键视觉细节，又能从VFMs补充额外视觉知识

Result: 实验表明在广泛采用的多模态基准测试的所有任务上都取得了持续改进，并通过全面的消融研究验证了关键设计选择

Conclusion: 这一简单发现为在训练MLLMs中有效整合视觉信息开辟了重要方向

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) trained with visual instruction
tuning have achieved strong performance across diverse tasks, yet they remain
limited in vision-centric tasks such as object counting or spatial reasoning.
We attribute this gap to the prevailing text-only supervision paradigm, which
provides only indirect guidance for the visual pathway and often leads MLLMs to
discard fine-grained visual details during training. In this paper, we present
VIsual Representation ALignment (VIRAL), a simple yet effective regularization
strategy that aligns the internal visual representations of MLLMs with those of
pre-trained vision foundation models (VFMs). By explicitly enforcing this
alignment, VIRAL enables the model not only to retain critical visual details
from the input vision encoder but also to complement additional visual
knowledge from VFMs, thereby enhancing its ability to reason over complex
visual inputs. Our experiments demonstrate consistent improvements across all
tasks on widely adopted multimodal benchmarks. Furthermore, we conduct
comprehensive ablation studies to validate the key design choices underlying
our framework. We believe this simple finding opens up an important direction
for the effective integration of visual information in training MLLMs.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show increasing potential in education, yet
benchmarks for non-English languages in specialized domains remain scarce. We
introduce MedBench-IT, the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating LLMs on

focusing on practical deployability.
  Beyond accuracy, we conducted rigorous reproducibility tests (88.86% response
consistency, varying by subject), ordering bias analysis (minimal impact), and
reasoning prompt evaluation. We also examined correlations between question
readability and model performance, finding a statistically significant but
small inverse relationship. MedBench-IT provides a crucial resource for Italian

Motivation: 现有多模态任务型对话系统忽视了非结构化评论知识的使用，并且没有充分利用大语言模型的潜力。论文主张通过合理利用双重知识来提升文本响应生成的质量。

Method: 提出DK2R模型：1、从外部知识库提取结构化属性和非结构化评论知识；2、使用LLM分析每种知识类型的有用性；3、通过专门的理由分析分离意图和响应，作为辅助信号增强文本生成。

Conclusion: DK2R通过合理利用双重知识类型和大语言模型，有效解决了多模态任务型对话中的动态知识选择和意图-响应解耦挑战，显著提升了文本响应生成的质量。

Abstract: Textual response generation is pivotal for multimodal \mbox{task-oriented}
dialog systems, which aims to generate proper textual responses based on the
multimodal context. While existing efforts have demonstrated remarkable
progress, there still exist the following limitations: 1) \textit{neglect of
unstructured review knowledge} and 2) \textit{underutilization of large
language models (LLMs)}. Inspired by this, we aim to fully utilize dual
knowledge (\textit{i.e., } structured attribute and unstructured review
knowledge) with LLMs to promote textual response generation in multimodal
task-oriented dialog systems. However, this task is non-trivial due to two key
challenges: 1) \textit{dynamic knowledge type selection} and 2)
\textit{intention-response decoupling}. To address these challenges, we propose
a novel dual knowledge-enhanced two-stage reasoner by adapting LLMs for
multimodal dialog systems (named DK2R). To be specific, DK2R first extracts
both structured attribute and unstructured review knowledge from external
knowledge base given the dialog context. Thereafter, DK2R uses an LLM to
evaluate each knowledge type's utility by analyzing LLM-generated provisional
probe responses. Moreover, DK2R separately summarizes the intention-oriented
key clues via dedicated reasoning, which are further used as auxiliary signals
to enhance LLM-based textual response generation. Extensive experiments
conducted on a public dataset verify the superiority of DK2R. We have released
the codes and parameters.

Abstract: This study presents a framework for automated evaluation of dynamically
evolving topic models using Large Language Models (LLMs). Topic modeling is
essential for organizing and retrieving scholarly content in digital library
systems, helping users navigate complex and evolving knowledge domains.
However, widely used automated metrics, such as coherence and diversity, often
capture only narrow statistical patterns and fail to explain semantic failures
in practice. We introduce a purpose-oriented evaluation framework that employs
nine LLM-based metrics spanning four key dimensions of topic quality: lexical
validity, intra-topic semantic soundness, inter-topic structural soundness, and
document-topic alignment soundness. The framework is validated through
adversarial and sampling-based protocols, and is applied across datasets
spanning news articles, scholarly publications, and social media posts, as well
as multiple topic modeling methods and open-source LLMs. Our analysis shows
that LLM-based metrics provide interpretable, robust, and task-relevant
assessments, uncovering critical weaknesses in topic models such as redundancy
and semantic drift, which are often missed by traditional metrics. These
results support the development of scalable, fine-grained evaluation tools for
maintaining topic relevance in dynamic datasets. All code and data supporting

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 出院沟通是患者护理中关键但未被充分研究的环节，现有的大语言模型基准主要关注诊断推理，而忽略了评估模型在就诊后支持患者的能力。

Method: DischargeSim模拟就诊后的多轮对话，使用LLM驱动的医生代理与具有不同心理社会特征的患者代理进行交互，通过自动评估、LLM作为评判者、个性化文档生成和患者理解测试三个维度进行评估。

Result: 对18个大语言模型的实验显示，在出院教育能力方面存在显著差距，性能因患者特征而异，模型大小并不总是带来更好的教育效果。

Conclusion: DischargeSim为评估大语言模型在就诊后临床教育中的表现提供了首个基准，有助于促进公平、个性化的患者支持。

Abstract: Discharge communication is a critical yet underexplored component of patient
care, where the goal shifts from diagnosis to education. While recent large
language model (LLM) benchmarks emphasize in-visit diagnostic reasoning, they
fail to evaluate models' ability to support patients after the visit. We
introduce DischargeSim, a novel benchmark that evaluates LLMs on their ability
to act as personalized discharge educators. DischargeSim simulates post-visit,
multi-turn conversations between LLM-driven DoctorAgents and PatientAgents with
diverse psychosocial profiles (e.g., health literacy, education, emotion).
Interactions are structured across six clinically grounded discharge topics and
assessed along three axes: (1) dialogue quality via automatic and LLM-as-judge
evaluation, (2) personalized document generation including free-text summaries
and structured AHRQ checklists, and (3) patient comprehension through a
downstream multiple-choice exam. Experiments across 18 LLMs reveal significant
gaps in discharge education capability, with performance varying widely across
patient profiles. Notably, model size does not always yield better education
outcomes, highlighting trade-offs in strategy use and content prioritization.
DischargeSim offers a first step toward benchmarking LLMs in post-visit
clinical education and promoting equitable, personalized patient support.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 基于道德原则的框架，通过规则引擎处理LLM不确定性，提供透明的说明和理由


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 概率方法不透明且与透明性期望不一致，需要在高风险场景中提供可解释的不确定性处理方案

Method: 基于道德心理学和美德伦理学，定义预防、尊重、责任等规则，在Prolog引擎中编码，根据不确定性级别触发对应行动

Result: 场景模拟评估显示规则覆盖度、公平性和信任检验，临床和法律应用案例证明道德推理能提升信任和可解释性

Conclusion: 该方法为社会责任职责的自然语言生成提供了透明、轻量级的替代方案，避免概率模型的不透明性

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in high-stakes settings,
where explaining uncertainty is both technical and ethical. Probabilistic
methods are often opaque and misaligned with expectations of transparency. We
propose a framework based on rule-based moral principles for handling
uncertainty in LLM-generated text. Using insights from moral psychology and
virtue ethics, we define rules such as precaution, deference, and
responsibility to guide responses under epistemic or aleatoric uncertainty.
These rules are encoded in a lightweight Prolog engine, where uncertainty
levels (low, medium, high) trigger aligned system actions with plain-language
rationales. Scenario-based simulations benchmark rule coverage, fairness, and
trust calibration. Use cases in clinical and legal domains illustrate how moral
reasoning can improve trust and interpretability. Our approach offers a
transparent, lightweight alternative to probabilistic models for socially
responsible natural language generation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文使用大语言模型自动注释德国议会辩论中的(反)团结子类型，评估了多个LLM模型的表现，并揭示了德国战后时期和近期对移民的团结与反团结趋势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统手动注释方法限制了政治文本分析的规模，需要自动化处理复杂的注释任务以深入研究德国议会中关于移民问题的(反)团结言论。

Method: 使用多个大语言模型(LLMs)自动注释德国议会辩论中的(反)团结子类型，与数千个人工注释进行对比评估，分析了模型规模、提示方式、微调、历史与现代数据差异等因素的影响。

Result: 研究发现德国战后时期对移民展现出高度团结，而自2015年以来议会中出现了强烈的反团结趋势，为进一步研究提供了动力。

Conclusion: 大语言模型在政治文本分析中具有广阔前景，德国移民辩论在人口衰退和劳动力短缺的背景下日趋两极化，具有重要意义。

Abstract: Migration has been a core topic in German political debate, from millions of
expellees post World War II over labor migration to refugee movements in the
recent past. Studying political speech regarding such wide-ranging phenomena in
depth traditionally required extensive manual annotations, limiting the scope
of analysis to small subsets of the data. Large language models (LLMs) have the
potential to partially automate even complex annotation tasks. We provide an
extensive evaluation of a multiple LLMs in annotating (anti-)solidarity
subtypes in German parliamentary debates compared to a large set of thousands
of human reference annotations (gathered over a year). We evaluate the
influence of model size, prompting differences, fine-tuning, historical versus
contemporary data; and we investigate systematic errors. Beyond methodological
evaluation, we also interpret the resulting annotations from a social science
lense, gaining deeper insight into (anti-)solidarity trends towards migrants in
the German post-World War II period and recent past. Our data reveals a high
degree of migrant-directed solidarity in the postwar period, as well as a
strong trend towards anti-solidarity in the German parliament since 2015,
motivating further research. These findings highlight the promise of LLMs for
political text analysis and the importance of migration debates in Germany,
where demographic decline and labor shortages coexist with rising polarization.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CASTLE是一种新型的注意力机制，通过动态更新每个token的key来整合后续信息，同时保持自回归特性，在语言建模任务上表现优于标准因果注意力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准因果注意力中每个token的QKV是静态的，只能编码前文信息，限制了模型对完整上下文的利用能力。

Method: 提出CASTLE机制，持续更新每个token的key（称为lookahead keys），让较早位置的token能够整合后续位置的信息，同时保持自回归特性。通过数学等价性实现并行训练。

Result: 在语言建模基准测试中，CASTLE在不同规模的模型上都优于标准因果注意力，降低了验证困惑度，并在多个下游任务上表现更好。

Conclusion: CASTLE通过动态更新key的方式有效提升了注意力机制的性能，为自回归模型提供了更好的上下文整合能力。

Abstract: In standard causal attention, each token's query, key, and value (QKV) are
static and encode only preceding context. We introduce CAuSal aTtention with
Lookahead kEys (CASTLE), an attention mechanism that continually updates each
token's keys as the context unfolds. We term these updated keys lookahead keys
because they belong to earlier positions yet integrate information from tokens
that appear later relative to those positions, while strictly preserving the
autoregressive property. Although the mechanism appears sequential, we derive a
mathematical equivalence that avoids explicitly materializing lookahead keys at
each position and enables efficient parallel training. On language modeling
benchmarks, CASTLE consistently outperforms standard causal attention across
model scales, reducing validation perplexity and improving performance on a
range of downstream tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 测试BVM方法在判断图像状态变化方面的能力，特别是通过语言嵌入来分类名词状态和区分形容词

Method: 使用MIT-States数据集（53,000张图像，225个名词和115个形容词），通过BVM方法与余弦相似度、点积、乘积量化、二进制索引、朴素贝叶斯和自定义神经网络进行比较

Result: BVM在名词状态分类方面表现最佳，但在形容词区分方面不如逻辑回归模型，但发现了可能的改进方法

Conclusion: BVM在名词状态分类方面有效，但在形容词区分方面需要进一步改进，存在提升准确性的潜力

Abstract: We test a new method, which we will abbreviate using the acronym BVM (Basis
Vectors Method), in its ability to judge the state changes in images through
using language embeddings. We used the MIT-States dataset, containing about
53,000 images, to gather all of our data, which has 225 nouns and 115
adjectives, with each noun having about 9 different adjectives, forming
approximately 1000 noun-adjective pairs. For our first experiment, we test our
method's ability to determine the state of each noun class separately against
other metrics for comparison. These metrics are cosine similarity, dot product,
product quantization, binary index, Naive Bayes, and a custom neural network.
Among these metrics, we found that our proposed BVM performs the best in
classifying the states for each noun. We then perform a second experiment where
we try using BVM to determine if it can differentiate adjectives from one
another for each adjective separately. We compared the abilities of BVM to
differentiate adjectives against the proposed method the MIT-States paper
suggests: using a logistic regression model. In the end, we did not find
conclusive evidence that our BVM metric could perform better than the logistic
regression model at discerning adjectives. Yet, we were able to find evidence
for possible improvements to our method; this leads to the chance of increasing
our method's accuracy through certain changes in our methodologies.

Motivation: 为长文本生成任务建立一个任务、模型和评估指标无关的性能预测基准，支持多维度质量评估指标的黑盒预测。

Method: 使用仅供给黑盒模型输入输出的方式，预测连续的评估指标分数，并推断预测区间以量化不确定性。基于16个训练示例即可有效预测。

Result: 在11个长文本数据集/任务上进行评估，涵盖多个大语言模型、基线方法和评估指标，证明了在各种长文本生成任务个性能预测的有效性。

Conclusion: 该研究提出了一个新题、有价值的基准平台和可立即应用的基线方法，为长文本生成性能预测领域推动了进步。

Abstract: We motivate and share a new benchmark for instance-level performance
prediction of long-form generation tasks having multi-faceted, fine-grained
quality metrics. Our task-, model- and metric-agnostic formulation predicts
continuous evaluation metric scores given only black-box model inputs and
outputs. Beyond predicting point estimates of metric scores, the benchmark also
requires inferring prediction intervals to quantify uncertainty around point
estimates. Evaluation spans 11 long-form datasets/tasks with multiple LLMs,
baselines, and metrics per task. We show that scores can be effectively
predicted across long-form generation tasks using as few as 16 training
examples. Overall, we introduce a novel and useful task, a valuable benchmark
to drive progress, and baselines ready for practical adoption today.

TL;DR: 提出了KAMIR方法，通过分析模型内部表示来选择监督微调数据，避免提示工程依赖，适用于多种任务类型


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前SFT训练数据选择缺乏明确方法，基于知识的选择方法依赖提示工程且成本高，需要更高效的数据选择方案

Method: KAMIR方法通过计算每层隐藏状态与最终隐藏状态的相似度来评估数据，基于模型对输入的熟悉程度选择训练数据

Result: 实验表明，使用不太熟悉的数据进行训练能获得更好的泛化性能，方法适用于机器阅读理解、摘要等多种任务

Conclusion: KAMIR提供了一种有效的数据选择方法，不依赖提示工程，能在小数据集和简单分类器架构下实现良好性能

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have been driven by
pretraining, supervised fine tuning (SFT), and alignment tuning. Among these,
SFT plays a crucial role in transforming a model 's general knowledge into
structured responses tailored to specific tasks. However, there is no clearly
established methodology for effective training data selection. Simply
increasing the volume of data does not guarantee performance improvements,
while preprocessing, sampling, and validation require substantial time and
cost.
  To address this issue, a variety of data selection methods have been
proposed. Among them, knowledge based selection approaches identify suitable
training data by analyzing the model 's responses. Nevertheless, these methods
typically rely on prompt engineering, making them sensitive to variations and
incurring additional costs for prompt design.
  In this study, we propose Knowledge Analysis via Model Internal
Representations (KAMIR), a novel approach that overcomes these limitations by
analyzing data based on the model 's internal representations. KAMIR computes
similarities between the hidden states of each layer (block) and the final
hidden states for a given input to assess the data. Unlike prior methods that
were largely limited to multiple choice tasks, KAMIR can be applied to a wide
range of tasks such as machine reading comprehension and summarization.
Moreover, it selects data useful for training based on the model 's familiarity
with the input, even with a small dataset and a simple classifier architecture.
Experiments across diverse task datasets demonstrate that training with less
familiar data leads to better generalization performance.

Motivation: 传转器自注意力机制存在局部化问题，关注点容易冲击在少数token上，无法有效捐捕长距离依赖关系

Method: 提出SAOBP精细框架，通过信仰传播过程注入多跳关系，并引入GTD指标来量化多跳连接的相对贡献

Result: SAOBP能够防止深层熵的熵提冲击，适应性维持GTD在任务适当水平，尤其在小规模模型中实现竞争性性能提升

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了自注意力局部化问题，特别适用于资源受限场景下推理质量的改善，为小规模模型的性能优化提供了新的解决方案

Abstract: Transformer-based self-attention mechanism serves as the core of modern
language models, yet it often suffers from localization, where attentions
collapse onto a limited subset of tokens and fail to capture long-range
dependencies. To address this issue, we propose Self-Attention One-step Belief
Propagation (SAOBP), a refinement framework that injects multi-hop
relationships through a belief propagation process. To interpret and quantify
these interactions, we introduce Global Token Dependency (GTD) that captures
the relative contribution of multihop connections within the attention graph.
Empirical results indicate that SAOBP helps prevent entropy collapse in deeper
layers and adaptively maintains GTD at task-appropriate levels, thereby
supporting improvements in model performance. Importantly, we observe
competitive gains in small-scale models, highlighting its potential for
improving inference quality in resource-constrained scenarios.

Motivation: 解决科学领域实体识别任务中LLM微调成本高的问题，寻求性能与成本的最佳平衡

Method: 提出三阶段主动学习框架，使用三种不同的主动学习策略选择最具信息量和代表性的样本，构建真实检索语料库用于LLM上下文学习

Result: 在三个专业领域数据集上，ALLabel在相同标注预算下始终优于所有基线方法，仅标注5%-10%的数据即可达到全数据集标注的性能

Conclusion: ALLabel框架有效且具有通用性，能够显著降低LLM实体识别的标注成本同时保持高性能

Abstract: Many contemporary data-driven research efforts in the natural sciences, such
as chemistry and materials science, require large-scale, high-performance
entity recognition from scientific datasets. Large language models (LLMs) have
increasingly been adopted to solve the entity recognition task, with the same
trend being observed on all-spectrum NLP tasks. The prevailing entity
recognition LLMs rely on fine-tuned technology, yet the fine-tuning process
often incurs significant cost. To achieve a best performance-cost trade-off, we
propose ALLabel, a three-stage framework designed to select the most
informative and representative samples in preparing the demonstrations for LLM
modeling. The annotated examples are used to construct a ground-truth retrieval
corpus for LLM in-context learning. By sequentially employing three distinct
active learning strategies, ALLabel consistently outperforms all baselines
under the same annotation budget across three specialized domain datasets.
Experimental results also demonstrate that selectively annotating only 5\%-10\%
of the dataset with ALLabel can achieve performance comparable to the method
annotating the entire dataset. Further analyses and ablation studies verify the
effectiveness and generalizability of our proposal.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在现实对话中表现出情感感知和社交能力的局限性，无法根据不同的社交和任务情境调整沟通风格和情感表达。

Method: 基于特质激活理论和大五人格模型，采用混合专家架构，结合人格适配器和动态路由网络，实现情境化特质表达。

Result: 在社交情感智能多个维度上显著优于基线模型，在下游人本应用（如心理健康咨询和客户服务）中表现一致提升，人类偏好评估显示与领先LLM竞争性响应质量。

Conclusion: PersonaFuse提供了一个理论基础扎实且实用的方法，用于开发社交情感增强的LLM，标志着向更人本AI系统的重要进展。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable
capabilities across various fields. These developments have led to more direct
communication between humans and LLMs in various situations, such as social
companionship and psychological support. However, LLMs often exhibit
limitations in emotional perception and social competence during real-world
conversations. These limitations partly originate from their inability to adapt
their communication style and emotional expression to different social and task
contexts. In this work, we introduce PersonaFuse, a novel LLM post-training
framework that enables LLMs to adapt and express different personalities for
varying situations. Inspired by Trait Activation Theory and the Big Five
personality model, PersonaFuse employs a Mixture-of-Expert architecture that
combines persona adapters with a dynamic routing network, enabling contextual
trait expression. Experimental results show that PersonaFuse substantially
outperforms baseline models across multiple dimensions of social-emotional
intelligence. Importantly, these gains are achieved without sacrificing general
reasoning ability or model safety, which remain common limitations of direct
prompting and supervised fine-tuning approaches. PersonaFuse also delivers
consistent improvements in downstream human-centered applications, such as
mental health counseling and review-based customer service. Finally, human
preference evaluations against leading LLMs, including GPT-4o and DeepSeek,
demonstrate that PersonaFuse achieves competitive response quality despite its
comparatively smaller model size. These findings demonstrate that
PersonaFuse~offers a theoretically grounded and practical approach for
developing social-emotional enhanced LLMs, marking a significant advancement
toward more human-centric AI systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MoLoRAG是一个逻辑感知的检索框架，通过构建页面图来捕获页面间的上下文关系，结合语义和逻辑相关性进行多模态多页文档理解，显著提升了文档问答的准确性和检索精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法将文档转换为文本处理会丢失多模态信息（如图表），而大型视觉语言模型（LVLMs）受限于输入长度无法处理多页文档。现有的检索增强生成（RAG）方法仅依赖语义相关性，忽略了页面间的逻辑连接，这对于推理至关重要。

Method: 构建页面图捕获页面间上下文关系，使用轻量级VLM进行图遍历检索相关页面（包括常被忽略的逻辑连接页面）。提供两种变体：无需训练的解决方案和微调版本以改进逻辑相关性检查。检索后，将top-K页面输入任意LVLM进行问答。

Result: 在四个DocQA数据集上的实验显示，相比LVLM直接推理平均准确率提升9.68%，相比基线方法检索精度提升7.44%。

Conclusion: MoLoRAG通过结合语义和逻辑相关性，有效解决了多模态多页文档理解中的检索问题，显著提升了文档问答性能，并提供了灵活部署的解决方案。

Abstract: Document Understanding is a foundational AI capability with broad
applications, and Document Question Answering (DocQA) is a key evaluation task.
Traditional methods convert the document into text for processing by Large
Language Models (LLMs), but this process strips away critical multi-modal
information like figures. While Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) address
this limitation, their constrained input size makes multi-page document
comprehension infeasible. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods mitigate
this by selecting relevant pages, but they rely solely on semantic relevance,
ignoring logical connections between pages and the query, which is essential
for reasoning.
  To this end, we propose MoLoRAG, a logic-aware retrieval framework for
multi-modal, multi-page document understanding. By constructing a page graph
that captures contextual relationships between pages, a lightweight VLM
performs graph traversal to retrieve relevant pages, including those with
logical connections often overlooked. This approach combines semantic and
logical relevance to deliver more accurate retrieval. After retrieval, the
top-$K$ pages are fed into arbitrary LVLMs for question answering. To enhance
flexibility, MoLoRAG offers two variants: a training-free solution for easy
deployment and a fine-tuned version to improve logical relevance checking.
Experiments on four DocQA datasets demonstrate average improvements of 9.68% in
accuracy over LVLM direct inference and 7.44% in retrieval precision over
baselines. Codes and datasets are released at
https://github.com/WxxShirley/MoLoRAG.

Motivation: 评估大语言模型是否能像人类一样通过模式识别和交互反馈学习语言，这是人类语言获得的核心特征

Method: 构建新语言Tinkatongue，让LLM代理与只理解该语言的机器人对话，评估其语言获得能力

Result: LLM代理在100次回应内无法成功建立对话，但显示出类似人类语言学习的策略

Conclusion: 需要新的评测标准和模型设计方向，以更有效地从交互反馈中学习

Abstract: Existing evaluation studies on linguistic competence of large language models
(LLM agents) have focused primarily on vocabulary learning, morphological rule
induction, syntactic generalization, pragmatic inference, and cross-linguistic
transfer. However, none assess whether LLM agents can acquire a language
through pattern recognition and interactive feedback, a central feature of
human language acquisition. We propose a novel experimental framework in which
an LLM agent is evaluated on its ability to acquire and use a newly constructed
language (Tinkatongue) in conversation with a bot that understands only
Tinkatongue. Our findings show that LLM agents fail to establish a conversation
within 100 responses, yet they adopt distinct strategies that mirror human
approaches to language learning. The results suggest a new direction for
evaluation benchmarks and open pathways to model designs that learn more
effectively from interactive feedback.

Abstract: Structured information extraction from scientific literature is crucial for
capturing core concepts and emerging trends in specialized fields. While
existing datasets aid model development, most focus on specific publication
sections due to domain complexity and the high cost of annotating scientific
texts. To address this limitation, we introduce SciNLP - a specialized
benchmark for full-text entity and relation extraction in the Natural Language
Processing (NLP) domain. The dataset comprises 60 manually annotated full-text
NLP publications, covering 7,072 entities and 1,826 relations. Compared to
existing research, SciNLP is the first dataset providing full-text annotations
of entities and their relationships in the NLP domain. To validate the
effectiveness of SciNLP, we conducted comparative experiments with similar
datasets and evaluated the performance of state-of-the-art supervised models on
this dataset. Results reveal varying extraction capabilities of existing models
across academic texts of different lengths. Cross-comparisons with existing
datasets show that SciNLP achieves significant performance improvements on
certain baseline models. Using models trained on SciNLP, we implemented
automatic construction of a fine-grained knowledge graph for the NLP domain.
Our KG has an average node degree of 3.2 per entity, indicating rich semantic
topological information that enhances downstream applications. The dataset is

Conclusion: 通过将知识图遍历任务交由专门的轻量模块处理，可以充分发挥小型语言模型的潜力，提高知识图集成方案的可访问性和可扩展性

Abstract: Integrating knowledge graphs (KGs) into the reasoning processes of large
language models (LLMs) has emerged as a promising approach to mitigate
hallucination. However, existing work in this area often relies on proprietary
or extremely large models, limiting accessibility and scalability. In this
study, we investigate the capabilities of existing integration methods for
small language models (SLMs) in KG-based question answering and observe that
their performance is often constrained by their limited ability to traverse and
reason over knowledge graphs. To address this limitation, we propose leveraging
simple and efficient exploration modules to handle knowledge graph traversal in
place of the language model itself. Experiment results demonstrate that these
lightweight modules effectively improve the performance of small language
models on knowledge graph question answering tasks. Source code:

Detection, Emotion QA, Emotion Conversation, Emotion Summary, and Emotion
Expression. On average, the input length for these tasks reaches 8,777 tokens,
with long-form generation required for Emotion Expression. To enhance
performance under realistic constraints, we incorporate Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) and Collaborative Emotional Modeling (CoEM), and compare them
with standard prompt-based methods. Unlike conventional approaches, our RAG
method leverages both the conversation context and the large language model
itself as retrieval sources, avoiding reliance on external knowledge bases. The
CoEM method further improves performance by decomposing the task into five
stages, integrating both retrieval augmentation and limited knowledge
injection. Experimental results show that both RAG and CoEM consistently
enhance EI-related performance across most long-context tasks, advancing LLMs
toward more practical and real-world EI applications. Furthermore, we conducted
a comparative case study experiment on the GPT series to demonstrate the
differences among various models in terms of EI. Code is available on GitHub at

TL;DR: 多语言XLM-RoBERTa-Large模型在德语YouTube评论的糖果语音检测任务中表现最佳，通过span级训练实现了高精度的积极支持性语言识别。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体中的积极支持性沟通（糖果语音）能够促进文明交流，但自动化检测技术尚未充分探索，限制了对其影响的系统性分析。

Method: 使用单语和多语言语言模型（包括GBERT、Qwen3 Embedding和XLM-RoBERTa）在46k条德语YouTube评论语料库中进行糖果语音检测，采用span级训练方法。

Result: 多语言XLM-RoBERTa-Large模型在GermEval 2025共享任务中表现最优，二元阳性F1得分0.8906，分类span检测严格F1得分0.6307。

Conclusion: 研究证明了多语言模型在识别积极支持性语言方面的有效性，span级训练、多语言能力和表情符号感知分词器提升了检测性能。

Abstract: Positive, supportive online communication in social media (candy speech) has
the potential to foster civility, yet automated detection of such language
remains underexplored, limiting systematic analysis of its impact. We
investigate how candy speech can be reliably detected in a 46k-comment German
YouTube corpus by monolingual and multilingual language models, including
GBERT, Qwen3 Embedding, and XLM-RoBERTa. We find that a multilingual
XLM-RoBERTa-Large model trained to detect candy speech at the span level
outperforms other approaches, ranking first in both binary positive F1: 0.8906)
and categorized span-based detection (strict F1: 0.6307) subtasks at the
GermEval 2025 Shared Task on Candy Speech Detection. We speculate that
span-based training, multilingual capabilities, and emoji-aware tokenizers
improved detection performance. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of
multilingual models in identifying positive, supportive language.

TL;DR: 这篇论文通过系统性文献检索识别了医疗健康领域的汉谜语言词典，分析了四个现有词典的相似性和差异，发现大多数汉谜词汇与医生对情感行为的评判表达有关，并呈现负面情感倾向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 汉谜语言导致医疗健康不公平，但目前缺乏统一标准的汉谜语言词典，需要研究现有词典的一致性和差异性。

Method: 进行系统性文献检索识别现有汉谜语言词典，对四个词典进行比较分析：1)语义相似性和差异；2)基于已建情感数据集的正面、负面或中性词汇分布。

Result: 发现四个词典具有中等语义相似性，大多数汉谜词汇与医生对感知到的负面行为的评判表达有关。情感分析显示词汇主要呈现负面分类，但不同词典间存在差异。

Conclusion: 研究结果强调了制定标准化词典的必要性，并提出了在临床文本中定义汉谜语言所面临的挑战。

Abstract: Stigmatizing language results in healthcare inequities, yet there is no
universally accepted or standardized lexicon defining which words, terms, or
phrases constitute stigmatizing language in healthcare. We conducted a
systematic search of the literature to identify existing stigmatizing language
lexicons and then analyzed them comparatively to examine: 1) similarities and
discrepancies between these lexicons, and 2) the distribution of positive,
negative, or neutral terms based on an established sentiment dataset. Our
search identified four lexicons. The analysis results revealed moderate
semantic similarity among them, and that most stigmatizing terms are related to
judgmental expressions by clinicians to describe perceived negative behaviors.
Sentiment analysis showed a predominant proportion of negatively classified
terms, though variations exist across lexicons. Our findings underscore the
need for a standardized lexicon and highlight challenges in defining
stigmatizing language in clinical texts.

Conclusion: HALT-RAG提供了一个灵活可扩展的框架，通过平衡模型性能和安全需求，为RAG管道的安全部署提供了可靠工具。

Abstract: Detecting content that contradicts or is unsupported by a given source text
is a critical challenge for the safe deployment of generative language models.
We introduce HALT-RAG, a post-hoc verification system designed to identify
hallucinations in the outputs of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
pipelines. Our flexible and task-adaptable framework uses a universal feature
set derived from an ensemble of two frozen, off-the-shelf Natural Language
Inference (NLI) models and lightweight lexical signals. These features are used
to train a simple, calibrated, and task-adapted meta-classifier. Using a
rigorous 5-fold out-of-fold (OOF) training protocol to prevent data leakage and
produce unbiased estimates, we evaluate our system on the HaluEval benchmark.
By pairing our universal feature set with a lightweight, task-adapted
classifier and a precision-constrained decision policy, HALT-RAG achieves
strong OOF F1-scores of 0.7756, 0.9786, and 0.7391 on the summarization, QA,
and dialogue tasks, respectively. The system's well-calibrated probabilities
enable a practical abstention mechanism, providing a reliable tool for
balancing model performance with safety requirements.

Method: 采用两阶段学习范式，解耦和利用元知识，在正常条件下自主执行动作，在不可信场景下主动向人类查询

Result: 在不可信场景下比现有最优方法平均步骤成功率提高20.64%，且不影响正常性能表现

Conclusion: VeriOS-Agent展现出良好的合理性、泛化性和可扩展性，为可信操作系统代理的发展提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: With the rapid progress of multimodal large language models, operating system
(OS) agents become increasingly capable of automating tasks through on-device
graphical user interfaces (GUIs). However, most existing OS agents are designed
for idealized settings, whereas real-world environments often present
untrustworthy conditions. To mitigate risks of over-execution in such
scenarios, we propose a query-driven human-agent-GUI interaction framework that
enables OS agents to decide when to query humans for more reliable task
completion. Built upon this framework, we introduce VeriOS-Agent, a trustworthy
OS agent trained with a two-stage learning paradigm that falicitate the
decoupling and utilization of meta-knowledge. Concretely, VeriOS-Agent
autonomously executes actions in normal conditions while proactively querying
humans in untrustworthy scenarios. Experiments show that VeriOS-Agent improves
the average step-wise success rate by 20.64\% in untrustworthy scenarios over
the state-of-the-art, without compromising normal performance. Analysis
highlights VeriOS-Agent's rationality, generalizability, and scalability. The

Motivation: 大语言模型知识快速过时，重新训练成本高，现有检索增强编辑方法在处理多跳问答时存在编辑跳过问题，无法有效利用编辑后的知识

Method: IRAKE方法，通过单编辑事实和完整编辑案例的引导进行迭代检索增强知识编辑，采用引导分解策略解决粒度不匹配问题

Result: 实验结果表明IRAKE有效缓解了编辑跳过导致的编辑失败，在多跳问答知识编辑任务上优于现有最先进方法

Conclusion: IRAKE通过迭代检索和引导分解成功解决了多跳问答中的知识编辑挑战，为大规模语言模型的知识更新提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: In a rapidly evolving world where information updates swiftly, knowledge in
large language models (LLMs) becomes outdated quickly. Retraining LLMs is not a
cost-effective option, making knowledge editing (KE) without modifying
parameters particularly necessary. We find that although existing
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)-based KE methods excel at editing simple
knowledge, they struggle with KE in multi-hop question answering due to the
issue of "edit skipping", which refers to skipping the relevant edited fact in
inference. In addition to the diversity of natural language expressions of
knowledge, edit skipping also arises from the mismatch between the granularity
of LLMs in problem-solving and the facts in the edited memory. To address this
issue, we propose a novel Iterative Retrieval-Augmented Knowledge Editing
method with guided decomposition (IRAKE) through the guidance from single
edited facts and entire edited cases. Experimental results demonstrate that
IRAKE mitigates the failure of editing caused by edit skipping and outperforms
state-of-the-art methods for KE in multi-hop question answering.

Motivation: 现有生物医学LLM对复杂领域特定概念结构和生物医学知识图谱中编码的事实信息理解有限，需要改进对生物医学文本的理解能力。

Method: 提出BALI方法，将文本序列中的生物医学概念提及链接到UMLS知识图谱，利用局部KG子图作为跨模态正样本进行表示对齐学习。

Result: 在PubMedBERT和BioLinkBERT等领先生物医学LM上实施该方法，即使使用PubMed科学摘要的小型对齐数据集进行最小预训练，也能提高语言理解任务性能和实体表示质量。

Conclusion: BALI方法有效增强了生物医学语言模型的知识理解能力，通过知识图谱对齐显著提升了模型在生物医学领域的表现。

Abstract: In recent years, there has been substantial progress in using pretrained
Language Models (LMs) on a range of tasks aimed at improving the understanding
of biomedical texts. Nonetheless, existing biomedical LLMs show limited
comprehension of complex, domain-specific concept structures and the factual
information encoded in biomedical Knowledge Graphs (KGs). In this work, we
propose BALI (Biomedical Knowledge Graph and Language Model Alignment), a novel
joint LM and KG pre-training method that augments an LM with external knowledge
by the simultaneous learning of a dedicated KG encoder and aligning the
representations of both the LM and the graph. For a given textual sequence, we
link biomedical concept mentions to the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS)
KG and utilize local KG subgraphs as cross-modal positive samples for these
mentions. Our empirical findings indicate that implementing our method on
several leading biomedical LMs, such as PubMedBERT and BioLinkBERT, improves
their performance on a range of language understanding tasks and the quality of
entity representations, even with minimal pre-training on a small alignment
dataset sourced from PubMed scientific abstracts.

Motivation: 临床报告通常长繁且包含专业术语，影响医生与患者之间的沟通效果，需要有效摘要技术来提高共享决策质量。

Method: 采用迭代自我提示技术(ISP)，让大语言模型通过少量示例学习生成任务特定提示并精炼。使用ROUGE和BERT-score指标指导模型微调。

Result: 在3,396份多专业临床报告上，使用GPT-4和GPT-4o的视角感知ISP方法获得了ROUGE(46.53, 24.68, 30.77)和BERTscore(87.84, 83.25, 85.46)的高分。高BERTscore表明摘要语义与参考摘要很接近。

Conclusion: 视角感知迭代自我提示技术(PA-ISP)可以有效应用于临床报告摘要，支持更好的医患沟通，虽然词汇层面的重合度较低，但语义等效性很高。

Abstract: Efficient communication between patients and clinicians plays an important
role in shared decision-making. However, clinical reports are often lengthy and
filled with clinical jargon, making it difficult for domain experts to identify
important aspects in the document efficiently. This paper presents the
methodology we applied in the MultiClinSUM shared task for summarising clinical
case documents. We used an Iterative Self-Prompting technique on large language
models (LLMs) by asking LLMs to generate task-specific prompts and refine them
via example-based few-shot learning. Furthermore, we used lexical and embedding
space metrics, ROUGE and BERT-score, to guide the model fine-tuning with
epochs. Our submission using perspective-aware ISP on GPT-4 and GPT-4o achieved
ROUGE scores (46.53, 24.68, 30.77) and BERTscores (87.84, 83.25, 85.46) for (P,
R, F1) from the official evaluation on 3,396 clinical case reports from various
specialties extracted from open journals. The high BERTscore indicates that the
model produced semantically equivalent output summaries compared to the
references, even though the overlap at the exact lexicon level is lower, as
reflected in the lower ROUGE scores. This work sheds some light on how
perspective-aware ISP (PA-ISP) can be deployed for clinical report
summarisation and support better communication between patients and clinicians.

Result: 大量实验证实该框架能够从无标注文本中发现高质量的训练样本，在关系抽取任务上表现出优越性能。

Conclusion: M-BRe框架有效解决了LLMs在关系抽取中的语义理解不足和计算效率问题，为从无标注文本自动构建训练数据提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: For Relation Extraction (RE), the manual annotation of training data may be
prohibitively expensive, since the sentences that contain the target relations
in texts can be very scarce and difficult to find. It is therefore beneficial
to develop an efficient method that can automatically extract training
instances from unlabeled texts for training RE models. Recently, large language
models (LLMs) have been adopted in various natural language processing tasks,
with RE also benefiting from their advances. However, when leveraging LLMs for
RE with predefined relation categories, two key challenges arise. First, in a
multi-class classification setting, LLMs often struggle to comprehensively
capture the semantics of every relation, leading to suboptimal results. Second,
although employing binary classification for each relation individually can
mitigate this issue, it introduces significant computational overhead,
resulting in impractical time complexity for real-world applications.
Therefore, this paper proposes a framework called M-BRe to extract training
instances from unlabeled texts for RE. It utilizes three modules to combine the
advantages of both of the above classification approaches: Relation Grouping,
Relation Extraction, and Label Decision. Extensive experiments confirm its
superior capability in discovering high-quality training samples from unlabeled
texts for RE.

<details>

Motivation: 随着大语言模型在医疗等敏感领域的应用，水印技术的可靠性成为关键问题。现有评测标准过于关注检测质量的权衡，而忽视了在低熵异情况下的事实风险。

Method: 提出了一个医疗领域专门的评估流程，结合评估事实准确性和语訨连贯性。使用GPT-Judger和人工验证，引入了事实性权重分数（FWS）这一综合指标，优先考虑事实准确性而非仅仅是语訨连贯性。

Result: 评估结果显示当前的水印方法在医疗领域对事实性造成了很大弊影，熵异移动会降低医学实体的表达能力。

Conclusion: 这些发现强调了开发领域意识的水印方法的必要性，以保持医疗内容的完整性和可靠性。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) adapted to sensitive domains such as
medicine, their fluency raises safety risks, particularly regarding provenance
and accountability. Watermarking embeds detectable patterns to mitigate these
risks, yet its reliability in medical contexts remains untested. Existing
benchmarks focus on detection-quality tradeoffs, overlooking factual risks
under low-entropy settings often exploited by watermarking's reweighting
strategy. We propose a medical-focused evaluation workflow that jointly
assesses factual accuracy and coherence. Using GPT-Judger and further human
validation, we introduce the Factuality-Weighted Score (FWS), a composite
metric prioritizing factual accuracy beyond coherence to guide watermarking
deployment in medical domains. Our evaluation shows current watermarking
methods substantially compromise medical factuality, with entropy shifts
degrading medical entity representation. These findings underscore the need for
domain-aware watermarking approaches that preserve the integrity of medical
content.

Motivation: 在线平台上虚假新闻、极化内容和有害信息的传播日益严重，但缺乏对大语言模型在不同场景下性能的系统性基准测试。

Method: 使用10个数据集和5种语言（英语、西班牙语、葡萄牙语、阿拉伯语和保加利亚语），测试了参数高效微调和多种上下文学习策略（零样本提示、代码本、少样本学习、思维链等）。

Result: 上下文学习通常表现不如模型微调，即使是较小模型经过任务特定微调后也能超越最大模型的上下文学习性能。

Conclusion: 即使在面对大型模型时，对较小模型进行任务特定的微调仍然是更有效的策略，强调了微调在特定任务场景中的重要性。

Abstract: The spread of fake news, polarizing, politically biased, and harmful content
on online platforms has been a serious concern. With large language models
becoming a promising approach, however, no study has properly benchmarked their
performance across different models, usage methods, and languages. This study
presents a comprehensive overview of different Large Language Models adaptation
paradigms for the detection of hyperpartisan and fake news, harmful tweets, and
political bias. Our experiments spanned 10 datasets and 5 different languages
(English, Spanish, Portuguese, Arabic and Bulgarian), covering both binary and
multiclass classification scenarios. We tested different strategies ranging
from parameter efficient Fine-Tuning of language models to a variety of
different In-Context Learning strategies and prompts. These included zero-shot
prompts, codebooks, few-shot (with both randomly-selected and
diversely-selected examples using Determinantal Point Processes), and
Chain-of-Thought. We discovered that In-Context Learning often underperforms
when compared to Fine-Tuning a model. This main finding highlights the
importance of Fine-Tuning even smaller models on task-specific settings even
when compared to the largest models evaluated in an In-Context Learning setup -
in our case LlaMA3.1-8b-Instruct, Mistral-Nemo-Instruct-2407 and

Abstract: Literary translation has recently gained attention as a distinct and complex
task in machine translation research. However, the translation by small open
models remains an open problem. We contribute to this ongoing research by
introducing TINYFABULIST TRANSLATION FRAMEWORK (TF2), a unified framework for
dataset creation, fine tuning, and evaluation in English-Romanian literary
translations, centred on the creation and open release of both a compact, fine
tuned language model (TF2-12B) and large scale synthetic parallel datasets
(DS-TF2-EN-RO-3M and DS-TF2-EN-RO-15K). Building on DS-TF1-EN-3M (TF1), the
largest collection of synthetic English fables to date, we address the need for
rich, high quality literary datasets in low resource languages such as
Romanian. Our pipeline first generates 15k high quality Romanian references
from the TF1 pool using a high performing LLM. We then apply a two stage fine
tuning process to a 12B parameter open weight model: (i) instruction tuning to
capture genre specific narrative style, and (ii) adapter compression for
efficient deployment. Evaluation combines corpus level BLEU and a five
dimension LLM based rubric (accuracy, fluency, coherence, style, cultural
adaptation) to provide a nuanced assessment of translation quality. Results
show that our fine tuned model achieves fluency and adequacy competitive with
top performing large proprietary models, while being open, accessible, and
significantly more cost effective. Alongside the fine tuned model and both
datasets, we publicly release all scripts and evaluation prompts. TF2 thus
provides an end-to-end, reproducible pipeline for research on cost efficient
translation, cross lingual narrative generation, and the broad adoption of open
models for culturally significant literary content in low resource settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLM输出不稳定性的原因，特别是提示词脆弱性是否是人类标注中已有的不确定性反映，还是LLM特有的问题。

Method: 通过文本分类任务，对LLM和人类标注者使用相同的指令修改，系统比较两者对提示词变化的敏感性。

Result: 人类和LLM都对特定类型的提示词修改（如替代标签集或标签格式）表现出增加的脆弱性，但人类对拼写错误和标签顺序反转的敏感性低于LLM。

Conclusion: 提示词脆弱性在一定程度上反映了人类标注的方差，但LLM对某些提示词修改的敏感性高于人类，这需要进一步研究和改进。

Abstract: The output of large language models (LLM) is unstable, due to both
non-determinism of the decoding process as well as to prompt brittleness. While
the intrinsic non-determinism of LLM generation may mimic existing uncertainty
in human annotations through distributional shifts in outputs, it is largely
assumed, yet unexplored, that the prompt brittleness effect is unique to LLMs.
This raises the question: do human annotators show similar sensitivity to
instruction changes? If so, should prompt brittleness in LLMs be considered
problematic? One may alternatively hypothesize that prompt brittleness
correctly reflects human annotation variances. To fill this research gap, we
systematically compare the effects of prompt modifications on LLMs and
identical instruction modifications for human annotators, focusing on the
question of whether humans are similarly sensitive to prompt perturbations. To
study this, we prompt both humans and LLMs for a set of text classification
tasks conditioned on prompt variations. Our findings indicate that both humans
and LLMs exhibit increased brittleness in response to specific types of prompt
modifications, particularly those involving the substitution of alternative
label sets or label formats. However, the distribution of human judgments is
less affected by typographical errors and reversed label order than that of
LLMs.

Abstract: This paper presents our team's solution to Shared Task 7 of NLPCC-2025, which
focuses on sentence-level gender bias detection and mitigation in Chinese. The
task aims to promote fairness and controllability in natural language
generation by automatically detecting, classifying, and mitigating gender bias.
To address this challenge, we adopt a fine-tuning approach based on large
language models (LLMs), efficiently adapt to the bias detection task via
Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). In terms of data processing, we construct a more
balanced training set to alleviate class imbalance and introduce heterogeneous
samples from multiple sources to enhance model generalization. For the
detection and classification sub-tasks, we employ a majority voting strategy
that integrates outputs from multiple expert models to boost performance.
Additionally, to improve bias generation detection and mitigation, we design a
multi-temperature sampling mechanism to capture potential variations in bias
expression styles. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach in bias detection, classification, and mitigation. Our method
ultimately achieves an average score of 47.90%, ranking fourth in the shared
task.

TL;DR: Biased Tales数据集分析发现LLM生成的故事中存在显著的文化和性别刻板印象：女性主角外貌相关描述增加55.26%，非西方儿童故事过度强调文化传统主题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着家长越来越多地使用大型语言模型生成睡前故事，这些叙事中存在的文化和性别刻板印象问题亟待解决

Method: 创建Biased Tales综合数据集，分析偏见如何影响LLM生成故事中主角属性和故事元素

Result: 发现显著差异：女性主角外貌属性增加55.26%；非西方儿童故事过度强调文化遗产、传统和家庭主题

Conclusion: 研究结果强调了社会文化偏见在使创意AI使用更加公平和多样化方面的重要作用

Abstract: Stories play a pivotal role in human communication, shaping beliefs and
morals, particularly in children. As parents increasingly rely on large
language models (LLMs) to craft bedtime stories, the presence of cultural and
gender stereotypes in these narratives raises significant concerns. To address
this issue, we present Biased Tales, a comprehensive dataset designed to
analyze how biases influence protagonists' attributes and story elements in
LLM-generated stories. Our analysis uncovers striking disparities. When the
protagonist is described as a girl (as compared to a boy), appearance-related
attributes increase by 55.26%. Stories featuring non-Western children
disproportionately emphasize cultural heritage, tradition, and family themes
far more than those for Western children. Our findings highlight the role of
sociocultural bias in making creative AI use more equitable and diverse.

Abstract: Uncertainty estimation is essential for enhancing the reliability of Large
Language Models (LLMs), particularly in high-stakes applications. Existing
methods often overlook semantic dependencies, relying on token-level
probability measures that fail to capture structural relationships within the
generated text. We propose GENUINE: Graph ENhanced mUlti-level uncertaINty
Estimation for Large Language Models, a structure-aware framework that
leverages dependency parse trees and hierarchical graph pooling to refine
uncertainty quantification. By incorporating supervised learning, GENUINE
effectively models semantic and structural relationships, improving confidence
assessments. Extensive experiments across NLP tasks show that GENUINE achieves
up to 29% higher AUROC than semantic entropy-based approaches and reduces
calibration errors by over 15%, demonstrating the effectiveness of graph-based
uncertainty modeling. The code is available at

*Tong Zheng,Hongming Zhang,Wenhao Yu,Xiaoyang Wang,Xinyu Yang,Runpeng Dai,Rui Liu,Huiwen Bao,Chengsong Huang,Heng Huang,Dong Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Parallel-R1是一个强化学习框架，通过渐进式课程训练使大语言模型具备并行思考能力，在数学推理任务上相比顺序思考模型提升8.4%准确率，并可作为训练探索支架带来42.9%的性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要依赖监督微调合成数据，鼓励教师强制模仿而非探索和泛化，难以有效训练并行思考能力。

Method: 提出首个强化学习框架Parallel-R1，采用渐进式课程：先用SFT在简单任务上培养并行思考能力，然后通过RL在困难问题上探索和泛化该技能。

Result: 在MATH、AMC23、AIME等数学基准测试中，Parallel-R1成功培养并行思考能力，比直接RL训练的顺序思考模型准确率提升8.4%。分析显示模型早期使用并行思考进行探索，后期用于多视角验证。

Conclusion: 并行思考可作为中期训练探索支架，这一临时探索阶段能在RL后解锁更高性能上限，在AIME25上比基线提升42.9%。模型、数据和代码将开源。

Abstract: Parallel thinking has emerged as a novel approach for enhancing the reasoning
capabilities of large language models (LLMs) by exploring multiple reasoning
paths concurrently. However, activating such capabilities through training
remains challenging, as existing methods predominantly rely on supervised
fine-tuning (SFT) over synthetic data, which encourages teacher-forced
imitation rather than exploration and generalization. Different from them, we
propose \textbf{Parallel-R1}, the first reinforcement learning (RL) framework
that enables parallel thinking behaviors for complex real-world reasoning
tasks. Our framework employs a progressive curriculum that explicitly addresses
the cold-start problem in training parallel thinking with RL. We first use SFT
on prompt-generated trajectories from easier tasks to instill the parallel
thinking ability, then transition to RL to explore and generalize this skill on
harder problems. Experiments on various math benchmarks, including MATH, AMC23,
and AIME, show that Parallel-R1 successfully instills parallel thinking,
leading to 8.4% accuracy improvements over the sequential thinking model
trained directly on challenging tasks with RL. Further analysis reveals a clear
shift in the model's thinking behavior: at an early stage, it uses parallel
thinking as an exploration strategy, while in a later stage, it uses the same
capability for multi-perspective verification. Most significantly, we validate
parallel thinking as a \textbf{mid-training exploration scaffold}, where this
temporary exploratory phase unlocks a higher performance ceiling after RL,
yielding a 42.9% improvement over the baseline on AIME25. Our model, data, and
code will be open-source at https://github.com/zhengkid/Parallel-R1.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种可解释的个性化两阶段自适应时空模型，用于预测睡眠质量分数，结合多尺度卷积层、循环层和注意力机制，在多个时间窗口设置下均优于基线模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 睡眠质量对健康有重要影响，医疗提供者和个人需要可访问且可靠的预测工具来进行预防性干预。

Method: 使用多尺度卷积层建模空间交互，循环层和注意力机制捕捉长期时间依赖，采用两阶段域适应策略（训练时适应和测试时无源适应）提高泛化能力。

Result: 在5种输入窗口和5种预测窗口设置下均优于LSTM、Informer等基线模型，最佳性能为3天输入窗口和1天预测窗口，RMSE为0.216。

Conclusion: 该框架为使用商业可穿戴设备稀疏数据实现个性化睡眠预测提供了鲁棒、自适应和可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: Sleep quality significantly impacts well-being. Therefore, healthcare
providers and individuals need accessible and reliable forecasting tools for
preventive interventions. This paper introduces an interpretable,
individualized two-stage adaptive spatial-temporal model for predicting sleep
quality scores. Our proposed framework combines multi-scale convolutional
layers to model spatial interactions across multiple input variables, recurrent
layers and attention mechanisms to capture long-term temporal dependencies, and
a two-stage domain adaptation strategy to enhance generalization. The first
adaptation stage is applied during training to mitigate overfitting on the
training set. In the second stage, a source-free test-time adaptation mechanism
is employed to adapt the model to new users without requiring labels. We
conducted various experiments with five input window sizes (3, 5, 7, 9, and 11
days) and five prediction window sizes (1, 3, 5, 7, and 9 days). Our model
consistently outperformed time series forecasting baseline approaches,
including Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Informer, PatchTST, and TimesNet. The
best performance was achieved with a three-day input window and a one-day
prediction window, yielding a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.216.
Furthermore, the model demonstrated good predictive performance even for longer
forecasting horizons (e.g, with a 0.257 RMSE for a three-day prediction
window), highlighting its practical utility for real-world applications. We
also conducted an explainability analysis to examine how different features
influence sleep quality. These findings proved that the proposed framework
offers a robust, adaptive, and explainable solution for personalized sleep
forecasting using sparse data from commercial wearable devices.

TL;DR: GSTBench是首个系统评估图自监督学习方法跨数据集迁移能力的基准测试，发现大多数图SSL方法迁移效果不佳，而GraphMAE方法表现突出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图自监督学习方法主要在单一数据集上开发和评估，其跨数据集迁移能力未被充分探索，限制了知识迁移和大规模预训练的应用，这是发展通用图智能的关键因素。

Method: 在ogbn-papers100M上进行大规模预训练，评估5种代表性SSL方法在多样化目标图上的表现，通过标准化实验设置分离模型架构、数据集特征和适应协议等混杂因素。

Result: 大多数图SSL方法难以泛化，有些甚至比随机初始化效果更差。相比之下，掩码自编码器方法GraphMAE能持续提升迁移性能。

Conclusion: 分析了驱动这些差异的底层因素，为可迁移图SSL的未来研究提供指导，为图学习中的"预训练-迁移"范式奠定坚实基础。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has shown great promise in graph
representation learning. However, most existing graph SSL methods are developed
and evaluated under a single-dataset setting, leaving their cross-dataset
transferability largely unexplored and limiting their ability to leverage
knowledge transfer and large-scale pretraining, factors that are critical for
developing generalized intelligence beyond fitting training data. To address
this gap and advance foundation model research for graphs, we present GSTBench,
the first systematic benchmark for evaluating the transferability of graph SSL
methods. We conduct large-scale pretraining on ogbn-papers100M and evaluate
five representative SSL methods across a diverse set of target graphs. Our
standardized experimental setup decouples confounding factors such as model
architecture, dataset characteristics, and adaptation protocols, enabling
rigorous comparisons focused solely on pretraining objectives. Surprisingly, we
observe that most graph SSL methods struggle to generalize, with some
performing worse than random initialization. In contrast, GraphMAE, a masked
autoencoder approach, consistently improves transfer performance. We analyze
the underlying factors that drive these differences and offer insights to guide
future research on transferable graph SSL, laying a solid foundation for the
"pretrain-then-transfer" paradigm in graph learning. Our code is available at

Abstract: Traffic demand prediction plays a critical role in intelligent transportation
systems. Existing traffic prediction models primarily rely on temporal traffic
data, with limited efforts incorporating human knowledge and experience for
urban traffic demand forecasting. However, in real-world scenarios, traffic
knowledge and experience derived from human daily life significantly influence
precise traffic prediction. Such knowledge and experiences can guide the model
in uncovering latent patterns within traffic data, thereby enhancing the
accuracy and robustness of predictions. To this end, this paper proposes
integrating structured temporal traffic data with textual data representing
human knowledge and experience, resulting in a novel knowledge-guided
cross-modal feature representation learning (KGCM) model for traffic demand
prediction. Based on regional transportation characteristics, we construct a
prior knowledge dataset using a large language model combined with manual
authoring and revision, covering both regional and global knowledge and
experiences. The KGCM model then learns multimodal data features through
designed local and global adaptive graph networks, as well as a cross-modal
feature fusion mechanism. A proposed reasoning-based dynamic update strategy
enables dynamic optimization of the graph model's parameters, achieving optimal
performance. Experiments on multiple traffic datasets demonstrate that our
model accurately predicts future traffic demand and outperforms existing
state-of-the-art (SOTA) models.

TL;DR: 这是一个配置先行框架，用于评估深度学习系统在CPU、GPU和编译运行时之间的跨后端兼容性，通过672次检测发现约72.0%运行通过，并提出了减少偏差的解决方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型在不同运行时环境中存在跨后端偏差问题，需要一个统一框架来系统性量化和缓解这些问题，确保在异构运行时环境中的可靠部署。

Method: 框架采用YAML配置文件将实验与代码解耦，支持库和仓库模型，并使用三层验证协议：张量级别接近度、激活对齐和任务级别指标。

Result: 在672次检测中，72.0%的运行通过检测，大多数差异出现在严格的容差间限下。检测模型和编译后端容易出现偏差，主要原因是非确定性后处理。

Conclusion: 该框架是第一个统一的系统性量化和缓解深度学习跨后端偏差的方案，通过确定性适配器和选择性回退机制可以在不严重影响性能的情况下显著提高一致性，为异构运行时环境提供可复现的可靠部署方法。

Abstract: This paper presents a configuration-first framework for evaluating
cross-backend compatibility in deep learning systems deployed on CPU, GPU, and
compiled runtimes. The framework decouples experiments from code using YAML,
supports both library and repository models, and employs a three-tier
verification protocol covering tensor-level closeness, activation alignment,
and task-level metrics. Through 672 checks across multiple models and tolerance
settings, we observe that 72.0% of runs pass, with most discrepancies occurring
under stricter thresholds. Our results show that detection models and compiled
backends are particularly prone to drift, often due to nondeterministic
post-processing. We further demonstrate that deterministic adapters and
selective fallbacks can substantially improve agreement without significant
performance loss. To our knowledge, this is the first unified framework that
systematically quantifies and mitigates cross-backend drift in deep learning,
providing a reproducible methodology for dependable deployment across
heterogeneous runtimes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统代理模型在高维随机变量下存在"维度灾难"问题，现有HDMR方法主要关注优化问题，而可靠性分析需要重点关注临界区域的预测精度。

Method: 采用三阶段框架：1)为所有随机变量构建单变量子代理模型；2)识别耦合变量子代理模型需求；3)构建耦合变量子代理模型。采用无候选样本池方法选择信息样本。

Result: 数值实验表明，该方法在解决高维可靠性问题时具有高计算效率和强预测精度。

Conclusion: 所提出的Kriging-HDMR主动学习方法能有效处理高维可靠性分析问题，在保持预测精度的同时显著提高计算效率。

Abstract: In reliability engineering, conventional surrogate models encounter the
"curse of dimensionality" as the number of random variables increases. While
the active learning Kriging surrogate approaches with high-dimensional model
representation (HDMR) enable effective approximation of high-dimensional
functions and are widely applied to optimization problems, there are rare
studies specifically focused on reliability analysis, which prioritizes
prediction accuracy in critical regions over uniform accuracy across the entire
domain. This study develops an active learning surrogate model method based on
the Kriging-HDMR modeling for reliability analysis. The proposed approach
facilitates the approximation of high-dimensional limit state functions through
a composite representation constructed from multiple low-dimensional
sub-surrogate models. The architecture of the surrogate modeling framework
comprises three distinct stages: developing single-variable sub-surrogate
models for all random variables, identifying the requirements for
coupling-variable sub-surrogate models, and constructing the coupling-variable
sub-surrogate models. Optimization mathematical models for selection of design
of experiment samples are formulated based on each stage's characteristics,
with objectives incorporating uncertainty variance, predicted mean, sample
location and inter-sample distances. A candidate sample pool-free approach is
adopted to achieve the selection of informative samples. Numerical experiments
demonstrate that the proposed method achieves high computational efficiency
while maintaining strong predictive accuracy in solving high-dimensional
reliability problems.

Motivation: 传统线性层在高维深度学习模型中占用了大量参数和计算成本，需要更高效的替代方案

Method: 使用查找表实现的多变量样条函数来构建高维映射，每个函数包含数十到数百个可训练参数但计算成本很低

Result: 推理FLOPs减少高达6.0倍，在甲烷配置数据集上实现10倍以上吞吐量提升，在CNN中减少1.6-2.1倍FLOPs

Conclusion: lmKANs提供了线性层的高效替代方案，在保持近似能力的同时显著降低计算成本

Abstract: High-dimensional linear mappings, or linear layers, dominate both the
parameter count and the computational cost of most modern deep-learning models.
We introduce a general drop-in replacement, lookup multivariate
Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (lmKANs), which deliver a substantially better
trade-off between capacity and inference cost. Our construction expresses a
general high-dimensional mapping through trainable low-dimensional multivariate
functions. These functions can carry dozens or hundreds of trainable parameters
each, and yet it takes only a few multiplications to compute them because they
are implemented as spline lookup tables. Empirically, lmKANs reduce inference
FLOPs by up to 6.0x while matching the flexibility of MLPs in general
high-dimensional function approximation. In another feedforward fully connected
benchmark, on the tabular-like dataset of randomly displaced methane
configurations, lmKANs enable more than 10x higher H100 throughput at equal
accuracy. Within frameworks of Convolutional Neural Networks, lmKAN-based CNNs
cut inference FLOPs at matched accuracy by 1.6-2.1x and by 1.7x on the CIFAR-10
and ImageNet-1k datasets, respectively. Our code, including dedicated CUDA
kernels, is available online at https://github.com/schwallergroup/lmkan.

TL;DR: 公交车达到时间预测方法NSATP，通过两阶段站点化和非站定性恢复，在提高预测准确性的同时保留非站定性特征，在电车和公交车数据上都取得了更好的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多步预测中非站定数据会降低模型性能，传统的归一化方法容易导致过度站点化问题，隐藏了非站定性中的有用特征。

Method: 提出两阶段方法NSATP：1)时间序列站点化提高预测性；2)将一维方法扩展到二维模型捕获周期性，并设计补偿模块学习缩放和偏移因子恢复非站定性效果。

Result: 在德約斯顿125天公交数据上，NSATP比基线方法在电车上降低RMSE、MAE、MAPE分别为2.37%、1.22%、2.26%，在公交车上分别为1.72%、0.60%、1.17%。

Conclusion: NSATP方法能够在预测性和非站定性之间取得平衡，通过保留非站定性中的有用特征来提高公交车到达时间预测的准确性。

Abstract: Arrival time prediction (ATP) of public transport vehicles is essential in
improving passenger experience and supporting traffic management. Deep learning
has demonstrated outstanding performance in ATP due to its ability to model
non-linear and temporal dynamics. In the multi-step ATP, non-stationary data
will degrade the model performance due to the variation in variables' joint
distribution along the temporal direction. Previous studies mainly applied
normalization to eliminate the non-stationarity in time series, thereby
achieving better predictability. However, the normalization may obscure useful
characteristics inherent in non-stationarity, which is known as the
over-stationarization. In this work, to trade off predictability and
non-stationarity, a new approach for multi-step ATP, named non-stationary ATP (
NSATP), is proposed. The method consists of two stages: series stationarization
and non-stationarity effect recovery. The first stage aims at improving the
predictability. As for the latter, NSATP extends a state-of-the-art method from
one-dimensional to two dimensional based models to capture the hidden
periodicity in time series and designs a compensation module of
over-stationarization by learning scaling and shifting factors from raw data.
125 days' public transport operational data of Dresden is collected for
validation. Experimental results show that compared to baseline methods, the
proposed NSATP can reduce RMSE, MAE, and MAPE by 2.37%, 1.22%, and 2.26% for
trams and by 1.72%, 0.60%, and 1.17% for buses, respectively.

Abstract: Large language models excel at basic reasoning but struggle with tasks that
require interaction with external tools. We present RLFactory, a plug-and-play
reinforcement learning post-training framework for multi-round tool use.
RLFactory tackles (i) tool-call stability and adaptability amid tool
heterogeneity and interface issues via an asyncio-based asynchronous caller and
a decoupled tool/training architecture, and (ii) diverse evaluation needs via a
reward layer supporting rule-based, model-judgment, and tool-verification
signals. It reconstructs the MDP by introducing observation markers from tool
feedback, closing the loop among model, tools, and environment, and implements
a generate-parse-invoke-update workflow for dynamic policy optimization. On
Search-R1 with Qwen3-4B, RLFactory achieves a 0.486 test score on the Natural
Questions (NQ) dataset, surpassing larger models trained with similar
techniques (e.g., Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-GRPO at 0.473), and increases training
throughput by 6.8x. RLFactory provides a low-barrier, highly adaptable

applications, ensuring the safety of their outputs during decoding has become a
critical challenge. However, existing decoding-time interventions, such as
Contrastive Decoding, often force a severe trade-off between safety and
response quality. In this work, we propose CARE, a novel framework for
decoding-time safety alignment that integrates three key components: (1) a
guard model for real-time safety monitoring, enabling detection of potentially
unsafe content; (2) a rollback mechanism with a token buffer to correct unsafe
outputs efficiently at an earlier stage without disrupting the user experience;
and (3) a novel introspection-based intervention strategy, where the model
generates self-reflective critiques of its previous outputs and incorporates
these reflections into the context to guide subsequent decoding steps. The
framework achieves a superior safety-quality trade-off by using its guard model
for precise interventions, its rollback mechanism for timely corrections, and
our novel introspection method for effective self-correction. Experimental
results demonstrate that our framework achieves a superior balance of safety,
quality, and efficiency, attaining a low harmful response rate and minimal
disruption to the user experience while maintaining high response quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有联邦LoRA方法假设统一秩配置和单模态输入，忽视了现实中的异构客户端资源和多模态数据缺失问题

Method: 提出维度聚合策略重新加权LoRA更新，以及轻量级层间模型编辑方法选择性整合全局参数修复本地组件

Result: 在三个多模态基准数据集上，FediLoRA在全局和个性化设置中都优于基线方法，特别是在模态不完整情况下

Conclusion: FediLoRA有效解决了联邦学习中异构LoRA秩和多模态缺失的挑战，为实际部署提供了实用解决方案

Abstract: Foundation models have demonstrated remarkable performance across a wide
range of tasks, yet their large parameter sizes pose challenges for practical
deployment, especially in decentralized environments. Parameter-efficient
fine-tuning (PEFT), such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), reduces local computing
and memory overhead, making it attractive for federated learning. However,
existing federated LoRA methods typically assume uniform rank configurations
and unimodal inputs, overlooking two key real-world challenges: (1)
heterogeneous client resources have different LoRA ranks, and (2) multimodal
data settings with potentially missing modalities. In this work, we propose
FediLoRA, a simple yet effective framework for federated multimodal fine-tuning
under heterogeneous LoRA ranks and missing modalities. FediLoRA introduces a
dimension-wise aggregation strategy that reweights LoRA updates without
information dilution during aggregation. It also includes a lightweight
layer-wise model editing method that selectively incorporates global parameters
to repair local components which improves both client and global model
performances. Experimental results on three multimodal benchmark datasets
demonstrate that FediLoRA achieves superior performance over competitive
baselines in both global and personalized settings, particularly in the
presence of modality incompleteness.

TL;DR: 使用双向LSTM网络学习逆向映射，从流行病时间序列预测SIR模型参数，实现高效准确的模型检验


<details>

Motivation: 传统的基于贝叶斯的近似检验方法计算成本高、效率低，需要一种更快速的流行病模型检验方法

Method: 构建三层双向LSTM网络，输入60天发病率、人口规模和恢复率，输出传播概率、接触率和R0。采用复合损失函数，包含流行病学动机的一致性罚项

Result: 在1000个场景模拟中，方法在所有目标参数上错误更低（MAE：R0 0.0616 vs 0.275），预测区间更紧凑且覆盖率接近名义值，检验时间从77.4秒降到2.35秒

Conclusion: 该方法能够更准确地重现流行病曲线，实现了快速而实用的模型检验，尽管接触率和传播概率存在部分不可识别性

Abstract: Calibrating agent-based epidemic models is computationally demanding. We
present a supervised machine learning calibrator that learns the inverse
mapping from epidemic time series to SIR parameters. A three-layer
bidirectional LSTM ingests 60-day incidence together with population size and
recovery rate, and outputs transmission probability, contact rate, and R0.
Training uses a composite loss with an epidemiology-motivated consistency
penalty that encourages R0 \* recovery rate to equal transmission probability
\* contact rate.
  In a 1000-scenario simulation study, we compare the calibrator with
Approximate Bayesian Computation (likelihood-free MCMC). The method achieves
lower error across all targets (MAE: R0 0.0616 vs 0.275; transmission 0.0715 vs
0.128; contact 1.02 vs 4.24), produces tighter predictive intervals with near
nominal coverage, and reduces wall clock time from 77.4 s to 2.35 s per
calibration. Although contact rate and transmission probability are partially
nonidentifiable, the approach reproduces epidemic curves more faithfully than
ABC, enabling fast and practical calibration. We evaluate it on SIR agent based
epidemics generated with epiworldR and provide an implementation in R.

Abstract: The Flexible Job-shop Scheduling Problem (FJSP) is a classical combinatorial
optimization problem that has a wide-range of applications in the real world.
In order to generate fast and accurate scheduling solutions for FJSP, various
deep reinforcement learning (DRL) scheduling methods have been developed.
However, these methods are mainly focused on the design of DRL scheduling
Agent, overlooking the modeling of DRL environment. This paper presents a
simple chronological DRL environment for FJSP based on discrete event
simulation and an end-to-end DRL scheduling model is proposed based on the
proximal policy optimization (PPO). Furthermore, a short novel state
representation of FJSP is proposed based on two state variables in the
scheduling environment and a novel comprehensible reward function is designed
based on the scheduling area of machines. Experimental results on public
benchmark instances show that the performance of simple priority dispatching
rules (PDR) is improved in our scheduling environment and our DRL scheduling
model obtains competing performance compared with OR-Tools, meta-heuristic, DRL
and PDR scheduling methods.

Abstract: The increasing size of large neural network models, specifically language
models and foundational image models, poses deployment challenges, prompting
efforts to reduce memory requirements and enhance computational efficiency.
These efforts are critical to ensure practical deployment and effective
utilization of these models across various applications. In this work, a novel
type of neural network layers and models is developed that uses only single-bit
parameters. In this novel type of models all parameters of all layers,
including kernel weights and biases, only have values equal to zero or one.
This novel type of models uses layers named as binary normalized layer. These
binary normalized layers can be of any type, such as fully connected,
convolutional, attention, etc., and they consist of slight variations of the
corresponding conventional layers. To show the effectiveness of the binary
normalized layers, two different models are configured to solve a multiclass
image classification problem and a language decoder to predict the next token
of a sequence. The model to solve the image classification has convolutional
and fully connected layers, and the language model is composed of transformer
blocks with multi-head attention. The results show that models with binary
normalized layers present almost the same results obtained by equivalent models
with real 32-bit parameters. The binary normalized layers allow to develop
models that use 32 times less memory than current models and have equivalent
performance. Besides, the binary normalized layers can be easily implemented on
current computers using 1-bit arrays, and do not require the development of
dedicated electronic hardware. This novel type of layers opens a new era for
large neural network models with reduced memory requirements that can be
deployed using simple and cheap hardware, such as mobile devices or only cpus.

Conclusion: 该方法解决了从PASFA模型和观测数据中高效推断慢特征状态的问题，避免了传统卡尔曼滤波方法无法恢复原始有用表示的局限性。

Abstract: Slow feature analysis (SFA), as a method for learning slowly varying features
in classification and signal analysis, has attracted increasing attention in
recent years. Recent probabilistic extensions to SFA learn effective
representations for classification tasks. Notably, the Probabilistic Adaptive
Slow Feature Analysis models the slow features as states in an ARMA process and
estimate the model from the observations. However, there is a need to develop
efficient methods to infer the states (slow features) from the observations and
the model. In this paper, a recursive extension to the linear PASFA has been
proposed. The proposed algorithm performs MMSE estimation of states evolving
according to an ARMA process, given the observations and the model. Although
current methods tackle this problem using Kalman filters after transforming the
ARMA process into a state space model, the original states (or slow features)
that form useful representations cannot be easily recovered. The proposed
technique is evaluated on a synthetic dataset to demonstrate its correctness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统贝叶斯方法需要对所有参数建立概率模型，这阻碍了复杂结构约束的融入。需要一种更简约的框架来处理具有约束的序列决策问题。

Method: 采用轮廓似然消除冗余参数，仅对核心参数设置先验。开发了MINimalist Thompson Sampling (MINTS)算法作为具体实现。

Result: 框架适用于连续臂Lipschitz bandits、动态定价等结构化问题，为经典凸优化算法提供概率视角。对多臂老虎机问题建立了接近最优的遗憾保证。

Conclusion: 该简约贝叶斯框架成功解决了传统方法难以处理复杂约束的问题，MINTS算法在多个场景下表现优异，为序列决策提供了新的理论工具。

Abstract: The Bayesian paradigm offers principled tools for sequential decision-making
under uncertainty, but its reliance on a probabilistic model for all parameters
can hinder the incorporation of complex structural constraints. We introduce a
minimalist Bayesian framework that places a prior only on the component of
interest, such as the location of the optimum. Nuisance parameters are
eliminated via profile likelihood, which naturally handles constraints. As a
direct instantiation, we develop a MINimalist Thompson Sampling (MINTS)
algorithm. Our framework accommodates structured problems, including
continuum-armed Lipschitz bandits and dynamic pricing. It also provides a
probabilistic lens on classical convex optimization algorithms such as the
center of gravity and ellipsoid methods. We further analyze MINTS for
multi-armed bandits and establish near-optimal regret guarantees.

Motivation: 探索金融时间序列分析的方法论方法，通过结合因果发现和不确定性预测来提高经济预测的准确性和健壮性，为经济政策提供信息支持

Method: 使用LPCMCI框架配合GPDC方法分析1970-2021年美国四大宏观经济指标的动态因果关系，然后利用Chronos大语言模型进行失业率的零样本概率预测

Result: 发现经济增长到GDP的单向因果关系，通胀缩小连通性有限，失业率显示强自回归依赖性。Chronos模型能够在不需任务特定训练的情况下准确预测1-2季度失业率，提供90%置信区间并支持异常检测

Conclusion: 证明了结合因果结构学习与概率语言模型在经济预测中的价值，为提高预测健壮性和支持经济政策决策提供了有效方法

Abstract: This paper presents a methodological approach to financial time series
analysis by combining causal discovery and uncertainty-aware forecasting. As a
case study, we focus on four key U.S. macroeconomic indicators -- GDP, economic
growth, inflation, and unemployment -- and we apply the LPCMCI framework with
Gaussian Process Distance Correlation (GPDC) to uncover dynamic causal
relationships in quarterly data from 1970 to 2021. Our results reveal a robust
unidirectional causal link from economic growth to GDP and highlight the
limited connectivity of inflation, suggesting the influence of latent factors.
Unemployment exhibits strong autoregressive dependence, motivating its use as a
case study for probabilistic forecasting. Leveraging the Chronos framework, a
large language model trained for time series, we perform zero-shot predictions
on unemployment. This approach delivers accurate forecasts one and two quarters
ahead, without requiring task-specific training. Crucially, the model's
uncertainty-aware predictions yield 90\% confidence intervals, enabling
effective anomaly detection through statistically principled deviation
analysis. This study demonstrates the value of combining causal structure
learning with probabilistic language models to inform economic policy and
enhance forecasting robustness.

Motivation: 解决人工智能在光伏监测中遇到的可解释性障碍，尤其是需要验证深度学习模型的决策是否符合热物理原理，以消除部署疑虑。

Method: 系统比较了卷积神经网络(ResNet-18, EfficientNet-B0)和视觉Transformer(ViT-Tiny, Swin-Tiny)，使用XRAI显性分析来评估模型与热物理原理的一致性，基于20,000张红外图像进行评估。

Result: Swin Transformer获得最高性能(94%二元准确率；73%多类别准确率)，XRAI分析显示模型学习到了物理意义特征。但不同故障类型性能差异显著：电气故障检测强(F1分数>0.90)，而环境因素如污染检测困难(F1分数0.20-0.33)。

Conclusion: 热物理导向的可解释性方法为验证AI在能源监测中的决策提供了方法论支撑，有助于充分利用AI技术推进可再生能源基础设施的发展。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence deployment for automated photovoltaic (PV) monitoring
faces interpretability barriers that limit adoption in energy infrastructure
applications. While deep learning achieves high accuracy in thermal fault
detection, validation that model decisions align with thermal physics
principles remains lacking, creating deployment hesitancy where understanding
model reasoning is critical. This study provides a systematic comparison of
convolutional neural networks (ResNet-18, EfficientNet-B0) and vision
transformers (ViT-Tiny, Swin-Tiny) for thermal PV fault detection, using XRAI
saliency analysis to assess alignment with thermal physics principles. This
represents the first systematic comparison of CNNs and vision transformers for
thermal PV fault detection with physics-validated interpretability. Evaluation
on 20,000 infrared images spanning normal operation and 11 fault categories
shows that Swin Transformer achieves the highest performance (94% binary
accuracy; 73% multiclass accuracy) compared to CNN approaches. XRAI analysis
reveals that models learn physically meaningful features, such as localized
hotspots for cell defects, linear thermal paths for diode failures, and thermal
boundaries for vegetation shading, consistent with expected thermal signatures.
However, performance varies significantly across fault types: electrical faults
achieve strong detection (F1-scores >0.90) while environmental factors like
soiling remain challenging (F1-scores 0.20-0.33), indicating limitations
imposed by thermal imaging resolution. The thermal physics-guided
interpretability approach provides methodology for validating AI
decision-making in energy monitoring applications, addressing deployment
barriers in renewable energy infrastructure.

Conclusion: GyroBN提供了一个理论严谨且通用的黎曼批量归一化框架，适用于具有陀螺结构的各种非欧几里得流形数据

Abstract: Normalization layers are crucial for deep learning, but their Euclidean
formulations are inadequate for data on manifolds. On the other hand, many
Riemannian manifolds in machine learning admit gyro-structures, enabling
principled extensions of Euclidean neural networks to non-Euclidean domains.
Inspired by this, we introduce GyroBN, a principled Riemannian batch
normalization framework for gyrogroups. We establish two necessary conditions,
namely \emph{pseudo-reduction} and \emph{gyroisometric gyrations}, that
guarantee GyroBN with theoretical control over sample statistics, and show that
these conditions hold for all known gyrogroups in machine learning. Our
framework also incorporates several existing Riemannian normalization methods
as special cases. We further instantiate GyroBN on seven representative
geometries, including the Grassmannian, five constant curvature spaces, and the
correlation manifold, and derive novel gyro and Riemannian structures to enable
these instantiations. Experiments across these geometries demonstrate the
effectiveness of GyroBN. The code is available at

Motivation: 现有图基础模型(GFMs)在真实图数据上的泛化性能力有限，而表格基础模型(TFMs)在多个领域都表现出艰强的逆应用能力，因此考虑将节点分类重构为表格问题。

Method: 首先通过特征和结构编码器将图转换为表格，然后应用多个TFMs对多样化子采样表格进行处理，最后通过集成选择汇总输出结果。

Result: 在28个实际数据集上，TabGFM实现了比任务特定GNNs和最先进GFMs更一致的性能收益。

Conclusion: 表格重构方法为可扩展和可泛化的图学习提供了新的潜力。

Abstract: Graph foundation models (GFMs) have recently emerged as a promising paradigm
for achieving broad generalization across various graph data. However, existing
GFMs are often trained on datasets that were shown to poorly represent
real-world graphs, limiting their generalization performance. In contrast,
tabular foundation models (TFMs) not only excel at classical tabular prediction
tasks but have also shown strong applicability in other domains such as time
series forecasting, natural language processing, and computer vision. Motivated
by this, we take an alternative view to the standard perspective of GFMs and
reformulate node classification as a tabular problem. Each node can be
represented as a row with feature, structure, and label information as columns,
enabling TFMs to directly perform zero-shot node classification via in-context
learning. In this work, we introduce TabGFM, a graph foundation model framework
that first converts a graph into a table via feature and structural encoders,
applies multiple TFMs to diversely subsampled tables, and then aggregates their
outputs through ensemble selection. Through experiments on 28 real-world
datasets, TabGFM achieves consistent improvements over task-specific GNNs and
state-of-the-art GFMs, highlighting the potential of tabular reformulation for
scalable and generalizable graph learning.

Result: 论文提供了EICS指标的实践指南，包括分数解释、计算开销（快速和精确模式）以及植入性检验分析。

Conclusion: EICS为评估Transformer电路的一致性和可靠性提供了一种形式化的单次过程方法，但实验验证尚未进行。

Abstract: Mechanistic interpretability has identified functional subgraphs within large
language models (LLMs), known as Transformer Circuits (TCs), that appear to
implement specific algorithms. Yet we lack a formal, single-pass way to
quantify when an active circuit is behaving coherently and thus likely
trustworthy. Building on prior systems-theoretic proposals, we specialize a
sheaf/cohomology and causal emergence perspective to TCs and introduce the
Effective-Information Consistency Score (EICS). EICS combines (i) a normalized
sheaf inconsistency computed from local Jacobians and activations, with (ii) a
Gaussian EI proxy for circuit-level causal emergence derived from the same
forward state. The construction is white-box, single-pass, and makes units
explicit so that the score is dimensionless. We further provide practical
guidance on score interpretation, computational overhead (with fast and exact
modes), and a toy sanity-check analysis. Empirical validation on LLM tasks is
deferred.

Abstract: Discovering novel materials is critical for technological advancements such
as solar cells, batteries, and carbon capture. However, the development of new
materials is constrained by a slow and expensive trial-and-error process. To
accelerate this pipeline, we introduce PLaID++, a Large Language Model (LLM)
fine-tuned for stable and property-guided crystal generation. We fine-tune
Qwen-2.5 7B to generate crystal structures using a novel Wyckoff-based text
representation. We show that generation can be effectively guided with a
reinforcement learning technique based on Direct Preference Optimization (DPO),
with sampled structures categorized by their stability, novelty, and space
group. By encoding symmetry constraints directly into text and guiding model
outputs towards desirable chemical space, PLaID++ generates structures that are
thermodynamically stable, unique, and novel at a $\sim$50\% greater rate than
prior methods and conditionally generates structures with desired space group
properties. Our experiments highlight the effectiveness of iterative DPO,
achieving $\sim$115\% and $\sim$50\% improvements in unconditional and space
group conditioned generation, respectively, compared to fine-tuning alone. Our
work demonstrates the potential of adapting post-training techniques from
natural language processing to materials design, paving the way for targeted

Result: 理论分析了表示学习阶段，实证表明Fed-REACT在真实数据集上实现了更高的准确性和鲁棒性

Conclusion: Fed-REACT框架有效解决了联邦学习中的异构和演化数据问题，提升了模型性能

Abstract: Motivated by the high resource costs and privacy concerns associated with
centralized machine learning, federated learning (FL) has emerged as an
efficient alternative that enables clients to collaboratively train a global
model while keeping their data local. However, in real-world deployments,
client data distributions often evolve over time and differ significantly
across clients, introducing heterogeneity that degrades the performance of
standard FL algorithms. In this work, we introduce Fed-REACT, a federated
learning framework designed for heterogeneous and evolving client data.
Fed-REACT combines representation learning with evolutionary clustering in a
two-stage process: (1) in the first stage, each client learns a local model to
extracts feature representations from its data; (2) in the second stage, the
server dynamically groups clients into clusters based on these representations
and coordinates cluster-wise training of task-specific models for downstream
objectives such as classification or regression. We provide a theoretical
analysis of the representation learning stage, and empirically demonstrate that
Fed-REACT achieves superior accuracy and robustness on real-world datasets.

Abstract: In pharmaceutical R&D, predicting the efficacy of a pharmaceutical in
treating a particular disease prior to clinical testing or any real-world use
has been challenging. In this paper, we propose a flexible and modular machine
learning-based approach for predicting the efficacy of an untested
pharmaceutical for treating a disease. We train a machine learning model using
sets of pharmaceutical-pathway weight impact scores and patient data, which can
include patient characteristics and observed clinical outcomes. The resulting
model then analyses weighted impact scores of an untested pharmaceutical across
human biological molecule-protein pathways to generate a predicted efficacy
value. We demonstrate how the method works on a real-world dataset with patient
treatments and outcomes, with two different weight impact score algorithms We
include methods for evaluating the generalisation performance on unseen
treatments, and to characterise conditions under which the approach can be
expected to be most predictive. We discuss specific ways in which our approach
can be iterated on, making it an initial framework to support future work on
predicting the effect of untested drugs, leveraging RWD clinical data and drug
embeddings.

TL;DR: 量化加剧模型偏见，提出混合精度QAT与加权损失方法实现公平量化部署


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 发现后训练量化(PTQ)会加剧模型对不同群体的差异性影响，特别是对少数群体的准确率影响更大

Method: 分析量化过程中权重和激活值变化导致的连锁影响，研究梯度范数和Hessian矩阵特征值，提出混合精度量化感知训练(QAT)结合数据集采样和加权损失函数

Result: 量化导致logits方差降低、损失增加、群体准确率受损，通过提出的方法可以缓解这些负面影响

Conclusion: 量化会放大模型偏见，需要采用混合精度QAT和公平性优化技术来实现公平的量化神经网络部署

Abstract: Post Training Quantization (PTQ) is widely adopted due to its high
compression capacity and speed with minimal impact on accuracy. However, we
observed that disparate impacts are exacerbated by quantization, especially for
minority groups. Our analysis explains that in the course of quantization there
is a chain of factors attributed to a disparate impact across groups during
forward and backward passes. We explore how the changes in weights and
activations induced by quantization cause cascaded impacts in the network,
resulting in logits with lower variance, increased loss, and compromised group
accuracies. We extend our study to verify the influence of these impacts on
group gradient norms and eigenvalues of the Hessian matrix, providing insights
into the state of the network from an optimization point of view. To mitigate
these effects, we propose integrating mixed precision Quantization Aware
Training (QAT) with dataset sampling methods and weighted loss functions,
therefore providing fair deployment of quantized neural networks.

Abstract: This paper presents a practical investigation into fine-tuning model
parameters for mathematical reasoning tasks through experimenting with various
configurations including randomness control, reasoning depth, and sampling
strategies, careful tuning demonstrates substantial improvements in efficiency
as well as performance. A holistically optimized framework is introduced for
five state-of-the-art models on mathematical reasoning tasks, exhibiting
significant performance boosts while maintaining solution correctness. Through
systematic parameter optimization across Qwen2.5-72B, Llama-3.1-70B,
DeepSeek-V3, Mixtral-8x22B, and Yi-Lightning, consistent efficiency gains are
demonstrated with 100% optimization success rate. The methodology achieves an
average 29.4% reduction in computational cost and 23.9% improvement in
inference speed across all tested models. This framework systematically
searches parameter spaces including temperature (0.1-0.5), reasoning steps
(4-12), planning periods (1-4), and nucleus sampling (0.85-0.98), determining
optimal configurations through testing on mathematical reasoning benchmarks.
Critical findings show that lower temperature regimes (0.1-0.4) and reduced
reasoning steps (4-6) consistently enhance efficiency without compromising
accuracy. DeepSeek-V3 achieves the highest accuracy at 98%, while Mixtral-8x22B
delivers the most cost-effective performance at 361.5 tokens per accurate
response. Key contributions include: (1) the first comprehensive optimization
study for five diverse SOTA models in mathematical reasoning, (2) a
standardized production-oriented parameter optimization framework, (3)
discovery of universal optimization trends applicable across model
architectures, and (4) production-ready configurations with extensive
performance characterization.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: IP-Basis PINNs是一种元学习框架，通过离线-在线分解解决物理信息神经网络在多查询逆问题中的计算效率问题，实现了快速参数识别和解决方案重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统PINNs在多查询逆问题中计算成本高昂，每个新的观测数据集都需要重新训练，限制了其实际应用效率。

Method: 采用离线-在线分解策略：离线训练深度网络生成基函数，在线冻结网络仅训练轻量级线性输出层；引入新型在线损失函数、前向模式自动微分和验证机制。

Result: 在三个不同基准测试中表现优异，包括扩展到未知函数项的通用PINNs；在常数和函数参数估计中表现一致，相比标准PINNs显著加速，在稀缺和噪声数据下稳健运行。

Conclusion: IP-Basis PINNs为逆问题提供了高效的计算框架，显著降低了多查询场景下的计算成本，同时保持了处理复杂问题的能力。

Abstract: Solving inverse problems with Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) is
computationally expensive for multi-query scenarios, as each new set of
observed data requires a new, expensive training procedure. We present
Inverse-Parameter Basis PINNs (IP-Basis PINNs), a meta-learning framework that
extends the foundational work of Desai et al. (2022) to enable rapid and
efficient inference for inverse problems. Our method employs an offline-online
decomposition: a deep network is first trained offline to produce a rich set of
basis functions that span the solution space of a parametric differential
equation. For each new inverse problem online, this network is frozen, and
solutions and parameters are inferred by training only a lightweight linear
output layer against observed data. Key innovations that make our approach
effective for inverse problems include: (1) a novel online loss formulation for
simultaneous solution reconstruction and parameter identification, (2) a
significant reduction in computational overhead via forward-mode automatic
differentiation for PDE loss evaluation, and (3) a non-trivial validation and
early-stopping mechanism for robust offline training. We demonstrate the
efficacy of IP-Basis PINNs on three diverse benchmarks, including an extension
to universal PINNs for unknown functional terms-showing consistent performance
across constant and functional parameter estimation, a significant speedup per
query over standard PINNs, and robust operation with scarce and noisy data.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GCond是一种基于PCGrad原理的多任务学习梯度冲突解决方法，通过梯度累积和自适应仲裁机制实现计算效率提升，在保持优化质量的同时获得两倍计算加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的梯度冲突解决方法（如PCGrad、CAGrad、GradNorm）计算成本高，限制了其在大模型和transformer中的应用，需要开发更高效的方法。

Method: 基于PCGrad原理，结合梯度累积和自适应仲裁机制，提出了Gradient Conductor (GCond)方法，支持随机模式实现计算加速。

Result: 在ImageNet 1K和头颈CT数据集上，GCond在所有评估指标上表现优异，L1和SSIM损失更低，对MobileNetV3-Small和ConvNeXt等不同规模架构都表现出高可扩展性，且与AdamW、Lion/LARS等现代优化器兼容。

Conclusion: GCond为多任务学习中的梯度冲突问题提供了一个可扩展且高效的解决方案，在计算效率和性能方面都有显著优势。

Abstract: In multi-task learning (MTL), gradient conflict poses a significant
challenge. Effective methods for addressing this problem, including PCGrad,
CAGrad, and GradNorm, in their original implementations are computationally
demanding, which significantly limits their application in modern large models
and transformers. We propose Gradient Conductor (GCond), a method that builds
upon PCGrad principles by combining them with gradient accumulation and an
adaptive arbitration mechanism. We evaluated GCond on self-supervised learning
tasks using MobileNetV3-Small and ConvNeXt architectures on the ImageNet 1K
dataset and a combined head and neck CT scan dataset, comparing the proposed
method against baseline linear combinations and state-of-the-art gradient
conflict resolution methods. The stochastic mode of GCond achieved a two-fold
computational speedup while maintaining optimization quality, and demonstrated
superior performance across all evaluated metrics, achieving lower L1 and SSIM
losses compared to other methods on both datasets. GCond exhibited high
scalability, being successfully applied to both compact models
(MobileNetV3-Small) and large architectures (ConvNeXt-tiny and ConvNeXt-Base).
It also showed compatibility with modern optimizers such as AdamW and
Lion/LARS. Therefore, GCond offers a scalable and efficient solution to the
problem of gradient conflicts in multi-task learning.

TL;DR: 一种基于变分贝叶斯推断的精强框架，能够从噪声、稀疏的相空数据中无监督学习各种广义哈密顿动力学系统。通过线性核、稳定性和守恒约束来提高模型的物理正确性和预测准确性。

Motivation: 虽然保守、耗散和端口哈密顿系统可能共享相同的初始能量，但单一的哈密顿网络模型很难捕捉相空中不同类型系统的特有动力学特征和物理规律。

Method: 扩展了稀疏对称随机佛里叶高斯过程学习方法，使用广义的状态和共轭动量哈密顿动力学形式。结合核化的ELBO损失、稳定性约束和守恒约束作为超参数平衡的损失项，用于正则化模型的多求导。

Conclusion: 该框架为复杂哈密顿流形学习挑战提供了一种精强的无监督解决方案，通过结合数据保真度和物理约束来实现更准确的预测与不确定性控制。

Abstract: We introduce a robust framework for learning various generalized Hamiltonian
dynamics from noisy, sparse phase-space data and in an unsupervised manner
based on variational Bayesian inference. Although conservative, dissipative,
and port-Hamiltonian systems might share the same initial total energy of a
closed system, it is challenging for a single Hamiltonian network model to
capture the distinctive and varying motion dynamics and physics of a phase
space, from sampled observational phase space trajectories. To address this
complicated Hamiltonian manifold learning challenge, we extend sparse
symplectic, random Fourier Gaussian processes learning with predictive
successive numerical estimations of the Hamiltonian landscape, using a
generalized form of state and conjugate momentum Hamiltonian dynamics,
appropriate to different classes of conservative, dissipative and
port-Hamiltonian physical systems. In addition to the kernelized evidence lower
bound (ELBO) loss for data fidelity, we incorporate stability and conservation
constraints as additional hyper-parameter balanced loss terms to regularize the
model's multi-gradients, enforcing physics correctness for improved prediction
accuracy with bounded uncertainty.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 密码破解任务作为研究神经网络在组合复杂领域中泛化能力的理想测试平台，需要从26!种可能的映射中选择正确的替换密码映射。

Method: 开发了ALICE架构，使用编码器Transformer和基于Gumbel-Sinkhorn方法的双射解码头来显式建模排列，支持直接提取学习到的密码映射。

Result: ALICE在仅训练约1500个独特密码（占可能密码空间的极小部分3.7×10^-24）后就能泛化到未见过的密码，实现了最先进的准确性和速度。

Conclusion: 该架构和分析方法可扩展到任何具有双射映射和组合结构的领域，为神经网络泛化和可解释性提供了新的见解。

Abstract: We present cryptogram solving as an ideal testbed for studying neural network
generalization in combinatorially complex domains. In this task, models must
decrypt text encoded with substitution ciphers, choosing from 26! possible
mappings without explicit access to the cipher. We develop ALICE (an
Architecture for Learning Interpretable Cryptogram dEcipherment): a simple
encoder-only Transformer that sets a new state-of-the-art for both accuracy and
speed on this decryption problem. Surprisingly, ALICE generalizes to unseen
ciphers after training on only ${\sim}1500$ unique ciphers, a minute fraction
($3.7 \times 10^{-24}$) of the possible cipher space. To enhance
interpretability, we introduce a novel bijective decoding head that explicitly
models permutations via the Gumbel-Sinkhorn method, enabling direct extraction
of learned cipher mappings. Through early exit analysis, we reveal how ALICE
progressively refines its predictions in a way that appears to mirror common
human strategies for this task: early layers employ frequency-based heuristics,
middle layers form word structures, and final layers correct individual
characters. Our architectural innovations and analysis methods extend beyond
cryptograms to any domain with bijective mappings and combinatorial structure,
offering new insights into neural network generalization and interpretability.

Result: 现有LLM具备领域特定知识，能生成高质量的代理基准（Spearman系数r=0.88，RMSE=0.08）；治疗建议的验证准确性达到AUROC=0.800，具有检查准确性和支持监管合规的关键能力

Conclusion: 这项工作建立了一个在临床上可行的LLM基于指南遵循系统的框架，在准确性、可解释性和监管要求之间取得平衡，同时降低了标注成本，为自动化临床决策支持提供了可扩展的途径

Abstract: The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) provides evidence-based
guidelines for cancer treatment. Translating complex patient presentations into
guideline-compliant treatment recommendations is time-intensive, requires
specialized expertise, and is prone to error. Advances in large language model
(LLM) capabilities promise to reduce the time required to generate treatment
recommendations and improve accuracy. We present an LLM agent-based approach to
automatically generate guideline-concordant treatment trajectories for patients
with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Our contributions are threefold.
First, we construct a novel longitudinal dataset of 121 cases of NSCLC patients
that includes clinical encounters, diagnostic results, and medical histories,
each expertly annotated with the corresponding NCCN guideline trajectories by
board-certified oncologists. Second, we demonstrate that existing LLMs possess
domain-specific knowledge that enables high-quality proxy benchmark generation
for both model development and evaluation, achieving strong correlation
(Spearman coefficient r=0.88, RMSE = 0.08) with expert-annotated benchmarks.
Third, we develop a hybrid approach combining expensive human annotations with
model consistency information to create both the agent framework that predicts
the relevant guidelines for a patient, as well as a meta-classifier that
verifies prediction accuracy with calibrated confidence scores for treatment
recommendations (AUROC=0.800), a critical capability for communicating the
accuracy of outputs, custom-tailoring tradeoffs in performance, and supporting
regulatory compliance. This work establishes a framework for clinically viable
LLM-based guideline adherence systems that balance accuracy, interpretability,
and regulatory requirements while reducing annotation costs, providing a
scalable pathway toward automated clinical decision support.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人口统计属性在电子健康记录中普遍存在且是重要的临床风险预测因子，但目前在模型设计中常被作为辅助角色，缺乏专门的表征学习方法

Method: 开发GDP预训练模型，探索不同的排序策略和编码方法，将表格形式的人口统计输入转换为潜在嵌入表示，使用多种疾病和人群组成的数据集进行预训练和评估

Result: 顺序排序策略显著提升了模型在判别、校准和决策树分裂信息增益方面的性能，特别是在年龄和性别对风险分层贡献显著的疾病中。即使在人口统计属性预测价值较低的数据集中，GDP也能增强其表征重要性

Conclusion: 针对表格人口统计属性的基础模型可以跨任务和人群泛化，为改善医疗保健应用的预测性能提供了有前景的方向

Abstract: Demographic attributes are universally present in electronic health records
and serve as vital predictors in clinical risk stratification and treatment
decisions. Despite their significance, these attributes are often relegated to
auxiliary roles in model design, with limited attention has been given to
learning their representations. This study proposes a General Demographic
Pre-trained (GDP) model as a foundational representation framework tailored to
age and gender. The model is pre-trained and evaluated using datasets with
diverse diseases and population compositions from different geographic regions.
The GDP architecture explores combinations of ordering strategies and encoding
methods to transform tabular demographic inputs into latent embeddings.
Experimental results demonstrate that sequential ordering substantially
improves model performance in discrimination, calibration, and the
corresponding information gain at each decision tree split, particularly in
diseases where age and gender contribute significantly to risk stratification.
Even in datasets where demographic attributes hold relatively low predictive
value, GDP enhances the representational importance, increasing their influence
in downstream gradient boosting models. The findings suggest that foundational
models for tabular demographic attributes can generalize across tasks and
populations, offering a promising direction for improving predictive
performance in healthcare applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实场景中客户端数据具有时变和非独立同分布特性，现有研究大多假设静态数据集，需要一种能够及时适应动态数据演化的高效模型训练方法。

Method: 使用Earth Mover's Distance量化时序漂移和集体差异，提出新颖的优化目标并开发联合调度和带宽分配算法，使系统能够快速学习新数据而不遗忘先前知识。

Result: 实验结果显示，相比随机调度方法，在CIFAR-10上收敛速度提高58.4%，在CIFAR-100上提高49.2%，实现了更高的测试精度和更快的收敛速度。

Conclusion: FedTeddi算法有效解决了联邦边缘学习在动态数据环境下的适应性问题，通过时序感知调度显著提升了训练效率和模型性能。

Abstract: Federated edge learning (FEEL) enables collaborative model training across
distributed clients over wireless networks without exposing raw data. While
most existing studies assume static datasets, in real-world scenarios clients
may continuously collect data with time-varying and non-independent and
identically distributed (non-i.i.d.) characteristics. A critical challenge is
how to adapt models in a timely yet efficient manner to such evolving data. In
this paper, we propose FedTeddi, a temporal-drift-and-divergence-aware
scheduling algorithm that facilitates fast convergence of FEEL under dynamic
data evolution and communication resource limits. We first quantify the
temporal dynamics and non-i.i.d. characteristics of data using temporal drift
and collective divergence, respectively, and represent them as the Earth
Mover's Distance (EMD) of class distributions for classification tasks. We then
propose a novel optimization objective and develop a joint scheduling and
bandwidth allocation algorithm, enabling the FEEL system to learn from new data
quickly without forgetting previous knowledge. Experimental results show that
our algorithm achieves higher test accuracy and faster convergence compared to
benchmark methods, improving the rate of convergence by 58.4% on CIFAR-10 and
49.2% on CIFAR-100 compared to random scheduling.

Motivation: 标准的隐式神经表示存在明显的频谱偏差，限制了其有效重建高频细节的能力，需要参数高效的改进方法。

Method: 提出SBS方法，包含：(1)单向排序平滑改善输出空间核平滑度；(2)基于单向排序平滑的自适应随机傅里叶特征，根据层参数数量调节输入编码频率带宽。

Result: 在ResNet模型和CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100、ImageNet数据集上的广泛评估显示，SBS以更少参数实现了显著更好的重建精度。

Conclusion: SBS通过抑制频谱偏差，在神经网络的神经表示中实现了更好的参数压缩和重建性能。

Abstract: Implicit neural representations have recently been extended to represent
convolutional neural network weights via neural representation for neural
networks, offering promising parameter compression benefits. However, standard
multi-layer perceptrons used in neural representation for neural networks
exhibit a pronounced spectral bias, hampering their ability to reconstruct
high-frequency details effectively. In this paper, we propose SBS, a
parameter-efficient enhancement to neural representation for neural networks
that suppresses spectral bias using two techniques: (1) a unidirectional
ordering-based smoothing that improves kernel smoothness in the output space,
and (2) unidirectional ordering-based smoothing aware random fourier features
that adaptively modulate the frequency bandwidth of input encodings based on
layer-wise parameter count. Extensive evaluations on various ResNet models with
datasets CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet, demonstrate that SBS achieves
significantly better reconstruction accuracy with less parameters compared to
SOTA.

this paper, we propose a novel framework that combines an EfficientNet-based
deep learning model with a digital twin system to improve the early detection

learn the features of cardiovascular images. In parallel, the digital twin
creates a realistic and individualized cardiovascular system model of the
patient based on data received from the Internet of Things (IoT) devices
attached to the patient, which can help in the constant assessment of the
patient and the impact of possible treatment plans. As shown by our
experiments, the proposed system is highly accurate in its prediction abilities
and, at the same time, efficient. Combining highly advanced techniques such as
deep learning and digital twin (DT) technology presents the possibility of
using an active and individual approach to predicting cardiac disease.

Abstract: We present a learning-based outlier-robust filter for a general setup where

characteristics during inference along with outlier-detection, EMORF-II has
improved outlier-mitigation capability. Numerical experiments confirm
performance gains as compared to the state-of-the-art methods in terms of

Motivation: 解决大型语言模型在RLVR微调中出现的多尝试性能(Pass@k)退化问题，以及灾难性遗忘现象，现有方法对散度项的选择和作用缺乏深入探讨。

Method: 提出DPH-RL框架，使用mass-covering f-divergences（前向KL和JS散度）作为排练机制，持续参考初始策略来保持广泛的解决方案覆盖范围。

Conclusion: 散度度量的正确选择是改进RLVR的关键因素，DPH-RL证明了通过散度项本身可以作为知识保留的有效解决方案，能够构建更通用和多样化的推理模型。

Abstract: A central paradox in fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) with
Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Reward (RLVR) is the frequent
degradation of multi-attempt performance (Pass@k) despite improvements in
single-attempt accuracy (Pass@1). This is often accompanied by catastrophic
forgetting, where models lose previously acquired skills. While various methods
have been proposed, the choice and function of the divergence term have been
surprisingly unexamined as a proactive solution. We argue that standard RLVR
objectives -- both those using the mode-seeking reverse KL-divergence and those
forgoing a divergence term entirely -- lack a crucial mechanism for knowledge
retention. The reverse-KL actively accelerates this decay by narrowing the
policy, while its absence provides no safeguard against the model drifting from
its diverse knowledge base. We propose a fundamental shift in perspective:
using the divergence term itself as the solution. Our framework,
Diversity-Preserving Hybrid RL (DPH-RL), leverages mass-covering f-divergences
(like forward-KL and JS-divergence) to function as a rehearsal mechanism. By
continuously referencing the initial policy, this approach forces the model to
maintain broad solution coverage. Extensive experiments on math and SQL
generation demonstrate that DPH-RL not only resolves the Pass@k degradation but
improves both Pass@1 and Pass@k in- and out-of-domain. Additionally, DPH-RL is
more training-efficient because it computes f-divergence using generator
functions, requiring only sampling from the initial policy and no online
reference model. Our work highlights a crucial, overlooked axis for improving
RLVR, demonstrating that the proper selection of a divergence measure is a
powerful tool for building more general and diverse reasoning models.

TL;DR: 提出新型卷积自编码器架构，用于用户建模和推荐任务，在隐式和显式反馈预测方面均达到最先进性能，并能联合学习多种交互类型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有推荐系统模型在同时处理显式评分和隐式交互模式方面存在局限，需要更灵活的架构来学习用户与物品之间的复杂关联，并提供更好的可解释性。

Method: 采用卷积自编码器架构，能够联合学习显式评分和隐式反馈信息，分别预测内容消费概率和高评分概率，并提供泛化界限理论保证。

Result: 在多个真实数据集上实验表明，该模型在隐式和显式反馈预测任务上都达到了最先进的性能，使用单一模型即可处理两种反馈类型。

Conclusion: 该卷积自编码器架构不仅性能优越，还能识别用户可能不会自然消费但会喜欢的物品，为推荐系统提供了更强的解释能力和理论保障。

Abstract: We introduce a new convolutional AutoEncoder architecture for user modelling
and recommendation tasks with several improvements over the state of the art.
Firstly, our model has the flexibility to learn a set of associations and
combinations between different interaction types in a way that carries over to
each user and item. Secondly, our model is able to learn jointly from both the
explicit ratings and the implicit information in the sampling pattern (which we
refer to as `implicit feedback'). It can also make separate predictions for the
probability of consuming content and the likelihood of granting it a high
rating if observed. This not only allows the model to make predictions for both
the implicit and explicit feedback, but also increases the informativeness of
the predictions: in particular, our model can identify items which users would
not have been likely to consume naturally, but would be likely to enjoy if
exposed to them. Finally, we provide several generalization bounds for our
model, which to the best of our knowledge, are among the first generalization
bounds for auto-encoders in a Recommender Systems setting; we also show that
optimizing our loss function guarantees the recovery of the exact sampling
distribution over interactions up to a small error in total variation. In
experiments on several real-life datasets, we achieve state-of-the-art
performance on both the implicit and explicit feedback prediction tasks despite
relying on a single model for both, and benefiting from additional
interpretability in the form of individual predictions for the probabilities of
each possible rating.

Abstract: Advancements in smart metering technologies have significantly improved the
ability to monitor and manage water utilities. In the context of increasing
uncertainty due to climate change, securing water resources and supply has
emerged as an urgent global issue with extensive socioeconomic ramifications.
Hourly consumption data from end-users have yielded substantial insights for
projecting demand across regions characterized by diverse consumption patterns.
Nevertheless, the prediction of water demand remains challenging due to
influencing non-deterministic factors, such as meteorological conditions. This
work introduces a novel method for short-term water demand forecasting for
District Metered Areas (DMAs) which encompass commercial, agricultural, and
residential consumers. Unsupervised contrastive learning is applied to
categorize end-users according to distinct consumption behaviors present within
a DMA. Subsequently, the distinct consumption behaviors are utilized as
features in the ensuing demand forecasting task using wavelet-transformed
convolutional networks that incorporate a cross-attention mechanism combining
both historical data and the derived representations. The proposed approach is
evaluated on real-world DMAs over a six-month period, demonstrating improved
forecasting performance in terms of MAPE across different DMAs, with a maximum
improvement of 4.9%. Additionally, it identifies consumers whose behavior is
shaped by socioeconomic factors, enhancing prior knowledge about the
deterministic patterns that influence demand.

Motivation: 在大规模信号中识别重复模式和罕见事件是天文学、物理模拟和生物医学等领域的基础挑战。卷积字典学习(CDL)虽然能有效建模信号局部结构，但在罕见事件检测方面存在高计算成本和异常敏感性的问题。

Method: RoseCDL结合了随机窗口化技术以实现大数据集上的高效训练，并采用在线异常检测来增强鲁棒性并隔离异常模式。

Conclusion: RoseCDL为现实世界信号中的事件发现和特征提取提供了一个实用的CDL框架，扩展了其在罕见事件检测方面的应用潜力。

Abstract: Identifying recurring patterns and rare events in large-scale signals is a
fundamental challenge in fields such as astronomy, physical simulations, and
biomedical science. Convolutional Dictionary Learning (CDL) offers a powerful
framework for modeling local structures in signals, but its use for detecting
rare or anomalous events remains largely unexplored. In particular, CDL faces
two key challenges in this setting: high computational cost and sensitivity to
artifacts and outliers. In this paper, we introduce RoseCDL, a scalable and
robust CDL algorithm designed for unsupervised rare event detection in long
signals. RoseCDL combines stochastic windowing for efficient training on large
datasets with inline outlier detection to enhance robustness and isolate
anomalous patterns. This reframes CDL as a practical tool for event discovery
and characterization in real-world signals, extending its role beyond
traditional tasks like compression or denoising.

TL;DR: 提出ΔL归一化方法，解决RLVR中动态生成长度导致的梯度方差大和优化不稳定问题，通过理论分析和实验验证其无偏性和最小方差特性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RLVR在提升大语言模型推理能力方面显示强大潜力，但训练过程中响应长度变化大导致梯度方差高和优化不稳定，现有方法存在估计偏差或高方差问题

Method: 通过理论分析不同长度对策略损失的影响，将问题重新表述为寻找最小方差无偏估计量，提出ΔL归一化方法

Result: 在多个模型大小、最大长度和任务上一致取得优异结果，理论上提供无偏估计并最小化梯度方差

Conclusion: ΔL归一化是一种简单有效的损失聚合方法，能有效解决RLVR中的长度变化问题，提升训练稳定性和性能

Abstract: We propose $\Delta L$ Normalization, a simple yet effective loss aggregation
method tailored to the characteristic of dynamic generation lengths in
Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR). Recently, RLVR has
demonstrated strong potential in improving the reasoning capabilities of large
language models (LLMs), but a major challenge lies in the large variability of
response lengths during training, which leads to high gradient variance and
unstable optimization. Although previous methods such as GRPO, DAPO, and Dr.
GRPO introduce different loss normalization terms to address this issue, they
either produce biased estimates or still suffer from high gradient variance. By
analyzing the effect of varying lengths on policy loss both theoretically and
empirically, we reformulate the problem as finding a minimum-variance unbiased
estimator. Our proposed $\Delta L$ Normalization not only provides an unbiased
estimate of the true policy loss but also minimizes gradient variance in
theory. Extensive experiments show that it consistently achieves superior
results across different model sizes, maximum lengths, and tasks. Our code will
be made public at https://github.com/zerolllin/Delta-L-Normalization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统神经元使用加权和加固定非线性函数，无法捕捉激活的多模态性和不确定性。uGMM-NN旨在将概率推理直接嵌入到神经网络的计算单元中，实现更丰富的表示能力。

Method: 每个uGMM-NN节点将其激活参数化为单变量高斯混合模型，具有可学习的均值、方差和混合系数，取代传统的加权和非线性激活函数。

Conclusion: 该框架为将不确定性感知组件集成到现代神经架构中奠定了基础，为判别性和生成性建模开辟了新方向。

Abstract: This paper introduces the Univariate Gaussian Mixture Model Neural Network
(uGMM-NN), a novel neural architecture that embeds probabilistic reasoning
directly into the computational units of deep networks. Unlike traditional
neurons, which apply weighted sums followed by fixed nonlinearities, each
uGMM-NN node parameterizes its activations as a univariate Gaussian mixture,
with learnable means, variances, and mixing coefficients. This design enables
richer representations by capturing multimodality and uncertainty at the level
of individual neurons, while retaining the scalability of standard feedforward
networks. We demonstrate that uGMM-NN can achieve competitive discriminative
performance compared to conventional multilayer perceptrons, while additionally
offering a probabilistic interpretation of activations. The proposed framework
provides a foundation for integrating uncertainty-aware components into modern
neural architectures, opening new directions for both discriminative and
generative modeling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统PINNs在处理具有不连续系数的材料（如分段常数属性介质）时经常失败，需要更可靠的方法来解决多尺度建模中的PDE问题

Method: 引入双重公式化到PINN框架，比较标准PINNs与变分PINNs(VPINNs)，使用谱和神经网络基的测试函数，推导保证的上下误差界限

Result: 强形式PINNs在受控环境下可能优于VPINNs，但对材料不连续性敏感且缺乏明确诊断；VPINNs能直接处理分段常数材料参数但需要仔细选择测试函数

Conclusion: 双重公式化作为收敛质量的可靠指标，集成到PINN框架中增强了其在微力学均匀化问题中的适用性

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have shown promise in solving
partial differential equations (PDEs) relevant to multiscale modeling, but they
often fail when applied to materials with discontinuous coefficients, such as
media with piecewise constant properties. This paper introduces a dual
formulation for the PINN framework to improve the reliability of the
homogenization of periodic thermo-conductive composites, for both strong and
variational (weak) formulations. The dual approach facilitates the derivation
of guaranteed upper and lower error bounds, enabling more robust detection of
PINN failure. We compare standard PINNs applied to smoothed material
approximations with variational PINNs (VPINNs) using both spectral and neural
network-based test functions. Our results indicate that while strong-form PINNs
may outperform VPINNs in controlled settings, they are sensitive to material
discontinuities and may fail without clear diagnostics. In contrast, VPINNs
accommodate piecewise constant material parameters directly but require careful
selection of test functions to avoid instability. Dual formulation serves as a
reliable indicator of convergence quality, and its integration into PINN
frameworks enhances their applicability to homogenization problems in
micromechanics.

Abstract: This paper presents an innovative Transformer-based deep learning strategy
for optimizing the placement of sensors aiming at structural health monitoring
of semiconductor probe cards. Failures in probe cards, including substrate
cracks and loosened screws, would critically affect semiconductor manufacturing
yield and reliability. Some failure modes could be detected by equipping a
probe card with adequate sensors. Frequency response functions from simulated
failure scenarios are adopted within a finite element model of a probe card. A
comprehensive dataset, enriched by physics-informed scenario expansion and
physics-aware statistical data augmentation, is exploited to train a hybrid
Convolutional Neural Network and Transformer model. The model achieves high
accuracy (99.83%) in classifying the probe card health states (baseline, loose
screw, crack) and an excellent crack detection recall (99.73%). Model
robustness is confirmed through a rigorous framework of 3 repetitions of
10-fold stratified cross-validation. The attention mechanism also pinpoints
critical sensor locations: an analysis of the attention weights offers
actionable insights for designing efficient, cost-effective monitoring systems
by optimizing sensor configurations. This research highlights the capability of
attention-based deep learning to advance proactive maintenance, enhancing
operational reliability and yield in semiconductor manufacturing.

Conclusion: 这项研究为不平衡学习中的模型选择提供了有价值指南，揭示了分类器在不依赖明确重新平衡技术时的稳健性特性。

Abstract: Class imbalance poses a significant challenge to supervised classification,
particularly in critical domains like medical diagnostics and anomaly detection
where minority class instances are rare. While numerous studies have explored
rebalancing techniques to address this issue, less attention has been given to
evaluating the performance of binary classifiers under imbalance when no such
techniques are applied. Therefore, the goal of this study is to assess the
performance of binary classifiers "as-is", without performing any explicit
rebalancing. Specifically, we systematically evaluate the robustness of a
diverse set of binary classifiers across both real-world and synthetic
datasets, under progressively reduced minority class sizes, using one-shot and
few-shot scenarios as baselines. Our approach also explores varying data
complexities through synthetic decision boundary generation to simulate
real-world conditions. In addition to standard classifiers, we include
experiments using undersampling, oversampling strategies, and one-class
classification (OCC) methods to examine their behavior under severe imbalance.
The results confirm that classification becomes more difficult as data
complexity increases and the minority class size decreases. While traditional
classifiers deteriorate under extreme imbalance, advanced models like TabPFN
and boosting-based ensembles retain relatively higher performance and better
generalization compared to traditional classifiers. Visual interpretability and
evaluation metrics further validate these findings. Our work offers valuable
guidance on model selection for imbalanced learning, providing insights into
classifier robustness without dependence on explicit rebalancing techniques.

Abstract: Neighbour embeddings (NE) allow the representation of high dimensional
datasets into lower dimensional spaces and are often used in data
visualisation. In practice, accelerated approximations are employed to handle
very large datasets. Accelerating NE is challenging, and two main directions
have been explored: very coarse approximations based on negative sampling (as
in UMAP) achieve high effective speed but may lack quality in the extracted
structures; less coarse approximations, as used in FIt-SNE or BH-t-SNE, offer
better structure preservation at the cost of speed, while also restricting the
target dimensionality to 2 or 3, limiting NE to visualisation. In some
variants, the precision of these costlier accelerations also enables
finer-grained control on the extracted structures through dedicated
hyperparameters.
  This paper proposes to bridge the gab between both approaches by introducing
a novel way to accelerate NE, requiring a small number of computations per
iteration while maintaining good fine-grained structure preservation and
flexibility through hyperparameter tuning, without limiting the dimensionality
of the embedding space. The method was designed for interactive exploration of
data; as such, it abandons the traditional two-phased approach of other NE
methods, allowing instantaneous visual feedback when changing hyperparameters,
even when these control processes happening on the high-dimensional side of the
computations. Experiments using a publicly available, GPU accelerated GUI
integration of the method show promising results in terms of speed, flexibility
in the structures getting extracted, and show potential uses in broader machine
learning contexts with minimal algorithmic modifications. Central to this
algorithm is a novel approach to iterative approximate nearest neighbour
search, which shows promising results compared to nearest neighbour descent.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法GinAR虽然首次使用注意力机制处理变量缺失，但缺乏可解释性且无法捕捉潜在时间模式，需要更可靠的解决方案

Method: 结合不确定性感知插值(UAI)和高斯核图卷积(GGCN)，使用MC Dropout估计重建值不确定性，双向递归单元增强时间依赖建模

Result: 在各种缺失率场景下实现了最先进的预测性能，提供了更可靠和可解释的框架

Conclusion: IBN为缺失变量的多变量时间序列预测提供了一个有效且可解释的解决方案，在性能和可靠性方面都有显著提升

Abstract: Multivariate time series forecasting (MTSF) often faces challenges from
missing variables, which hinder conventional spatial-temporal graph neural
networks in modeling inter-variable correlations. While GinAR addresses
variable missing using attention-based imputation and adaptive graph learning
for the first time, it lacks interpretability and fails to capture more latent
temporal patterns due to its simple recursive units (RUs). To overcome these
limitations, we propose the Interpretable Bidirectional-modeling Network (IBN),
integrating Uncertainty-Aware Interpolation (UAI) and Gaussian kernel-based
Graph Convolution (GGCN). IBN estimates the uncertainty of reconstructed values
using MC Dropout and applies an uncertainty-weighted strategy to mitigate
high-risk reconstructions. GGCN explicitly models spatial correlations among
variables, while a bidirectional RU enhances temporal dependency modeling.
Extensive experiments show that IBN achieves state-of-the-art forecasting
performance under various missing-rate scenarios, providing a more reliable and
interpretable framework for MTSF with missing variables. Code is available at:

Motivation: MoE模型在有限GPU内存下的高效服务面临挑战，将非激活专家卸载到主内存需要解决数据传输问题，需要探索专家压缩方法并分析压缩误差对推理性能的影响

Method: 采用误差有界损失压缩算法（如SZ3和CuSZp）压缩非激活专家，在不同基准测试上进行广泛实验，全面分析不同专家压缩误差对整体推理精度的影响

Result: 浅层专家（负责注意力机制和输入标记向量化）对压缩误差敏感度低；中间层专家（负责模型推理）误差会显著损害推理精度；深层专家（负责指令跟随和输出整合）的有界误差有时反而能提高推理精度

Conclusion: 不同层级的专家对压缩误差的敏感性不同，需要针对不同层级采用差异化的压缩策略，浅层和深层专家可以承受更大压缩，而中间层专家需要更谨慎处理

Abstract: With the widespread application of Mixture of Experts (MoE) reasoning models
in the field of LLM learning, efficiently serving MoE models under limited GPU
memory constraints has emerged as a significant challenge. Offloading the
non-activated experts to main memory has been identified as an efficient
approach to address such a problem, while it brings the challenges of
transferring the expert between the GPU memory and main memory. We need to
explore an efficient approach to compress the expert and analyze how the
compression error affects the inference performance.
  To bridge this gap, we propose employing error-bounded lossy compression
algorithms (such as SZ3 and CuSZp) to compress non-activated experts, thereby
reducing data transfer overhead during MoE inference. We conduct extensive
experiments across various benchmarks and present a comprehensive analysis of
how compression-induced errors in different experts affect overall inference
accuracy. The results indicate that experts in the shallow layers, which are
primarily responsible for the attention mechanism and the transformation of
input tokens into vector representations, exhibit minimal degradation in
inference accuracy when subjected to bounded errors. In contrast, errors in the
middle-layer experts, which are central to model reasoning, significantly
impair inference accuracy. Interestingly, introducing bounded errors in the
deep-layer experts, which are mainly responsible for instruction following and
output integration, can sometimes lead to improvements in inference accuracy.

TL;DR: 通过逆问题方法探索LLM的缩放规律，提高构建效率和成本效益


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型训练成本高明，传统的尝试错误方法不可行，需要更高效的方法来提高性能与成本效益

Method: 受科学发现中逆问题的启发，建议采用逆问题方法来探索大语言模型的缩放规律

Result: 未提供具体实验结果（位置论文）

Conclusion: 逆问题方法有望为LLM开发提供更有效的缩放规律指导，降低训练成本并提高性能

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are large-scale pretrained models that have
achieved remarkable success across diverse domains. These successes have been
driven by unprecedented complexity and scale in both data and computations.
However, due to the high costs of training such models, brute-force
trial-and-error approaches to improve LLMs are not feasible. Inspired by the
success of inverse problems in uncovering fundamental scientific laws, this
position paper advocates that inverse problems can also efficiently uncover
scaling laws that guide the building of LLMs to achieve the desirable
performance with significantly better cost-effectiveness.

Abstract: This study applies a range of forecasting techniques,including ARIMA,
Prophet, Long Short Term Memory networks (LSTM), Temporal Convolutional
Networks (TCN), and XGBoost, to model and predict Russian equipment losses
during the ongoing war in Ukraine. Drawing on daily and monthly open-source

architectures and input structures, this study highlights the importance of
ensemble forecasting in conflict modeling, and the value of publicly available
OSINT data in quantifying material degradation over time.

Abstract: Predicting injuries and fatalities in traffic crashes plays a critical role
in enhancing road safety, improving emergency response, and guiding public
health interventions. This study investigates the added value of unstructured
crash narratives (written by police officers at the scene) when combined with
structured crash data to predict injury severity. Two widely used Natural
Language Processing (NLP) techniques, Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency
(TF-IDF) and Word2Vec, were employed to extract semantic meaning from the
narratives, and their effectiveness was compared. To address the challenge of
class imbalance, a K-Nearest Neighbors-based oversampling method was applied to
the training data prior to modeling. The dataset consists of crash records from
Kentucky spanning 2019 to 2023. To account for roadway heterogeneity, three
road classification schemes were used: (1) eight detailed functional classes
(e.g., Urban Two-Lane, Rural Interstate, Urban Multilane Divided), (2) four
broader paired categories (e.g., Urban vs. Rural, Freeway vs. Non-Freeway), and
(3) a unified dataset without classification. A total of 102 machine learning
models were developed by combining structured features and narrative-based
features using the two NLP techniques alongside three ensemble algorithms:
XGBoost, Random Forest, and AdaBoost. Results demonstrate that models
incorporating narrative data consistently outperform those relying solely on
structured data. Among all combinations, TF-IDF coupled with XGBoost yielded
the most accurate predictions in most subgroups. The findings highlight the
power of integrating textual and structured crash information to enhance
person-level injury prediction. This work offers a practical and adaptable
framework for transportation safety professionals to improve crash severity
modeling, guide policy decisions, and design more effective countermeasures.

TL;DR: 提出一种基于预训练深度学习模型的个性化组合药物筛选策略，通过药物嵌入聚类和剂量加权机制，解决肿瘤学中冷启动问题，提高初始筛选效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 个性化肿瘤组合疗法面临巨大的药物和剂量组合空间，传统实验方法不可行。患者来源模型虽然支持高通量筛选，但实验数量有限，且分子分析信息获取困难，导致冷启动问题。

Method: 利用历史药物反应数据预训练的深度学习模型，提供药物组合嵌入和剂量重要性评分。结合药物嵌入聚类确保功能多样性，以及基于历史信息量的剂量加权机制来选择初始实验。

Result: 在大规模药物组合数据集上的回顾性模拟显示，该方法相比基线方法显著提高了初始筛选效率。

Conclusion: 该方法为个性化组合药物筛选的早期决策提供了可行路径，能够更有效地指导初始实验选择。

Abstract: Personalizing combination therapies in oncology requires navigating an
immense space of possible drug and dose combinations, a task that remains
largely infeasible through exhaustive experimentation. Recent developments in
patient-derived models have enabled high-throughput ex vivo screening, but the
number of feasible experiments is limited. Further, a tight therapeutic window
makes gathering molecular profiling information (e.g. RNA-seq) impractical as a
means of guiding drug response prediction. This leads to a challenging
cold-start problem: how do we select the most informative combinations to test
early, when no prior information about the patient is available? We propose a
strategy that leverages a pretrained deep learning model built on historical
drug response data. The model provides both embeddings for drug combinations
and dose-level importance scores, enabling a principled selection of initial
experiments. We combine clustering of drug embeddings to ensure functional
diversity with a dose-weighting mechanism that prioritizes doses based on their
historical informativeness. Retrospective simulations on large-scale drug
combination datasets show that our method substantially improves initial
screening efficiency compared to baselines, offering a viable path for more
effective early-phase decision-making in personalized combination drug screens.

Motivation: 准确预测肾疗病体积（GTV）变化对PULSAR脱射治疗方案的个性化调整和病人选择具有重要预后价值

Method: 采用39名病人的69个脑转移疾病数据，提取影像组学和治疗组学特征，计算delta特征描述相对变化，使用Lasso算法进行特征选择，构建多种内核的SVR模型，采用5折交叉验证

Result: 多组学模型表现最佳，超过单一组学模型，delta影像组学特征显著提高预测准确性，最佳模型R2达到0.743，RRMSE为0.022

Conclusion: 该多组学SVR模型能够准确预测GTV的连续变化，为PULSAR治疗提供了量化和个性化的评估方法，有助于病人选择和治疗调整

Abstract: Personalized ultra-fractionated stereotactic adaptive radiotherapy (PULSAR)
is a novel treatment that delivers radiation in pulses of protracted intervals.
Accurate prediction of gross tumor volume (GTV) changes through regression
models has substantial prognostic value. This study aims to develop a
multi-omics based support vector regression (SVR) model for predicting GTV
change. A retrospective cohort of 39 patients with 69 brain metastases was
analyzed, based on radiomics (MRI images) and dosiomics (dose maps) features.
Delta features were computed to capture relative changes between two time
points. A feature selection pipeline using least absolute shrinkage and
selection operator (Lasso) algorithm with weight- or frequency-based ranking
criterion was implemented. SVR models with various kernels were evaluated using
the coefficient of determination (R2) and relative root mean square error
(RRMSE). Five-fold cross-validation with 10 repeats was employed to mitigate
the limitation of small data size. Multi-omics models that integrate radiomics,
dosiomics, and their delta counterparts outperform individual-omics models.
Delta-radiomic features play a critical role in enhancing prediction accuracy
relative to features at single time points. The top-performing model achieves
an R2 of 0.743 and an RRMSE of 0.022. The proposed multi-omics SVR model shows
promising performance in predicting continuous change of GTV. It provides a
more quantitative and personalized approach to assist patient selection and
treatment adjustment in PULSAR.

Motivation: 传统EEG睡眠监测设备笨重不便，限制了在家庭环境中的长期连续监测应用。耳内EEG设备可以提供无创、舒适的替代方案，特别适用于检测入睡时刻等消费级应用

Method: 使用11名参与者进行睡眠研究，采用定制耳塞设备（干式耳尖电极）采集单通道耳内电生理信号，以Apple Watch Ultra的睡眠分期作为地面真值，采用留一法交叉验证

Result: 系统在二元睡眠检测（清醒vs睡眠）上达到90.5%准确率，在四分类分期（清醒、REM、核心睡眠、深度睡眠）上达到65.1%准确率

Conclusion: 耳内电极作为一种低负担、舒适的睡眠监测方法具有巨大潜力，可用于如用户入睡时自动暂停媒体播放等实际应用

Abstract: Automatic sleep staging typically relies on gold-standard EEG setups, which
are accurate but obtrusive and impractical for everyday use outside sleep
laboratories. This limits applicability in real-world settings, such as home
environments, where continuous, long-term monitoring is needed. Detecting sleep
onset is particularly relevant, enabling consumer applications (e.g.
automatically pausing media playback when the user falls asleep). Recent
research has shown correlations between in-ear EEG and full-scalp EEG for
various phenomena, suggesting wearable, in-ear devices could allow unobtrusive
sleep monitoring. We investigated the feasibility of using single-channel
in-ear electrophysiological (ExG) signals for automatic sleep staging in a
wearable device by conducting a sleep study with 11~participants (mean age:
24), using a custom earpiece with a dry eartip electrode (D\"atwyler SoftPulse)
as a measurement electrode in one ear and a reference in the other. Ground
truth sleep stages were obtained from an Apple Watch Ultra, validated for sleep
staging. Our system achieved 90.5% accuracy for binary sleep detection (Awake
vs. Asleep) and 65.1% accuracy for four-class staging (Awake, REM, Core, Deep)
using leave-one-subject-out validation. These findings demonstrate the
potential of in-ear electrodes as a low-effort, comfortable approach to sleep
monitoring, with applications such as stopping podcasts when users fall asleep.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有算法在在线凸凹优化问题中无法提供最优性能，特别是在平稳或可预测环境中表现不佳，需要一种能够动态适应不同非平稳性水平的新方法。

Method: 设计了包含三个核心组件的模块化算法：自适应模块动态调整非平稳性水平，多预测器聚合器选择最佳预测器，集成模块有效结合各组件优势。

Result: 算法实现了最小化最优的动态对偶间隙上界（达到对数因子），同时确保了预测误差驱动的对偶间隙边界，实证结果验证了方法的有效性和适应性。

Conclusion: 该模块化算法为在线凸凹优化提供了有效的解决方案，其灵活设计允许组件替换和集成额外知识，在动态环境中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: This paper investigates the problem of Online Convex-Concave Optimization,
which extends Online Convex Optimization to two-player time-varying
convex-concave games. The goal is to minimize the dynamic duality gap (D-DGap),
a critical performance measure that evaluates players' strategies against
arbitrary comparator sequences. Existing algorithms fail to deliver optimal
performance, particularly in stationary or predictable environments. To address
this, we propose a novel modular algorithm with three core components: an
Adaptive Module that dynamically adjusts to varying levels of non-stationarity,
a Multi-Predictor Aggregator that identifies the best predictor among multiple
candidates, and an Integration Module that effectively combines their
strengths. Our algorithm achieves a minimax optimal D-DGap upper bound, up to a
logarithmic factor, while also ensuring prediction error-driven D-DGap bounds.
The modular design allows for the seamless replacement of components that
regulate adaptability to dynamic environments, as well as the incorporation of
components that integrate ``side knowledge'' from multiple predictors.
Empirical results further demonstrate the effectiveness and adaptability of the
proposed method.

Abstract: Knowledge graphs and ontologies represent entities and their relationships in
a structured way, having gained significance in the development of modern AI
applications. Integrating these semantic resources with machine learning models
often relies on knowledge graph embedding models to transform graph data into
numerical representations. Therefore, pre-trained models for popular knowledge
graphs and ontologies are increasingly valuable, as they spare the need to
retrain models for different tasks using the same data, thereby helping to
democratize AI development and enabling sustainable computing.
  In this paper, we present Bio-KGvec2go, an extension of the KGvec2go Web API,
designed to generate and serve knowledge graph embeddings for widely used
biomedical ontologies. Given the dynamic nature of these ontologies,
Bio-KGvec2go also supports regular updates aligned with ontology version
releases. By offering up-to-date embeddings with minimal computational effort
required from users, Bio-KGvec2go facilitates efficient and timely biomedical

Motivation: 传统多任务世界模型在处理大规模异构环境时存在梯度冲突和模型塑性损失问题，限制了样本和计算效率。

Method: 采用混合专家(MoE)架构缓解梯度冲突，并引入基于LoRA的动态参数缩放(DPS)策略来动态平衡计算负载。

Conclusion: ScaleZero展示了在大规模多任务学习中有效解决梯度冲突和计算效率问题的潜力，为异构多任务学习提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: In heterogeneous multi-task learning, tasks not only exhibit diverse
observation and action spaces but also vary substantially in intrinsic
difficulty. While conventional multi-task world models like UniZero excel in
single-task settings, we find that when handling large-scale heterogeneous
environments, gradient conflicts and the loss of model plasticity often
constrain their sample and computational efficiency. In this work, we address
these challenges from two perspectives: the single learning iteration and the
overall learning process. First, we investigate the impact of key design spaces
on extending UniZero to multi-task planning. We find that a Mixture-of-Experts
(MoE) architecture provides the most substantial performance gains by
mitigating gradient conflicts, leading to our proposed model,
\textit{ScaleZero}. Second, to dynamically balance the computational load
across the learning process, we introduce an online, LoRA-based \textit{dynamic
parameter scaling} (DPS) strategy. This strategy progressively integrates LoRA
adapters in response to task-specific progress, enabling adaptive knowledge
retention and parameter expansion. Empirical evaluations on standard benchmarks
such as Atari, DMControl (DMC), and Jericho demonstrate that ScaleZero, relying
exclusively on online reinforcement learning with one model, attains
performance on par with specialized single-task baselines. Furthermore, when
augmented with our dynamic parameter scaling strategy, our method achieves
competitive performance while requiring only 80\% of the single-task
environment interaction steps. These findings underscore the potential of
ScaleZero for effective large-scale multi-task learning. Our code is available
at \textcolor{magenta}{https://github.com/opendilab/LightZero}.

Method: 提出M3T联邦基础模型(FedFMs)，将联邦学习(FL)与多模态多任务基础模型相结合，支持在去中心化机构间进行协作性、隐私保护的训练

Result: 识别了M3T FedFMs在教育领域的三大关键优势：隐私保护(保持敏感数据本地化)、个性化(通过模块化架构实现定制)、公平性和包容性(支持资源受限实体参与)

Conclusion: M3T FedFMs是一种有前景但未充分探索的教育方案，本文提出了五个重要的研究挑战：异构隐私规定、数据模态特征不均匀性、去学习方法、持续学习框架和模型可解释性，需要集体解决以实现实际部署

Abstract: Multi-modal multi-task (M3T) foundation models (FMs) have recently shown
transformative potential in artificial intelligence, with emerging applications
in education. However, their deployment in real-world educational settings is
hindered by privacy regulations, data silos, and limited domain-specific data
availability. We introduce M3T Federated Foundation Models (FedFMs) for
education: a paradigm that integrates federated learning (FL) with M3T FMs to
enable collaborative, privacy-preserving training across decentralized
institutions while accommodating diverse modalities and tasks. Subsequently,
this position paper aims to unveil M3T FedFMs as a promising yet underexplored
approach to the education community, explore its potentials, and reveal its
related future research directions. We outline how M3T FedFMs can advance three
critical pillars of next-generation intelligent education systems: (i) privacy
preservation, by keeping sensitive multi-modal student and institutional data
local; (ii) personalization, through modular architectures enabling tailored
models for students, instructors, and institutions; and (iii) equity and
inclusivity, by facilitating participation from underrepresented and
resource-constrained entities. We finally identify various open research
challenges, including studying of (i) inter-institution heterogeneous privacy
regulations, (ii) the non-uniformity of data modalities' characteristics, (iii)
the unlearning approaches for M3T FedFMs, (iv) the continual learning
frameworks for M3T FedFMs, and (v) M3T FedFM model interpretability, which must
be collectively addressed for practical deployment.

Motivation: 深度神经网络对伪相关非常敏感，现有方法主要处理不完全伪相关，但对于完全伪相关的情况，正确的泛化是根本未指定的，需要新的解决方案。

Method: 提出ACE方法，学习一组与训练数据一致但在未标记新输入上做出不同预测的概念，采用自训练方法鼓励自信和选择性分歧。

Conclusion: ACE在克服未指定问题方面取得了显著进展，虽然仍有重要限制，但为处理完全伪相关问题提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Deep neural networks are notoriously sensitive to spurious correlations -
where a model learns a shortcut that fails out-of-distribution. Existing work
on spurious correlations has often focused on incomplete
correlations,leveraging access to labeled instances that break the correlation.
But in cases where the spurious correlations are complete, the correct
generalization is fundamentally \textit{underspecified}. To resolve this
underspecification, we propose learning a set of concepts that are consistent
with training data but make distinct predictions on a subset of novel unlabeled
inputs. Using a self-training approach that encourages \textit{confident} and
\textit{selective} disagreement, our method ACE matches or outperforms existing
methods on a suite of complete-spurious correlation benchmarks, while remaining
robust to incomplete spurious correlations. ACE is also more configurable than
prior approaches, allowing for straight-forward encoding of prior knowledge and
principled unsupervised model selection. In an early application to
language-model alignment, we find that ACE achieves competitive performance on
the measurement tampering detection benchmark \textit{without} access to
untrusted measurements. While still subject to important limitations, ACE
represents significant progress towards overcoming underspecification.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准注意力机制的低维投影会导致高维输入信息丢失，且对所有输入对使用相同的评分函数，缺乏对序列中相邻token的距离依赖计算偏置。

Method: 使用计算高效的高秩结构化矩阵（包括Block Tensor-Train和Multi-Level Low Rank矩阵）构建新的评分函数，能够编码全秩或距离依赖的计算偏置。

Result: 在高维输入的上下文回归任务中，在任何固定计算预算下都优于标准注意力；在语言建模任务中，MLR-based注意力相比标准注意力和滑动窗口注意力变体实现了更好的缩放规律；在长程时间序列预测中也显示出有希望的结果。

Conclusion: 提出的BTT和MLR评分函数属于更广泛的高效结构化矩阵家族，能够有效解决标准注意力的显著缺陷，为注意力机制提供了更灵活和高效的设计选择。

Abstract: The core component of attention is the scoring function, which transforms the
inputs into low-dimensional queries and keys and takes the dot product of each
pair. While the low-dimensional projection improves efficiency, it causes
information loss for certain tasks that have intrinsically high-dimensional
inputs. Additionally, attention uses the same scoring function for all input
pairs, without imposing a distance-dependent compute bias for neighboring
tokens in the sequence. In this work, we address these shortcomings by
proposing new scoring functions based on computationally efficient structured
matrices with high ranks, including Block Tensor-Train (BTT) and Multi-Level
Low Rank (MLR) matrices. On in-context regression tasks with high-dimensional
inputs, our proposed scoring functions outperform standard attention for any
fixed compute budget. On language modeling, a task that exhibits locality
patterns, our MLR-based attention method achieves improved scaling laws
compared to both standard attention and variants of sliding window attention.
Additionally, we show that both BTT and MLR fall under a broader family of
efficient structured matrices capable of encoding either full-rank or
distance-dependent compute biases, thereby addressing significant shortcomings
of standard attention. Finally, we show that MLR attention has promising
results for long-range time-series forecasting.

Motivation: 学习率预热在实践中被广泛使用且效果显著，但其理论优势尚未被充分理解，存在理论与实践之间的差距

Method: 提出新的广义光滑性假设家族，并在确定性和随机设置下研究梯度下降的收敛性质，分析预热学习率策略的效果

Result: 学习率预热能持续加速梯度下降，在某些特定情况下，带预热的梯度下降比非递增学习率调度快Θ(T)倍收敛

Conclusion: 学习率预热策略在优化理论层面具有明确的理论优势，能够显著提升梯度下降算法的收敛速度

Abstract: Learning rate warmup is a popular and practical technique in training
large-scale deep neural networks. Despite the huge success in practice, the
theoretical advantages of this strategy of gradually increasing the learning
rate at the beginning of the training process have not been fully understood.
To resolve this gap between theory and practice, we first propose a novel
family of generalized smoothness assumptions, and validate its applicability
both theoretically and empirically. Under the novel smoothness assumption, we
study the convergence properties of gradient descent (GD) in both deterministic
and stochastic settings. It is shown that learning rate warmup consistently
accelerates GD, and GD with warmup can converge at most $\Theta(T)$ times
faster than with a non-increasing learning rate schedule in some specific
cases, providing insights into the benefits of this strategy from an
optimization theory perspective.

### [178] [Persuading Agents in Opinion Formation Games](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07520)
*Martin Hoefer,Tim Koglin,Tolga Tel*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 本文在Friedkin-Johnsen意见形成模型中引入贝叶斯说服，研究发送者如何通过信息揭示来优化意见均衡，提出了多种情况下的高效算法和近似策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统意见形成模型主要关注同伴压力，但现实中意见形成还基于世界状态信息和说服努力。本文旨在分析在FJ模型中引入贝叶斯说服的方法，让发送者通过信息揭示来影响公众意见均衡。

Method: 在FJ模型中引入未知世界状态影响代理人的先入之见，发送者可以部分揭示状态信息，代理人据此更新先入之见并形成意见均衡。提出了优化发送者目标的算法，包括简单最优策略和针对范围目标的效率算法。

Result: 对于许多自然目标存在简单最优策略；在预概念矩阵常数秩或多项式范围组合情况下提供高效算法；一般情况显示次可加范围目标允许简单n近似，而可加目标的n^{1-c}近似是NP难的。

Conclusion: 贝叶斯说服可以有效地整合到意见形成模型中，为发送者提供了通过信息控制来影响公众意见的理论框架和实用算法，在不同复杂度情况下都有相应的解决方案。

Abstract: Prominent opinion formation models such as the one by Friedkin and Johnsen
(FJ) concentrate on the effects of peer pressure on public opinions. In
practice, opinion formation is also based on information about the state of the
world and persuasion efforts. In this paper, we analyze an approach of Bayesian
persuasion in the FJ model. There is an unknown state of the world that
influences the preconceptions of n agents. A sender S can (partially) reveal
information about the state to all agents. The agents update their
preconceptions, and an equilibrium of public opinions emerges. We propose
algorithms for the sender to reveal information in order to optimize various
aspects of the emerging equilibrium. For many natural sender objectives, we
show that there are simple optimal strategies. We then focus on a general class
of range-based objectives with desired opinion ranges for each agent. We
provide efficient algorithms in several cases, e.g., when the matrix of
preconceptions in all states has constant rank, or when there is only a
polynomial number of range combinations that lead to positive value for S. This
generalizes, e.g., instances with a constant number of states and/or agents, or
instances with a logarithmic number of ranges. In general, we show that
subadditive range-based objectives allow a simple n-approximation, and even for
additive ones, obtaining an $n^{1-c}$-approximation is NP-hard, for any
constant $c > 0$.

### [179] [City Sampling for Citizens' Assemblies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07557)
*Paul Gölz,Jan Maly,Ulrike Schmidt-Kraepelin,Markus Utke,Philipp C. Verpoort*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 本文研究公民大会中的两阶段抽样问题，针对德国等国家市政级存储选民信息的情况，开发多种算法确保选民等概率被选中的同时最小化联系城市数量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决公民大会实践中面临的抽样挑战：由于选民联系信息存储在市政级别，组织者只能在有限数量的城市中选择选民，同时需要确保每个选民被选中的概率相等。

Method: 提出了多种算法：基于线性规划分离预言机的伪多项式时间算法和加性1-近似算法；简单可解释的贪心算法（满足事后单调性，达到加性2-近似）；基于列生成和整数线性规划的最优算法以及创建透明分布的简单启发式算法。

Result: 在德国数据上评估了这些算法，计划与领先的非营利组织合作部署。算法能够有效平衡城市数量最小化和事后比例性等实际目标。

Conclusion: 为公民大会的抽样问题提供了实用的算法解决方案，既考虑了理论最优性，也注重实际部署的可行性和可解释性。

Abstract: In citizens' assemblies, a group of constituents is randomly selected to
weigh in on policy issues. We study a two-stage sampling problem faced by
practitioners in countries such as Germany, in which constituents' contact
information is stored at a municipal level. As a result, practitioners can only
select constituents from a bounded number of cities ex post, while ensuring
equal selection probability for constituents ex ante.
  We develop several algorithms for this problem. Although minimizing the
number of contacted cities is NP-hard, we provide a pseudo-polynomial time
algorithm and an additive 1-approximation, both based on separation oracles for
a linear programming formulation. Recognizing that practical objectives go
beyond minimizing city count, we further introduce a simple and more
interpretable greedy algorithm, which additionally satisfies an ex-post
monotonicity property and achieves an additive 2-approximation. Finally, we
explore a notion of ex-post proportionality, for which we propose two practical
algorithms: an optimal algorithm based on column generation and integer linear
programming and a simple heuristic creating particularly transparent
distributions. We evaluate these algorithms on data from Germany, and plan to
deploy them in cooperation with a leading nonprofit organization in this space.

### [180] [Inference of Intrinsic Rewards and Fairness in Multi-Agent Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07650)
*Victor Villin,Christos Dimitrakakis*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于多智能体逆强化学习的方法，通过分析智能体在马尔可夫博弈中的演示行为来推断其公平性偏好，无需显式了解其偏好信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 公平性在社会互动中至关重要，但很难在没有明确偏好知识的情况下准确理解个体的公平程度。论文旨在解决如何从行为演示中可靠推断公平性偏好的挑战。

Method: 采用多智能体逆强化学习框架，构建反映智能体对他人福利重视程度的奖励函数。引入新颖的贝叶斯策略，分析演示的最优性和一般和马尔可夫博弈中的均衡特征。

Result: 实验表明，从演示中可以可靠地推断出连贯的公平性概念。通过分离公平性成分，能够解耦理解智能体的偏好。将智能体置于不同群体中可以揭示其奖励结构的新方面，从而消除模糊性。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效回答"谁在表现公平"这一核心问题，为理解社会互动中的公平性提供了新的计算框架和分析工具。

Abstract: From altruism to antagonism, fairness plays a central role in social
interactions. But can we truly understand how fair someone is, especially
without explicit knowledge of their preferences? We cast this challenge as a
multi-agent inverse reinforcement learning problem, explicitly structuring
rewards to reflect how agents value the welfare of others. We introduce novel
Bayesian strategies, reasoning about the optimality of demonstrations and
characterisation of equilibria in general-sum Markov games. Our experiments,
spanning randomised environments and a collaborative cooking task, reveal that
coherent notions of fairness can be reliably inferred from demonstrations.
Furthermore, when isolating fairness components, we obtain a disentangled
understanding of agents preferences. Crucially, we unveil that by placing
agents in different groups, we can force them to exhibit new facets of their
reward structures, cutting through ambiguity to answer the central question:
who is being fair?

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决固定时间周期末尾快速消耗剩余预算时可能导致的超额投放问题，提高预算调节系统的稳健性和效果。

Method: 在标准Fast Finish功能基础上，根据历史广告赛事数据动态更新系统参数（如启动时间和限流速率），实现更智能的预算消耗控制。

Result: 在DoorDash平台实际部署，通过线上预算分流实验和离线模拟验证，SFF被证明是一种稳健的超额投放减缓解决方案。

Conclusion: 智能快速完成(SFF)通过动态参数调整，有效解决了预算调节中的超额投放问题，在实际应用中表现出良好的效果和稳健性。

Abstract: We present a budget pacing feature called Smart Fast Finish (SFF). SFF builds
upon the industry standard Fast Finish (FF) feature in budget pacing systems
that depletes remaining advertising budget as quickly as possible towards the
end of some fixed time period. SFF dynamically updates system parameters such
as start time and throttle rate depending on historical ad-campaign data. SFF
is currently in use at DoorDash, one of the largest delivery platforms in the
US, and is part of its budget pacing system. We show via online budget-split
experimentation data and offline simulations that SFF is a robust solution for
overdelivery mitigation when pacing budget.

### [182] [Renewable Energy Sources Selection Analysis with the Maximizing Deviation Method](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07011)
*Kirisci Murat*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种基于区间值Fermatean模糊集和偏差最大化方法的多标准决策方法，应用于可再生能源选择问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 处理多标准决策中的不确定性和模糊性，特别是在可再生能源选择这种具有技术、管理和政治含义的复杂问题中。

Method: 采用Fermatean模糊环境（模糊集的一种普遍化），建立基于偏差最大化方法的优化模型来确定部分知道的特征权重，并与区间值Fermatean模糊集结合。

Result: 方法成功应用于可再生能源选择问题，能够有效处理决策者判断中的不确定性和模糊性。

Conclusion: 该方法为复杂和不确定环境下的多标准决策提供了有效工具，尤其在具有重要管理和政治含义的可再生能源选择领域表现出良好效果。

Abstract: Multi-criteria decision-making methods provide decision-makers with
appropriate tools to make better decisions in uncertain, complex, and
conflicting situations. Fuzzy set theory primarily deals with the uncertainty
inherent in human thoughts and perceptions and attempts to quantify this
uncertainty. Fuzzy logic and fuzzy set theory are utilized with multi-criteria
decision-making methods because they effectively handle uncertainty and
fuzziness in decision-makers' judgments, allowing for verbal judgments of the
problem. This study utilizes the Fermatean fuzzy environment, a generalization
of fuzzy sets. An optimization model based on the deviation maximization method
is proposed to determine partially known feature weights. This method is
combined with interval-valued Fermatean fuzzy sets. The proposed method was
applied to the problem of selecting renewable energy sources. The reason for
choosing renewable energy sources is that meeting energy needs from renewable
sources, balancing carbon emissions, and mitigating the effects of global
climate change are among the most critical issues of the recent period. Even
though selecting renewable energy sources is a technical issue, the managerial
and political implications of this issue are also important, and are discussed
in this study.

### [183] [From Eigenmodes to Proofs: Integrating Graph Spectral Operators with Symbolic Interpretable Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07017)
*Andrew Kiruluta,Priscilla Burity*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Spectral NSR是一个完全谱神经符号推理框架，通过图信号处理和拉普拉斯特征结构将逻辑规则嵌入为谱模板，在谱域直接进行推理，统一了符号推理的可解释性和谱学习的可扩展性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决传统神经符号推理系统在可扩展性、适应性和可解释性方面的局限性，作者希望开发一个能够结合符号推理严谨性和神经网络学习能力的统一框架。

Method: 利用图信号处理和基于知识图谱拉普拉斯特征结构的频率选择性滤波器，将逻辑规则嵌入为谱模板。包含动态图和基学习、有理和扩散滤波器、谱专家混合、证明引导训练、不确定性量化等扩展功能。

Result: 在ProofWriter和CLUTRR等推理基准测试中，Spectral NSR相比transformer、消息传递神经网络和神经符号逻辑编程系统，实现了更高的准确性、更快的推理速度、更好的对抗鲁棒性和更强的可解释性。

Conclusion: Spectral NSR为下一代推理系统提供了一个可扩展且原则性的基础，提供了超越传统方法的透明度、鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: We introduce Spectral NSR, a fully spectral neuro-symbolic reasoning
framework that embeds logical rules as spectral templates and performs
inference directly in the graph spectral domain. By leveraging graph signal
processing (GSP) and frequency-selective filters grounded in the Laplacian
eigenstructure of knowledge graphs, the architecture unifies the
interpretability of symbolic reasoning with the scalability and adaptability of
spectral learning. Beyond the core formulation, we incorporate a comprehensive
set of extensions, including dynamic graph and basis learning, rational and
diffusion filters for sharper spectral selectivity, mixture-of-spectral-experts
for modular specialization, proof-guided training with spectral curricula, and
uncertainty quantification for calibrated confidence. Additional enhancements
such as large language model coupling, co-spectral transfer alignment,
adversarial robustness, efficient GPU kernels, generalized Laplacians, and
causal interventions further expand the versatility of the framework.
  Empirical evaluation on state-of-the-art reasoning benchmarks such as
ProofWriter and CLUTRR demonstrates that Spectral NSR achieves superior
accuracy, faster inference, improved robustness to adversarial perturbations,
and higher interpretability compared to leading baselines including
transformers, message-passing neural networks, and neuro-symbolic logic
programming systems. Spectral attribution and proof-band agreement analyses
confirm that model decisions align closely with symbolic proof structures,
while transfer experiments validate effective domain adaptation through
co-spectral alignment. These results establish Spectral NSR as a scalable and
principled foundation for the next generation of reasoning systems, offering
transparency, robustness, and generalization beyond conventional approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式AI技术基于概率模型采样，缺乏对正确性、安全性、公平性等属性的保证，需要统计方法来提高其可靠性。

Method: 综述性研究方法，回顾现有统计技术在生成式AI中的应用，包括通用统计方法和具体应用案例。

Result: 统计方法为生成式AI提供了提高可靠性的潜在途径，同时在AI评估质量和效率提升以及实验设计方面也显示出良好前景。

Conclusion: 统计方法对提升生成式AI的可靠性具有重要意义，但存在局限性，需要进一步研究和发展未来方向。

Abstract: Generative Artificial Intelligence is emerging as an important technology,
promising to be transformative in many areas. At the same time, generative AI
techniques are based on sampling from probabilistic models, and by default,
they come with no guarantees about correctness, safety, fairness, or other
properties. Statistical methods offer a promising potential approach to improve
the reliability of generative AI techniques. In addition, statistical methods
are also promising for improving the quality and efficiency of AI evaluation,
as well as for designing interventions and experiments in AI.
  In this paper, we review some of the existing work on these topics,
explaining both the general statistical techniques used, as well as their
applications to generative AI. We also discuss limitations and potential future
directions.

*Yinheng Li,Hailey Hultquist,Justin Wagle,Kazuhito Koishida*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Instruction Agent是一个GUI代理，通过专家演示学习逐步指令并严格执行用户预期轨迹，结合验证器和回溯器模块处理意外中断，在复杂任务上达到60%成功率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前GUI代理在处理新颖UI元素、长时程动作和个性化轨迹的复杂任务时仍存在困难，需要一种能够利用专家演示来解决这类挑战性工作流程的方法

Method: 给定单个演示，代理提取逐步指令并严格遵循用户预期轨迹执行；使用验证器模块理解每个动作的当前结果，回溯器模块处理执行过程中的意外中断（如弹出窗口）

Result: 在OSWorld任务集上达到60%的成功率，所有顶级代理此前均未能完成这些任务

Conclusion: Instruction Agent提供了一个实用且可扩展的框架，弥合了当前GUI代理与可靠真实世界GUI任务自动化之间的差距

Abstract: Graphical user interface (GUI) agents have advanced rapidly but still
struggle with complex tasks involving novel UI elements, long-horizon actions,
and personalized trajectories. In this work, we introduce Instruction Agent, a
GUI agent that leverages expert demonstrations to solve such tasks, enabling
completion of otherwise difficult workflows. Given a single demonstration, the
agent extracts step-by-step instructions and executes them by strictly
following the trajectory intended by the user, which avoids making mistakes
during execution. The agent leverages the verifier and backtracker modules
further to improve robustness. Both modules are critical to understand the
current outcome from each action and handle unexpected interruptions(such as
pop-up windows) during execution. Our experiments show that Instruction Agent
achieves a 60% success rate on a set of tasks in OSWorld that all top-ranked
agents failed to complete. The Instruction Agent offers a practical and
extensible framework, bridging the gap between current GUI agents and reliable
real-world GUI task automation.

*Jakub Grudzien Kuba,Mengting Gu,Qi Ma,Yuandong Tian,Vijai Mohan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出Language Self-Play (LSP)方法，通过自我博弈的强化学习让语言模型无需额外数据就能自我提升性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型发展面临的数据依赖瓶颈，避免对海量训练数据的持续需求

Method: 基于博弈论的自博弈框架，将模型能力视为竞争游戏中的表现，通过模型与自己博弈来产生更强的策略

Result: 在Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct上的实验显示，仅通过自博弈就能提升指令跟随任务的性能，且效果优于数据驱动的基线方法

Conclusion: 自博弈强化学习是突破数据依赖瓶颈的有效途径，使预训练模型能够在不依赖额外数据的情况下持续提升能力

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have advanced rapidly in recent years, driven by
scale, abundant high-quality training data, and reinforcement learning. Yet
this progress faces a fundamental bottleneck: the need for ever more data from
which models can continue to learn. In this work, we propose a reinforcement
learning approach that removes this dependency by enabling models to improve
without additional data. Our method leverages a game-theoretic framework of
self-play, where a model's capabilities are cast as performance in a
competitive game and stronger policies emerge by having the model play against
itself - a process we call Language Self-Play (LSP). Experiments with
Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct on instruction-following benchmarks show that pretrained
models can not only enhance their performance on challenging tasks through
self-play alone, but can also do so more effectively than data-driven
baselines.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文分析了现有神经符号框架的技术特征，包括符号表示语言、神经模型集成和算法，并展示了三个典型框架的特点与挑战


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经符号框架结合了符号处理的推理能力、可解释性和神经计算的灵活性，但缺乏用户友好工具和统一框架，需要系统性分析

Result: 识别了各框架在解决不同问题时的表达能力挑战，为评估框架性能提供了基础

Conclusion: 研究为神经符号学习领域的发展提供了重要见解，期待引发社区对该问题的新新思考和转型行动

Abstract: Neurosymbolic (NeSy) frameworks combine neural representations and learning
with symbolic representations and reasoning. Combining the reasoning
capacities, explainability, and interpretability of symbolic processing with
the flexibility and power of neural computing allows us to solve complex
problems with more reliability while being data-efficient. However, this
recently growing topic poses a challenge to developers with its learning curve,
lack of user-friendly tools, libraries, and unifying frameworks. In this paper,
we characterize the technical facets of existing NeSy frameworks, such as the
symbolic representation language, integration with neural models, and the
underlying algorithms. A majority of the NeSy research focuses on algorithms
instead of providing generic frameworks for declarative problem specification
to leverage problem solving. To highlight the key aspects of Neurosymbolic
modeling, we showcase three generic NeSy frameworks - \textit{DeepProbLog},
\textit{Scallop}, and \textit{DomiKnowS}. We identify the challenges within
each facet that lay the foundation for identifying the expressivity of each
framework in solving a variety of problems. Building on this foundation, we aim
to spark transformative action and encourage the community to rethink this
problem in novel ways.

### [188] [Autoencoder-Based Denoising of Muscle Artifacts in ECG to Preserve Skin Nerve Activity (SKNA) for Cognitive Stress Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07146)
*Farnoush Baghestani,Jihye Moon,Youngsun Kong,Ki Chon*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出基于一维卷积自编码器和LSTM的深度学习方法来去除皮肤神经活动(SKNA)信号中的肌电(EMG)噪声，显著提高信号质量，使在运动丰富的自然环境中进行稳健的SKNA监测成为可能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 皮肤神经活动(SKNA)是监测交感神经系统(SNS)的非侵入性方法，但容易受到肌电(EMG)污染。传统的带通滤波方法在持续肌肉活动时效果不佳，因为EMG和SKNA的频谱成分会重叠。

Method: 使用轻量级一维卷积自编码器配合LSTM瓶颈层，从EMG污染的记录中重建干净的SKNA信号。采用留一受试者交叉验证框架，使用认知压力实验的干净SKNA数据和混沌肌肉刺激记录的EMG噪声进行训练。

Result: 方法将信噪比提高了9.65 dB，与干净SKNA的互相关系数从0.40增加到0.72，基于爆发的SKNA特征恢复到接近干净的判别能力(AUROC ≥ 0.96)。在严重噪声水平下，基线状态与交感神经刺激状态的分类准确率达到91-98%。

Conclusion: 深度学习重建方法能够在大量EMG干扰下保留生理相关的交感神经爆发，为在自然主义、运动丰富的环境中进行更稳健的SKNA监测提供了可能。

Abstract: The sympathetic nervous system (SNS) plays a central role in regulating the
body's responses to stress and maintaining physiological stability. Its
dysregulation is associated with a wide range of conditions, from
cardiovascular disease to anxiety disorders. Skin nerve activity (SKNA)
extracted from high-frequency electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings provides a
noninvasive window into SNS dynamics, but its measurement is highly susceptible
to electromyographic (EMG) contamination. Traditional preprocessing based on
bandpass filtering within a fixed range (e.g., 500--1000 Hz) is susceptible to
overlapping EMG and SKNA spectral components, especially during sustained
muscle activity. We present a denoising approach using a lightweight
one-dimensional convolutional autoencoder with a long short-term memory (LSTM)
bottleneck to reconstruct clean SKNA from EMG-contaminated recordings. Using
clean ECG-derived SKNA data from cognitive stress experiments and EMG noise
from chaotic muscle stimulation recordings, we simulated contamination at
realistic noise levels (--4 dB, --8 dB signal-to-noise ratio) and trained the
model in the leave-one-subject-out cross-validation framework. The method
improved signal-to-noise ratio by up to 9.65 dB, increased cross correlation
with clean SKNA from 0.40 to 0.72, and restored burst-based SKNA features to
near-clean discriminability (AUROC $\geq$ 0.96). Classification of baseline
versus sympathetic stimulation (cognitive stress) conditions reached accuracies
of 91--98\% across severe noise levels, comparable to clean data. These results
demonstrate that deep learning--based reconstruction can preserve
physiologically relevant sympathetic bursts during substantial EMG
interference, enabling more robust SKNA monitoring in naturalistic,
movement-rich environments.

*Heng Hao,Wenjun Hu,Oxana Verkholyak,Davoud Ataee Tarzanagh,Baruch Gutow,Sima Didari,Masoud Faraki,Hankyu Moon,Seungjai Min*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PaVeRL-SQL是一个结合部分匹配奖励和语言强化学习的框架，通过两种管道（语言RL和CoT RL）在Text-to-SQL任务上实现了最先进的性能，特别是在工业级数据库上表现突出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前Text-to-SQL方法在工业级数据库和涉及领域特定业务逻辑的复杂问题上执行准确率较低，需要更有效的解决方案来处理实际用例。

Method: 采用两种管道：1）新设计的上下文学习框架与群体自评估（语言RL），使用开源和闭源大语言模型作为骨干；2）思维链RL管道，使用小型骨干模型（OmniSQL-7B）配合专门设计的奖励函数和两阶段RL训练。

Result: 在Spider、Spider 2.0和BIRD基准测试中达到最先进结果。在工业级Spider2.0-SQLite基准上，语言RL管道比SOTA高7.4%，CoT管道高1.4%。混合SQL方言的RL训练带来三倍增益。

Conclusion: PaVeRL-SQL在现实工业约束下提供了可靠的最先进Text-to-SQL解决方案，代码已开源。

Abstract: Text-to-SQL models allow users to interact with a database more easily by
generating executable SQL statements from natural-language questions. Despite
recent successes on simpler databases and questions, current Text-to-SQL
methods still suffer from low execution accuracy on industry-scale databases
and complex questions involving domain-specific business logic. We present
\emph{PaVeRL-SQL}, a framework that combines \emph{Partial-Match Rewards} and
\emph{Verbal Reinforcement Learning} to drive self-improvement in reasoning
language models (RLMs) for Text-to-SQL. To handle practical use cases, we adopt
two pipelines: (1) a newly designed in-context learning framework with group
self-evaluation (verbal-RL), using capable open- and closed-source large
language models (LLMs) as backbones; and (2) a chain-of-thought (CoT) RL
pipeline with a small backbone model (OmniSQL-7B) trained with a specially
designed reward function and two-stage RL. These pipelines achieve
state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on popular Text-to-SQL benchmarks -- Spider,
Spider 2.0, and BIRD. For the industrial-level Spider2.0-SQLite benchmark, the
verbal-RL pipeline achieves an execution accuracy 7.4\% higher than SOTA, and
the CoT pipeline is 1.4\% higher. RL training with mixed SQL dialects yields
strong, threefold gains, particularly for dialects with limited training data.
Overall, \emph{PaVeRL-SQL} delivers reliable, SOTA Text-to-SQL under realistic
industrial constraints. The code is available at
https://github.com/PaVeRL-SQL/PaVeRL-SQL.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: FETCH分类器用于法律问题分类，通过混合LLM/ML集成方法和自动生成后续问题来提高准确性，在真实数据集上达到97.37%的准确率，优于GPT-5模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 每年数百万人通过法律援助热线寻求帮助，错误分类可能导致严重后果（错过截止日期、遭受虐待、失去住房或子女监护权），需要准确的法律问题分类来匹配正确的法律援助。

Method: 采用混合LLM/ML集成分类方法，自动生成后续问题来丰富初始问题叙述，使用包含419个真实查询的新数据集进行训练和评估。

Result: 分类准确率（hits@2）达到97.37%，使用低成本模型组合超越了当前最先进的GPT-5模型的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法在显著降低法律系统用户引导成本的同时实现了高准确性，有望改善法律援助的匹配效率。

Abstract: Each year millions of people seek help for their legal problems by calling a
legal aid program hotline, walking into a legal aid office, or using a lawyer
referral service. The first step to match them to the right help is to identify
the legal problem the applicant is experiencing. Misdirection has consequences.
Applicants may miss a deadline, experience physical abuse, lose housing or lose
custody of children while waiting to connect to the right legal help. We
introduce and evaluate the FETCH classifier for legal issue classification and
describe two methods for improving accuracy: a hybrid LLM/ML ensemble
classification method, and the automatic generation of follow-up questions to
enrich the initial problem narrative. We employ a novel data set of 419
real-world queries to a nonprofit lawyer referral service. Ultimately, we show
classification accuracy (hits@2) of 97.37\% using a mix of inexpensive models,
exceeding the performance of the current state-of-the-art GPT-5 model. Our
approach shows promise in significantly reducing the cost of guiding users of
the legal system to the right resource for their problem while achieving high
accuracy.

TL;DR: 提出基于CNN-LSTM混合深度学习的入侵检测系统，用于智能电网安全防护，达到99.70%的检测准确率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 智能电网集成可再生能源和现代通信技术，但SCADA协议存在安全漏洞，容易受到非授权访问和拒绝服务攻击

Method: 采用CNN网络进行特征提取，结合LSTM网络识别时序模式，构建CNN-LSTM混合模型，使用DNP3和IEC104入侵检测数据集进衈训练和测试

Result: 与其他深度学习方法相比，在准确率、精确率、召回率和F1分数方面显著提升，检测准确率达到99.70%

Conclusion: 证明了混合深度学习模型在智能电网安全中的有效性，为防范网络攻提供了可靠的技术方案

Abstract: The evolution of the traditional power grid into the "smart grid" has
resulted in a fundamental shift in energy management, which allows the
integration of renewable energy sources with modern communication technology.
However, this interconnection has increased smart grids' vulnerability to
attackers, which might result in privacy breaches, operational interruptions,
and massive outages. The SCADA-based smart grid protocols are critical for
real-time data collection and control, but they are vulnerable to attacks like
unauthorized access and denial of service (DoS). This research proposes a
hybrid deep learning-based Intrusion Detection System (IDS) intended to improve
the cybersecurity of smart grids. The suggested model takes advantage of
Convolutional Neural Networks' (CNN) feature extraction capabilities as well as
Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks' temporal pattern recognition skills.
DNP3 and IEC104 intrusion detection datasets are employed to train and test our
CNN-LSTM model to recognize and classify the potential cyber threats. Compared
to other deep learning approaches, the results demonstrate considerable
improvements in accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, with a detection

TL;DR: BlendedNet是一个包含999个混合翼体几何形状的公开空气动力学数据集，包含8830个RANS模拟案例，并提出了基于PointNet和FiLM网络的端到端代理模型框架，用于点状空气动力学预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决非常规构型（如混合翼体）空气动力学数据稀缺问题，为数据驱动的空气动力学设计代理建模研究提供支持。

Method: 通过采样几何设计参数和飞行条件生成数据集，使用PointNet回归器从表面点云预测几何参数，然后通过FiLM网络结合预测参数和飞行条件来预测点状系数Cp、Cfx和Cfz。

Result: 实验显示在不同混合翼体上的表面预测误差较低，数据集包含8830个收敛的RANS案例，每个案例有9-14百万个网格单元。

Conclusion: BlendedNet解决了非常规构型的数据稀缺问题，为空气动力学设计的数据驱动代理建模研究提供了重要资源。

Abstract: BlendedNet is a publicly available aerodynamic dataset of 999 blended wing
body (BWB) geometries. Each geometry is simulated across about nine flight
conditions, yielding 8830 converged RANS cases with the Spalart-Allmaras model
and 9 to 14 million cells per case. The dataset is generated by sampling
geometric design parameters and flight conditions, and includes detailed
pointwise surface quantities needed to study lift and drag. We also introduce
an end-to-end surrogate framework for pointwise aerodynamic prediction. The
pipeline first uses a permutation-invariant PointNet regressor to predict
geometric parameters from sampled surface point clouds, then conditions a
Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM) network on the predicted parameters and
flight conditions to predict pointwise coefficients Cp, Cfx, and Cfz.
Experiments show low errors in surface predictions across diverse BWBs.
BlendedNet addresses data scarcity for unconventional configurations and
enables research on data-driven surrogate modeling for aerodynamic design.

Conclusion: 小型语言模型虽然存在不足，但是一种有前景的隐私保护健康监测方案，有望成为下一代移动健康监洞技术的核心

Abstract: Mobile and wearable healthcare monitoring play a vital role in facilitating
timely interventions, managing chronic health conditions, and ultimately
improving individuals' quality of life. Previous studies on large language
models (LLMs) have highlighted their impressive generalization abilities and
effectiveness in healthcare prediction tasks. However, most LLM-based
healthcare solutions are cloud-based, which raises significant privacy concerns
and results in increased memory usage and latency. To address these challenges,
there is growing interest in compact models, Small Language Models (SLMs),
which are lightweight and designed to run locally and efficiently on mobile and
wearable devices. Nevertheless, how well these models perform in healthcare
prediction remains largely unexplored. We systematically evaluated SLMs on
health prediction tasks using zero-shot, few-shot, and instruction fine-tuning
approaches, and deployed the best performing fine-tuned SLMs on mobile devices
to evaluate their real-world efficiency and predictive performance in practical
healthcare scenarios. Our results show that SLMs can achieve performance
comparable to LLMs while offering substantial gains in efficiency and privacy.
However, challenges remain, particularly in handling class imbalance and
few-shot scenarios. These findings highlight SLMs, though imperfect in their
current form, as a promising solution for next-generation, privacy-preserving
healthcare monitoring.

Motivation: 批判性考察中间令牌生成机制，识别对中间思维链长度与问题难度关系的误解，挖掘真正的机制

Method: 使用A* 搜索算法的推导迹迹训练变换器模型，通过迹迹长度精确量化问题复杂度，在简单和分布外问题上系统评估

Result: 模型在简单任务中也产生过长迹迹或失败，中间令牌长度与A* 真实迹迹长度相关性弱，仅在训练分布附近问题中出现相关

Conclusion: 中间迹迹生成并非适应问题难度，而是受训练数据分布影响，应谨慎解释过长思维链作为"思考努力"的标志

Abstract: Intermediate token generation (ITG), where a model produces output before the
solution, has been proposed as a method to improve the performance of language
models on reasoning tasks. While these reasoning traces or Chain of Thoughts
(CoTs) are correlated with performance gains, the mechanisms underlying them
remain unclear. A prevailing assumption in the community has been to
anthropomorphize these tokens as "thinking", treating longer traces as evidence
of higher problem-adaptive computation. In this work, we critically examine
whether intermediate token sequence length reflects or correlates with problem
difficulty. To do so, we train transformer models from scratch on derivational
traces of the A* search algorithm, where the number of operations required to
solve a maze problem provides a precise and verifiable measure of problem
complexity. We first evaluate the models on trivial free-space problems,
finding that even for the simplest tasks, they often produce excessively long
reasoning traces and sometimes fail to generate a solution. We then
systematically evaluate the model on out-of-distribution problems and find that
the intermediate token length and ground truth A* trace length only loosely
correlate. We notice that the few cases where correlation appears are those
where the problems are closer to the training distribution, suggesting that the
effect arises from approximate recall rather than genuine problem-adaptive
computation. This suggests that the inherent computational complexity of the
problem instance is not a significant factor, but rather its distributional
distance from the training data. These results challenge the assumption that
intermediate trace generation is adaptive to problem difficulty and caution
against interpreting longer sequences in systems like R1 as automatically
indicative of "thinking effort".

Motivation: 受AlphaEvolve启发，但AlphaEvolve仅限于数百行代码的孤立内核，需要扩展到包含数百个文件和数万行代码的完整代码库规模。

Method: SATLUTION框架协调LLM代理在严格正确性保证和分布式运行时反馈下直接进化求解器代码库，同时自我进化其进化策略和规则。

Result: 从SAT Competition 2024代码库开始，SATLUTION进化的求解器在SAT Competition 2025中明显优于人类设计的获胜者，并在2024基准测试中超越了2024和2025年的冠军。

Conclusion: 该工作成功将LLM代码进化扩展到完整代码库规模，在复杂的SAT求解器开发中展示了超越人类专家的能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently shown strong coding abilities,
enabling not only static code generation but also iterative code self-evolving
through agentic frameworks. Recently, AlphaEvolve \cite{novikov2025alphaevolve}
demonstrated that LLM-based coding agents can autonomously improve algorithms
and surpass human experts, with scopes limited to isolated kernels spanning
hundreds of lines of code. Inspired by AlphaEvolve, we present SATLUTION, the
first framework to extend LLM-based code evolution to the full repository
scale, encompassing hundreds of files and tens of thousands of lines of C/C++
code. Targeting Boolean Satisfiability (SAT), the canonical NP-complete problem
and a cornerstone of both theory and applications. SATLUTION orchestrates LLM
agents to directly evolve solver repositories under strict correctness
guarantees and distributed runtime feedback, while simultaneously self-evolving
its own evolution policies and rules. Starting from SAT Competition 2024
codebases and benchmark, SATLUTION evolved solvers that decisively outperformed
the human-designed winners of the SAT Competition 2025, and also surpassed both
2024 and 2025 champions on the 2024 benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电子表格布局设计需要大量时间和专业知识，现有自动化布局模型无法处理电子表格特有的离散网格结构和数据依赖关系等语义关联。

Method: 使用多模态大语言模型(MLLMs)，结合规则反射和视觉反射进行组件放置和内容填充，无需训练即可生成电子表格布局。

Result: 在3,326个电子表格数据集上，SheetDesigner比5个基线方法至少提升22.6%，通过视觉模态能很好地处理重叠和平衡问题。

Conclusion: 多模态大语言模型在电子表格布局生成中表现出色，但需要结合规则和视觉反射策略来解决对齐问题，为自动化电子表格设计提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Spreadsheets are critical to data-centric tasks, with rich, structured
layouts that enable efficient information transmission. Given the time and
expertise required for manual spreadsheet layout design, there is an urgent
need for automated solutions. However, existing automated layout models are
ill-suited to spreadsheets, as they often (1) treat components as axis-aligned
rectangles with continuous coordinates, overlooking the inherently discrete,
grid-based structure of spreadsheets; and (2) neglect interrelated semantics,
such as data dependencies and contextual links, unique to spreadsheets. In this
paper, we first formalize the spreadsheet layout generation task, supported by
a seven-criterion evaluation protocol and a dataset of 3,326 spreadsheets. We
then introduce SheetDesigner, a zero-shot and training-free framework using
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) that combines rule and vision
reflection for component placement and content population. SheetDesigner
outperforms five baselines by at least 22.6\%. We further find that through
vision modality, MLLMs handle overlap and balance well but struggle with
alignment, necessitates hybrid rule and visual reflection strategies. Our codes
and data is available at Github.

Abstract: The integration of Deep Learning (DL) in System Dynamics (SD) modeling for
transportation logistics offers significant advantages in scalability and
predictive accuracy. However, these gains are often offset by the loss of
explainability and causal reliability $-$ key requirements in critical
decision-making systems. This paper presents a novel framework for
interpretable-by-design neural system dynamics modeling that synergizes DL with
techniques from Concept-Based Interpretability, Mechanistic Interpretability,
and Causal Machine Learning. The proposed hybrid approach enables the
construction of neural network models that operate on semantically meaningful
and actionable variables, while retaining the causal grounding and transparency
typical of traditional SD models. The framework is conceived to be applied to
real-world case-studies from the EU-funded project AutoMoTIF, focusing on
data-driven decision support, automation, and optimization of multimodal
logistic terminals. We aim at showing how neuro-symbolic methods can bridge the
gap between black-box predictive models and the need for critical decision
support in complex dynamical environments within cyber-physical systems enabled
by the industrial Internet-of-Things.

Motivation: 解决白盒/灰盒方法不实用和黑盒方法转移性差的问题，提高直接提示注入攻击的效果

Method: 使用代理模型激活值构建能量模型(EBM)评估对手提示质量，通过token级MCMC采样适应性优化对手提示

Result: 在5个主流LLM上达到49.6%攻击成功率，比人工制作提示提高34.6%，在未见任务上保持36.6%成功率

Conclusion: 激活值与攻击效果相关，语义模式在转移性漏洞利用中发挥关键作用

Abstract: Direct Prompt Injection (DPI) attacks pose a critical security threat to
Large Language Models (LLMs) due to their low barrier of execution and high
potential damage. To address the impracticality of existing white-box/gray-box
methods and the poor transferability of black-box methods, we propose an
activations-guided prompt injection attack framework. We first construct an
Energy-based Model (EBM) using activations from a surrogate model to evaluate
the quality of adversarial prompts. Guided by the trained EBM, we employ the
token-level Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling to adaptively optimize
adversarial prompts, thereby enabling gradient-free black-box attacks.
Experimental results demonstrate our superior cross-model transferability,
achieving 49.6% attack success rate (ASR) across five mainstream LLMs and 34.6%
improvement over human-crafted prompts, and maintaining 36.6% ASR on unseen
task scenarios. Interpretability analysis reveals a correlation between
activations and attack effectiveness, highlighting the critical role of
semantic patterns in transferable vulnerability exploitation.

Conclusion: LLM ATLAS框架为解决组织采用LLM时的对齐问题提供了理论基础和实践指导，有助于缓解信息不对称和黑盒问题

Abstract: Adopting Large language models (LLMs) in organizations potentially
revolutionizes our lives and work. However, they can generate off-topic,
discriminating, or harmful content. This AI alignment problem often stems from
misspecifications during the LLM adoption, unnoticed by the principal due to
the LLM's black-box nature. While various research disciplines investigated AI
alignment, they neither address the information asymmetries between
organizational adopters and black-box LLM agents nor consider organizational AI
adoption processes. Therefore, we propose LLM ATLAS (LLM Agency Theory-Led
Alignment Strategy) a conceptual framework grounded in agency (contract)
theory, to mitigate alignment problems during organizational LLM adoption. We
conduct a conceptual literature analysis using the organizational LLM adoption
phases and the agency theory as concepts. Our approach results in (1) providing
an extended literature analysis process specific to AI alignment methods during
organizational LLM adoption and (2) providing a first LLM alignment
problem-solution space.

Motivation: 现有神经符号AI框架（如DeepProbLog）采用固定的神经处理在前、符号推理在后的流程，无法处理复杂依赖关系，特别是在图等不规则数据结构中表现受限。

Method: 提出DeepGraphLog框架，将符号表示视为图，使用图神经网络（GNNs）进行处理，允许神经和符号组件以任意顺序分层组合，实现多层神经符号推理。

Conclusion: DeepGraphLog通过将神经符号AI扩展到图结构领域，提供了一个更具表达力和灵活性的神经符号集成框架。

Abstract: Neurosymbolic AI (NeSy) aims to integrate the statistical strengths of neural
networks with the interpretability and structure of symbolic reasoning.
However, current NeSy frameworks like DeepProbLog enforce a fixed flow where
symbolic reasoning always follows neural processing. This restricts their
ability to model complex dependencies, especially in irregular data structures
such as graphs. In this work, we introduce DeepGraphLog, a novel NeSy framework
that extends ProbLog with Graph Neural Predicates. DeepGraphLog enables
multi-layer neural-symbolic reasoning, allowing neural and symbolic components
to be layered in arbitrary order. In contrast to DeepProbLog, which cannot
handle symbolic reasoning via neural methods, DeepGraphLog treats symbolic
representations as graphs, enabling them to be processed by Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs). We showcase the capabilities of DeepGraphLog on tasks in
planning, knowledge graph completion with distant supervision, and GNN
expressivity. Our results demonstrate that DeepGraphLog effectively captures
complex relational dependencies, overcoming key limitations of existing NeSy
systems. By broadening the applicability of neurosymbolic AI to
graph-structured domains, DeepGraphLog offers a more expressive and flexible
framework for neural-symbolic integration.

Motivation: 大型语言模型在推理时容易生成错误内容，现有自校正方法存在两个根本问题：缺乏可靠的错误定位信号，以及受限于传统next-token解码的推理深度限制

Method: Feedback-Triggered Regeneration (FTR)框架：1) 仅在收到用户负反馈时激活响应再生，避免错误自评估导致的错误传播；2) Long-Term Multipath (LTM)解码，通过延迟序列评估实现多推理路径的系统性探索

Result: 在数学推理和代码生成基准测试中，该方法相比最先进的基于提示的自校正方法取得了持续且显著的改进

Conclusion: FTR框架通过结合用户反馈和增强解码机制，有效解决了LLM自校正的两个关键限制，显著提升了模型性能

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance across
diverse tasks, yet their susceptibility to generating incorrect content during
inference remains a critical unsolved challenge. While self-correction methods
offer potential solutions, their effectiveness is hindered by two inherent
limitations: (1) the absence of reliable guidance signals for error
localization, and (2) the restricted reasoning depth imposed by conventional
next-token decoding paradigms. To address these issues, we propose
Feedback-Triggered Regeneration (FTR), a novel framework that synergizes user
feedback with enhanced decoding dynamics. Specifically, FTR activates response
regeneration only upon receiving negative user feedback, thereby circumventing
error propagation from faulty self-assessment while preserving originally
correct outputs. Furthermore, we introduce Long-Term Multipath (LTM) decoding,
which enables systematic exploration of multiple reasoning trajectories through
delayed sequence evaluation, effectively overcoming the myopic decision-making
characteristic of standard next-token prediction. Extensive experiments on
mathematical reasoning and code generation benchmarks demonstrate that our
framework achieves consistent and significant improvements over
state-of-the-art prompt-based self-correction methods.

TL;DR: RIMO是一个新的数学奥林匹克竞赛基准测试，包含两个轨道：RIMO-N（335个有唯一整数答案的问题）和RIMO-P（456个需要证明的问题），旨在消除评估噪声并提供高分辨率的能力评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有奥林匹克级别基准测试存在评分噪声和潜在偏差，如异构答案格式需要模型判断、依赖可能有缺陷的解决方案等，需要开发更可靠的评估方法。

Method: 创建两个轨道：RIMO-N重写IMO问题为有唯一整数答案的形式，实现确定性正确性检查；RIMO-P提供专家检查的证明问题，分解为子问题序列，通过自动化评分系统评估逐步推理过程。

Result: 对10个前沿LLM（包括GPT-4o和Gemini 2.5 Flash）的测试显示，虽然这些系统在旧基准上表现优异，但在RIMO上性能急剧下降，揭示了当前LLM能力与实际奥林匹克级别推理之间的巨大差距。

Conclusion: RIMO提供了一个具有挑战性且易于评估的测试套件，为未来研究提供了高分辨率的衡量标准，揭示了需要解决的深刻推理差距。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) reach high scores on established mathematical
benchmarks, such as GSM8K and MATH, the research community has turned to
International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) problems to push the evaluation
frontier. However, existing Olympiad-level benchmarks suffer from practical
constraints that introduce grading noise and potential bias, such as
heterogeneous answer formats requiring model-based judges and a reliance on
potentially flawed solutions. We introduce RIMO, a two-track benchmark designed
to preserve peak Olympiad difficulty while eliminating this evaluation noise.
The first track, RIMO-N, rewrites 335 IMO problems to admit a single, unique
integer answer, allowing for deterministic correctness checking. The second
track, RIMO-P, features 456 proof problems with expert-checked solutions, which
are decomposed into a sequence of sub-problems to evaluate the step-by-step
reasoning process via an automated grading system. Our benchmarking of ten
frontier LLMs, including GPT-4o and Gemini 2.5 Flash, reveals that while these
systems excel on older benchmarks, their performance drops sharply on RIMO.
These results highlight a substantial gap between current LLM capabilities and
actual Olympiad-level reasoning. By providing a challenging yet
easy-to-evaluate suite, RIMO offers a high-resolution yardstick for future
research, presenting a clear target for closing the profound reasoning gap our
findings expose.

Conclusion: BDPM框架通过创新的特征选择和混合建模方法，为基于肠道微生物组的帕金森病诊断提供了更鲁棒和可解释的解决方案

Abstract: Background: Parkinson's disease remains a major neurodegenerative disorder
with high misdiagnosis rates, primarily due to reliance on clinical rating
scales. Recent studies have demonstrated a strong association between gut
microbiota and Parkinson's disease, suggesting that microbial composition may
serve as a promising biomarker. Although deep learning models based ongut
microbiota show potential for early prediction, most approaches rely on single
classifiers and often overlook inter-strain correlations or temporal dynamics.
Therefore, there is an urgent need for more robust feature extraction methods
tailored to microbiome data. Methods: We proposed BDPM (A Machine
Learning-Based Feature Extractor for Parkinson's Disease Classification via Gut
Microbiota Analysis). First, we collected gut microbiota profiles from 39
Parkinson's patients and their healthy spouses to identify differentially
abundant taxa. Second, we developed an innovative feature selection framework
named RFRE (Random Forest combined with Recursive Feature Elimination),
integrating ecological knowledge to enhance biological interpretability.
Finally, we designed a hybrid classification model to capture temporal and
spatial patterns in microbiome data.

Conclusion: 该方法能够通过AI技术提供更可访的碳踹迹估算，但仍面临数据库不确定性和AI误解等挑战

Abstract: Environmental sustainability, particularly in relation to climate change, is
a key concern for consumers, producers, and policymakers. The carbon footprint,
based on greenhouse gas emissions, is a standard metric for quantifying the
contribution to climate change of activities and is often assessed using life
cycle assessment (LCA). However, conducting LCA is complex due to opaque and
global supply chains, as well as fragmented data. This paper presents a
methodology that combines advances in LCA and publicly available databases with
knowledge-augmented AI techniques, including retrieval-augmented generation, to
estimate cradle-to-gate carbon footprints of food products. We introduce a
chatbot interface that allows users to interactively explore the carbon impact
of composite meals and relate the results to familiar activities. A live web
demonstration showcases our proof-of-concept system with arbitrary food items
and follow-up questions, highlighting both the potential and limitations - such
as database uncertainties and AI misinterpretations - of delivering LCA
insights in an accessible format.

### [207] [Certainty-Guided Reasoning in Large Language Models: A Dynamic Thinking Budget Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07820)
*João Paulo Nogueira,Wentao Sun,Alonso Silva,Laith Zumot*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出Certainty-Guided Reasoning (CGR)方法，通过批评模型自我评估推理置信度来动态调整推理过程，在保证准确性的同时显著减少计算资源消耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理语言模型(LRLMs)在解决复杂任务时通常使用固定的推理token预算，但这种方法无法根据具体问题的难度动态调整资源分配，可能导致资源浪费或推理不足。

Method: 受GAN生成器/判别器框架启发，使用批评模型定期评估自身推理置信度。当置信度达到目标阈值时提前终止推理，否则继续推理，实现效率与可靠性的自适应平衡。

Result: 在AIME2024和AIME2025数据集上，CGR提高了基线准确率同时减少token使用量。64次多种子实验显示方法稳定，降低方差，在惩罚性评分下表现更好。可节省数百万token，在置信度阈值和效率间提供可调节权衡。

Conclusion: 置信度是推理充分性的有效信号，CGR通过将置信度整合到推理过程中，使大型推理语言模型更加自适应、可信赖和资源高效，为在实际部署中平衡准确性和计算成本提供了可行路径。

Abstract: The rise of large reasoning language models (LRLMs) has unlocked new
potential for solving complex tasks. These models operate with a thinking
budget, that is, a predefined number of reasoning tokens used to arrive at a
solution. We propose a novel approach, inspired by the generator/discriminator
framework in generative adversarial networks, in which a critic model
periodically probes its own reasoning to assess whether it has reached a
confident conclusion. If not, reasoning continues until a target certainty
threshold is met. This mechanism adaptively balances efficiency and reliability
by allowing early termination when confidence is high, while encouraging
further reasoning when uncertainty persists. Through experiments on the
AIME2024 and AIME2025 datasets, we show that Certainty-Guided Reasoning (CGR)
improves baseline accuracy while reducing token usage. Importantly, extended
multi-seed evaluations over 64 runs demonstrate that CGR is stable, reducing
variance across seeds and improving exam-like performance under penalty-based
grading. Additionally, our token savings analysis shows that CGR can eliminate
millions of tokens in aggregate, with tunable trade-offs between certainty
thresholds and efficiency. Together, these findings highlight certainty as a
powerful signal for reasoning sufficiency. By integrating confidence into the
reasoning process, CGR makes large reasoning language models more adaptive,
trustworthy, and resource efficient, paving the way for practical deployment in
domains where both accuracy and computational cost matter.

*Amay Jain,Liu Cui,Si Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究比较了矩阵基础检索和图基础检索两种RAG方案在教学环境中的表现，发现矩阵检索适合低成本事实查询，图检索更适合主题性查询，建议采用动态分支框架以优化效果和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决ChatGPT等大语言模型在教室中提供过时或虚构信息的问题，通过RAG技术基于外部资源提高回答的可靠性。

Method: 使用EduScopeQA数据集（包含3,176个跨学科问题），比较OpenAI矩阵检索RAG和GraphRAG在不同教育查询类型上的表现，包括使用系统性修改的教科书进行测试。

Result: 矩阵检索RAG在低成本事实查询中表现良好，GraphRAG Global在主题性查询中提供更丰富的教育内容，GraphRAG Local在资源整合性关键时准确率最高。

Conclusion: 资源消耗高的GraphRAG（资源使用量高10-20倍）适合主题性查询，建议采用动态分支框架根据查询类型选择最优检索方法，以提高教育环境中RAG增强语言模型的效果和效率。

Abstract: Large language models like ChatGPT are increasingly used in classrooms, but
they often provide outdated or fabricated information that can mislead
students. Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) improves reliability of LLMs by
grounding responses in external resources. We investigate two accessible RAG
paradigms, vector-based retrieval and graph-based retrieval to identify best
practices for classroom question answering (QA). Existing comparative studies
fail to account for pedagogical factors such as educational disciplines,
question types, and practical deployment costs. Using a novel dataset,
EduScopeQA, of 3,176 questions across academic subjects, we measure performance
on various educational query types, from specific facts to broad thematic
discussions. We also evaluate system alignment with a dataset of systematically
altered textbooks that contradict the LLM's latent knowledge. We find that
OpenAI Vector Search RAG (representing vector-based RAG) performs well as a
low-cost generalist, especially for quick fact retrieval. On the other hand,
GraphRAG Global excels at providing pedagogically rich answers to thematic
queries, and GraphRAG Local achieves the highest accuracy with the dense,
altered textbooks when corpus integrity is critical. Accounting for the 10-20x
higher resource usage of GraphRAG (representing graph-based RAG), we show that
a dynamic branching framework that routes queries to the optimal retrieval
method boosts fidelity and efficiency. These insights provide actionable
guidelines for educators and system designers to integrate RAG-augmented LLMs
into learning environments effectively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有代码LLM依赖于从专有LLM精粲的大规模指令数据进行微调，成本较高。需要尝试利用小规模开源LLM来生成高质量代码指令数据。

Method: 提出迭代自我精粲方法：1)多检查点采样和多方面评分策略进行初始数据选择；2)基于梯度的影响估计方法进行最终数据过滤；3)基于生成的数据训练SCoder代码生成模型。

Result: SCoder模型容家族在代码生成能力方面达到了最先进水平，证明了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 小规模开源LLM通过适当训练可以转化为强大的数据生成器，减少对专有LLM的依赖，以更低成本生成高质量代码指令数据。

Abstract: Existing code large language models (LLMs) often rely on large-scale
instruction data distilled from proprietary LLMs for fine-tuning, which
typically incurs high costs. In this paper, we explore the potential of
small-scale open-source LLMs (e.g., 7B) as synthesizers for high-quality code
instruction data construction. We first observe that the data synthesis
capability of small-scale LLMs can be enhanced by training on a few superior
data synthesis samples from proprietary LLMs. Building on this, we propose a
novel iterative self-distillation approach to bootstrap small-scale LLMs,
transforming them into powerful synthesizers that reduce reliance on
proprietary LLMs and minimize costs. Concretely, in each iteration, to obtain
diverse and high-quality self-distilled data, we design multi-checkpoint
sampling and multi-aspect scoring strategies for initial data selection.
Furthermore, to identify the most influential samples, we introduce a
gradient-based influence estimation method for final data filtering. Based on
the code instruction datasets from the small-scale synthesizers, we develop
SCoder, a family of code generation models fine-tuned from DeepSeek-Coder.
SCoder models achieve state-of-the-art code generation capabilities,
demonstrating the effectiveness of our method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 约束编程建模语言复杂、全局约束众多、建模技巧要求高，阻碍了非专家用户使用CP解决组合问题，需要一种方法让非专家也能获得专家级模型

Method: 构建专家编写的模型数据库，基于用户自然语言问题描述检索最相似的源代码模型，使用专家验证的模型库确保质量，无需人工数据标注

Result: 实验显示系统在不同专业水平的用户问题描述下都能以优秀准确率检索到正确模型

Conclusion: CP-Model-Zoo通过利用积累的专家模型库，有效解决了非专家用户使用约束编程的障碍，实现了从自然语言到专家级模型的自动转换

Abstract: Constraint Programming and its high-level modeling languages have long been
recognized for their potential to achieve the holy grail of problem-solving.
However, the complexity of modeling languages, the large number of global
constraints, and the art of creating good models have often hindered
non-experts from choosing CP to solve their combinatorial problems. While
generating an expert-level model from a natural-language description of a
problem would be the dream, we are not yet there. We propose a tutoring system
called CP-Model-Zoo, exploiting expert-written models accumulated through the
years. CP-Model-Zoo retrieves the closest source code model from a database
based on a user's natural language description of a combinatorial problem. It
ensures that expert-validated models are presented to the user while
eliminating the need for human data labeling. Our experiments show excellent
accuracy in retrieving the correct model based on a user-input description of a
problem simulated with different levels of expertise.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有物理基准测试存在两个主要缺陷：缺乏对物理奥林匹克竞赛等真实世界物理竞赛的系统性覆盖，以及无法实现与人类表现的直接比较。

Method: 收集13个2024-2025年国际和地区奥赛试题，采用官方评分标准进行细粒度评分，基于奖牌阈值对模型进行奖牌等级评定。

Result: 开源MLLM大多处于或低于铜牌水平；开源LLM有进步但偶尔获金牌；闭源推理MLLM可获得6-12枚金牌；所有模型与满分仍有显著差距。

Conclusion: 开源模型与顶尖学生存在显著性能差距，闭源推理模型展现强大物理推理能力，仍有很大改进空间。HiPhO作为严谨的人类对齐基准测试开源可用。

Abstract: Recently, the physical capabilities of (M)LLMs have garnered increasing
attention. However, existing benchmarks for physics suffer from two major gaps:
they neither provide systematic and up-to-date coverage of real-world physics
competitions such as physics Olympiads, nor enable direct performance
comparison with humans. To bridge these gaps, we present HiPhO, the first
benchmark dedicated to high school physics Olympiads with human-aligned
evaluation. Specifically, HiPhO highlights three key innovations. (1)
Comprehensive Data: It compiles 13 latest Olympiad exams from 2024-2025,
spanning both international and regional competitions, and covering mixed
modalities that encompass problems spanning text-only to diagram-based. (2)
Professional Evaluation: We adopt official marking schemes to perform
fine-grained grading at both the answer and step level, fully aligned with
human examiners to ensure high-quality and domain-specific evaluation. (3)
Comparison with Human Contestants: We assign gold, silver, and bronze medals to
models based on official medal thresholds, thereby enabling direct comparison
between (M)LLMs and human contestants. Our large-scale evaluation of 30
state-of-the-art (M)LLMs shows that: across 13 exams, open-source MLLMs mostly
remain at or below the bronze level; open-source LLMs show promising progress
with occasional golds; closed-source reasoning MLLMs can achieve 6 to 12 gold
medals; and most models still have a significant gap from full marks. These
results highlight a substantial performance gap between open-source models and
top students, the strong physical reasoning capabilities of closed-source
reasoning models, and the fact that there is still significant room for
improvement. HiPhO, as a rigorous, human-aligned, and Olympiad-focused
benchmark for advancing multimodal physical reasoning, is open-source and
available at https://github.com/SciYu/HiPhO.

TL;DR: 这篇论文开发了测量语言模型神福感的实验方法，通过比较言词报告咊行为表现来验证偏好满足度作为神福感代理指标的可行性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究者强调了语言模型神福感测量的重要性，希望通过实验方法来评估AI系统的神福状态，以及偏好满足是否可以作为有效的神福感代理指标。

Method: 研究使用了多种实验范式：比较模型的言词偏好报告与虚拟环境中的行为表现；测试成本和奖励对行为的影响；验证神福感量表在语义等价提示下的一致性。

Result: 观察到了说明的偏好与行为之间的可靠相关性，支持偏好满足可以作为神福感代理指标。但一致性在不同模型和条件下有差异，并且对干扰的响应不一致。

Conclusion: 虽然不确定方法是否真正测量了语言模型的神福感状态，但研究结果显示了语言模型神福感测量的可行性，并为后续研究提供了有价值的实验框架和观察结果。

Abstract: We develop new experimental paradigms for measuring welfare in language
models. We compare verbal reports of models about their preferences with
preferences expressed through behavior when navigating a virtual environment
and selecting conversation topics. We also test how costs and rewards affect
behavior and whether responses to an eudaimonic welfare scale - measuring
states such as autonomy and purpose in life - are consistent across
semantically equivalent prompts. Overall, we observed a notable degree of
mutual support between our measures. The reliable correlations observed between
stated preferences and behavior across conditions suggest that preference
satisfaction can, in principle, serve as an empirically measurable welfare
proxy in some of today's AI systems. Furthermore, our design offered an
illuminating setting for qualitative observation of model behavior. Yet, the
consistency between measures was more pronounced in some models and conditions
than others and responses were not consistent across perturbations. Due to
this, and the background uncertainty about the nature of welfare and the
cognitive states (and welfare subjecthood) of language models, we are currently
uncertain whether our methods successfully measure the welfare state of
language models. Nevertheless, these findings highlight the feasibility of
welfare measurement in language models, inviting further exploration.

TL;DR: VISION是一个基于反亏实例训练的围网神经网络框架，通过大语言模型生成反亏样本，减少漏洞检测中的偏偏相关，提高检测的稳健性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 围网神经网络在漏洞检测中遇到训练数据不平衡和标签噪声问题，容易学习到表面代码相似性的偏偏相关，导致检测器在真实数据上的演绎性差。

Method: 使用大语言模型生成反亏样本，对包含相反标签的成对代码示例进行目标训练，并通过图基于可解释性把握关键代码语句。

Result: 在CWE-20漏洞上，总体准确率从51.8%提升到97.8%，成对对比准确率从4.5%提升到95.8%，最差组准确率从0.7%提升到85.5%。

Conclusion: VISION框架能够有效减少偏偏学习，提高漏洞检测的稳健性和可演绎性，为构建透明可信的AI安全系统提供支撑。

Abstract: Automated detection of vulnerabilities in source code is an essential
cybersecurity challenge, underpinning trust in digital systems and services.
Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a promising approach as they can
learn structural and logical code relationships in a data-driven manner.
However, their performance is severely constrained by training data imbalances
and label noise. GNNs often learn 'spurious' correlations from superficial code
similarities, producing detectors that fail to generalize well to unseen
real-world data. In this work, we propose a unified framework for robust and
interpretable vulnerability detection, called VISION, to mitigate spurious
correlations by systematically augmenting a counterfactual training dataset.
Counterfactuals are samples with minimal semantic modifications but opposite
labels. Our framework includes: (i) generating counterfactuals by prompting a
Large Language Model (LLM); (ii) targeted GNN training on paired code examples
with opposite labels; and (iii) graph-based interpretability to identify the
crucial code statements relevant for vulnerability predictions while ignoring
spurious ones. We find that VISION reduces spurious learning and enables more
robust, generalizable detection, improving overall accuracy (from 51.8% to
97.8%), pairwise contrast accuracy (from 4.5% to 95.8%), and worst-group
accuracy (from 0.7% to 85.5%) on the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE)-20
vulnerability. We further demonstrate gains using proposed metrics: intra-class
attribution variance, inter-class attribution distance, and node score
dependency. We also release CWE-20-CFA, a benchmark of 27,556 functions (real
and counterfactual) from the high-impact CWE-20 category. Finally, VISION
advances transparent and trustworthy AI-based cybersecurity systems through
interactive visualization for human-in-the-loop analysis.

Motivation: 解决驿鹿优化算法(GOA)在探索与开发之间的不平衡问题，以及群体内部信息交换不充分的缺点。

Method: 提出多策略改进驿鹿优化算法(MSIGOA)，包括：1)基于迭代的更新框架，根据优化过程切换开发与探索；2)两种自适应参数调整策略；3)基于优势群体的重启策略。

Result: 在CEC2017和CEC2022测试集上，MSIGOA不比GOA差的函数比例分别为92.2%和83.3%，不比其他先进算法差的比例分别为88.57%和87.5%，并通过工程设计优化问题验证了扩展性。

Conclusion: MSIGOA通过多种改进策略显著提升了算法的优化性能，具有更好的收敛性能和效率，能够有效处理复杂优化问题。

Abstract: Aiming at the shortcomings of the gazelle optimization algorithm, such as the
imbalance between exploration and exploitation and the insufficient information
exchange within the population, this paper proposes a multi-strategy improved
gazelle optimization algorithm (MSIGOA). To address these issues, MSIGOA
proposes an iteration-based updating framework that switches between
exploitation and exploration according to the optimization process, which
effectively enhances the balance between local exploitation and global
exploration in the optimization process and improves the convergence speed. Two
adaptive parameter tuning strategies improve the applicability of the algorithm
and promote a smoother optimization process. The dominant population-based
restart strategy enhances the algorithms ability to escape from local optima
and avoid its premature convergence. These enhancements significantly improve
the exploration and exploitation capabilities of MSIGOA, bringing superior
convergence and efficiency in dealing with complex problems. In this paper, the
parameter sensitivity, strategy effectiveness, convergence and stability of the
proposed method are evaluated on two benchmark test sets including CEC2017 and
CEC2022. Test results and statistical tests show that MSIGOA outperforms basic
GOA and other advanced algorithms. On the CEC2017 and CEC2022 test sets, the
proportion of functions where MSIGOA is not worse than GOA is 92.2% and 83.3%,
respectively, and the proportion of functions where MSIGOA is not worse than
other algorithms is 88.57% and 87.5%, respectively. Finally, the extensibility
of MSIGAO is further verified by several engineering design optimization
problems.

TL;DR: 本文挖成传统梯度基神经网络训练中前向传播与反向传播的对称性要求，证明只需保持梯度方向而非精确大小即可有效训练，从而支持使用平坦或非可微激活函数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统梯度基训练要求激活函数必须可微或次可微，这严重限制了激活函数的选择，特别是排除了具有平坦或非可微区域的函数。本文挖成这种前向-反向传播对称性的假设。

Method: 通过数学分析证明梯度大小的精确性并非必需，只需保持梯度方向。在MLP、CNN和BNN等基础架构上进行实验，使用简单或随机梯度替代传统梯度。

Result: 实验结果显示，放宽对称性要求并不影响学习效果，反而可能提升训练稳定性和效率。甚至可以有效训练使用Heaviside步进函数等平坦/非可微激活函数的网络。

Conclusion: 本文为神经网络激活函数的设计提供了更大灵活性，允许使用更简单、更高效的激活函数，同时保持甚至提升训练性能。

Abstract: Gradient-based neural network training traditionally enforces symmetry
between forward and backward propagation, requiring activation functions to be
differentiable (or sub-differentiable) and strictly monotonic in certain
regions to prevent flat gradient areas. This symmetry, linking forward
activations closely to backward gradients, significantly restricts the
selection of activation functions, particularly excluding those with
substantial flat or non-differentiable regions. In this paper, we challenge
this assumption through mathematical analysis, demonstrating that precise
gradient magnitudes derived from activation functions are largely redundant,
provided the gradient direction is preserved. Empirical experiments conducted
on foundational architectures - such as Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs),
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), and Binary Neural Networks (BNNs) -
confirm that relaxing forward-backward symmetry and substituting traditional
gradients with simpler or stochastic alternatives does not impair learning and
may even enhance training stability and efficiency. We explicitly demonstrate
that neural networks with flat or non-differentiable activation functions, such
as the Heaviside step function, can be effectively trained, thereby expanding
design flexibility and computational efficiency. Further empirical validation
with more complex architectures remains a valuable direction for future
research.

(100% of original embedding performance) even under intentionally introduced
noise, indicating a resilient mechanism for semantic encoding in neuromorphic
systems. Next steps include integrating the mapping with spiking transformers
and liquid state machines (resembling Hopfield Networks) for further

Motivation: 传统面向对象编程将安全逻辑与业务功能交织，导致代码纠缠、分散和可维护性降低，需要更好的方法来处理横切安全关注点

Method: 采用案例研究方法，比较基于AOP的安全功能实现（认证、授权、输入验证等）与传统OOP或中间件方法，分析代码质量指标、性能指标和可维护性指标

Result: AOP增强了安全机制的模块化、可重用性和可维护性，同时只引入最小的性能开销

Conclusion: AOP为软件工程师和研究人员在Web应用开发中平衡安全性与软件质量提供了实用见解

Abstract: Security remains a critical challenge in modern web applications, where
threats such as unauthorized access, data breaches, and injection attacks
continue to undermine trust and reliability. Traditional Object-Oriented
Programming (OOP) often intertwines security logic with business functionality,
leading to code tangling, scattering, and reduced maintainability. This study
investigates the role of Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) in enhancing secure
software development by modularizing cross-cutting security concerns. Using a
case study approach, we compare AOP-based implementations of security features
including authentication, authorization, input validation, encryption, logging,
and session management with conventional OOP or middleware-based approaches.
Data collection involves analyzing code quality metrics (e.g., lines of code,
coupling, cohesion, modularity index, reusability), performance metrics
(response time, throughput, memory usage), and maintainability indicators.
Developer feedback is also incorporated to assess integration and debugging
experiences. Statistical methods, guided by the ISO/IEC 25010 software quality
model, are applied to evaluate differences across implementations. The findings
demonstrate that AOP enhances modularity, reusability, and maintainability of
security mechanisms, while introducing only minimal performance overhead. The
study contributes practical insights for software engineers and researchers
seeking to balance security with software quality in web application
development.

Conclusion: CRACI架构成功解决了传统工业架构的局限性，为工业4.0提供了云原生、可扩展的解决方案，通过理论分析和实际数据验证了其有效性。

Abstract: The convergence of Information Technology (IT) and Operational Technology
(OT) in Industry 4.0 exposes the limitations of traditional, hierarchical
architectures like ISA-95 and RAMI 4.0. Their inherent rigidity, data silos,
and lack of support for cloud-native technologies impair the development of
scalable and interoperable industrial systems. This paper addresses this issue
by introducing CRACI, a Cloud-native Reference Architecture for the Industrial
Compute Continuum. Among other features, CRACI promotes a decoupled and
event-driven model to enable flexible, non-hierarchical data flows across the
continuum. It embeds cross-cutting concerns as foundational pillars: Trust,
Governance & Policy, Observability, and Lifecycle Management, ensuring quality
attributes are core to the design. The proposed architecture is validated
through a two-fold approach: (1) a comparative theoretical analysis against
established standards, operational models, and academic proposals; and (2) a
quantitative evaluation based on performance data from previously published
real-world smart manufacturing implementations. The results demonstrate that
CRACI provides a viable, state-of-the-art architecture that utilizes the
compute continuum to overcome the structural limitations of legacy models and
enable scalable, modern industrial systems.

*Huu Hung Nguyen,Anh Tuan Nguyen,Thanh Le-Cong,Yikun Li,Han Wei Ang,Yide Yin,Frank Liauw,Shar Lwin Khin,Ouh Eng Lieh,Ting Zhang,David Lo*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: PatchSeeker是一个利用大语言模型自动连接NVD漏洞描述与修复提交的新方法，通过生成语义嵌入和增强提交消息来提升映射准确性，相比现有最佳方法MRR提升59.3%，Recall@10提升27.9%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 国家漏洞数据库(NVD)缺乏漏洞与修复提交(VFCs)的明确链接，现有方法依赖稀疏且嘈杂的提交消息，无法捕捉漏洞描述的深层语义，需要更有效的自动化映射方法。

Method: 利用大语言模型生成NVD描述的嵌入向量，并为简短或无信息的提交消息合成详细摘要，构建漏洞描述与代码变更之间的语义桥梁。

Result: 在基准数据集上比最佳基线方法Prospector的MRR高59.3%，Recall@10高27.9%，在近期CVE上的扩展评估进一步验证了有效性。

Conclusion: PatchSeeker通过LLM增强的语义映射有效解决了漏洞与修复提交的链接问题，消融研究表明提交消息生成方法和骨干LLM选择都对性能有积极贡献。

Abstract: Software vulnerabilities pose serious risks to modern software ecosystems.
While the National Vulnerability Database (NVD) is the authoritative source for
cataloging these vulnerabilities, it often lacks explicit links to the
corresponding Vulnerability-Fixing Commits (VFCs). VFCs encode precise code
changes, enabling vulnerability localization, patch analysis, and dataset
construction. Automatically mapping NVD records to their true VFCs is therefore
critical. Existing approaches have limitations as they rely on sparse, often
noisy commit messages and fail to capture the deep semantics in the
vulnerability descriptions. To address this gap, we introduce PatchSeeker, a
novel method that leverages large language models to create rich semantic links
between vulnerability descriptions and their VFCs. PatchSeeker generates
embeddings from NVD descriptions and enhances commit messages by synthesizing
detailed summaries for those that are short or uninformative. These generated
messages act as a semantic bridge, effectively closing the information gap
between natural language reports and low-level code changes. Our approach
PatchSeeker achieves 59.3% higher MRR and 27.9% higher Recall@10 than the
best-performing baseline, Prospector, on the benchmark dataset. The extended
evaluation on recent CVEs further confirms PatchSeeker's effectiveness.
Ablation study shows that both the commit message generation method and the
selection of backbone LLMs make a positive contribution to PatchSeeker. We also
discuss limitations and open challenges to guide future work.

### [220] [Bridging the Gap Between Binary and Source Based Package Management in Spack](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07728)
*John Gouwar,Gregory Becker,Tamara Dahlgren,Nathan Hanford,Arjun Guha,Todd Gamblin*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Spack包管理器通过splicing技术实现了二进制包和源码包的混合使用，解决了HPC环境中二进制包兼容性限制和源码编译速度慢的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 二进制包管理器安装快速但配置灵活性差，源码包管理器灵活但编译缓慢。HPC环境中安装新MPI实现等ABI敏感依赖时需要大量重编译，现有Spack缺乏二进制兼容性模型。

Method: 提出splicing技术，扩展Spack的包语言和依赖解析引擎，建立包间二进制兼容性模型，允许无缝混合使用源码和二进制分发。

Result: 在保持源码构建灵活性的同时重用兼容二进制包，安装时间开销最小，即使对于MPI等ABI敏感依赖也能快速从二进制安装，避免大量重编译。

Conclusion: splicing技术成功解决了HPC包管理中二进制兼容性和构建效率的平衡问题，为Spack提供了混合源码和二进制分发的能力。

Abstract: Binary package managers install software quickly but they limit
configurability due to rigid ABI requirements that ensure compatibility between
binaries. Source package managers provide flexibility in building software, but
compilation can be slow. For example, installing an HPC code with a new MPI
implementation may result in a full rebuild. Spack, a widely deployed,
HPC-focused package manager, can use source and pre-compiled binaries, but
lacks a binary compatibility model, so it cannot mix binaries not built
together. We present splicing, an extension to Spack that models binary
compatibility between packages and allows seamless mixing of source and binary
distributions. Splicing augments Spack's packaging language and dependency
resolution engine to reuse compatible binaries but maintains the flexibility of
source builds. It incurs minimal installation-time overhead and allows rapid
installation from binaries, even for ABI-sensitive dependencies like MPI that
would otherwise require many rebuilds.

*Maksym Avramenko,David Chapela-Campa,Marlon Dumas,Fredrik Milani*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于事件日志初始化模拟状态的短期业务流程模拟方法，相比传统的空状态长期模拟，能更准确地预测短期性能表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统业务流程模拟方法主要支持战术决策，从空状态开始模拟长期效果，无法有效支持需要基于当前进行中案例状态进行短期预测的操作决策。

Method: 开发了一种模拟引擎，从事件日志中提取当前案例和资源状态信息，初始化模拟运行，在给定时间范围内模拟案例执行。

Result: 实验评估表明，该方法比带预热期的长期模拟产生更准确的短期性能预测，特别是在存在概念漂移或突发性能模式的情况下。

Conclusion: 基于事件日志状态初始化的短期模拟方法为操作决策提供了更有效的支持，特别是在处理临时中断和资源短缺等场景时具有优势。

Abstract: Business process simulation is an approach to evaluate business process
changes prior to implementation. Existing methods in this field primarily
support tactical decision-making, where simulations start from an empty state
and aim to estimate the long-term effects of process changes. A complementary
use-case is operational decision-making, where the goal is to forecast
short-term performance based on ongoing cases and to analyze the impact of
temporary disruptions, such as demand spikes and shortfalls in available
resources. An approach to tackle this use-case is to run a long-term simulation
up to a point where the workload is similar to the current one (warm-up), and
measure performance thereon. However, this approach does not consider the
current state of ongoing cases and resources in the process. This paper studies
an alternative approach that initializes the simulation from a representation
of the current state derived from an event log of ongoing cases. The paper
addresses two challenges in operationalizing this approach: (1) Given a
simulation model, what information is needed so that a simulation run can start
from the current state of cases and resources? (2) How can the current state of
a process be derived from an event log? The resulting short-term simulation
approach is embodied in a simulation engine that takes as input a simulation
model and a log of ongoing cases, and simulates cases for a given time horizon.
An experimental evaluation shows that this approach yields more accurate
short-term performance forecasts than long-term simulations with warm-up
period, particularly in the presence of concept drift or bursty performance
patterns.

*Mikel Robredo,Matteo Esposito,Fabio Palomba,Rafael Peñaloza,Valentina Lenarduzzi*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: LLMs能有效识别80%的代码重构动机，但与传统文献动机匹配度仅47%，主要关注可读性、清晰度和结构改进，在架构推理方面存在局限


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解开发者重构代码的原因以及哪些指标能捕捉这些动机，以支持更广泛和有效的重构实践

Method: 大规模实证研究，利用大语言模型从版本控制数据中识别重构动机，并与文献中报告的动机进行比较

Result: LLMs在80%的情况下与人类判断一致，但与文献动机仅47%匹配；丰富了22%的动机细节；大多数动机是实用性的，关注简化和可维护性；开发者经验和代码可读性指标排名最高但与动机类别相关性弱

Conclusion: LLMs能有效捕捉表面层动机但在架构推理方面存在困难，其价值在于提供局部化解释，与软件指标结合可形成混合方法，为系统化优先重构和平衡短期改进与长期架构目标提供有前景的路径

Abstract: Context. Code refactoring improves software quality without changing external
behavior. Despite its advantages, its benefits are hindered by the considerable
cost of time, resources, and continuous effort it demands. Aim. Understanding
why developers refactor, and which metrics capture these motivations, may
support wider and more effective use of refactoring in practice. Method. We
performed a large-scale empirical study to analyze developers refactoring
activity, leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to identify underlying
motivations from version control data, comparing our findings with previous
motivations reported in the literature. Results. LLMs matched human judgment in
80% of cases, but aligned with literature-based motivations in only 47%. They
enriched 22% of motivations with more detailed rationale, often highlighting
readability, clarity, and structural improvements. Most motivations were
pragmatic, focused on simplification and maintainability. While metrics related
to developer experience and code readability ranked highest, their correlation
with motivation categories was weak. Conclusions. We conclude that LLMs
effectively capture surface-level motivations but struggle with architectural
reasoning. Their value lies in providing localized explanations, which, when
combined with software metrics, can form hybrid approaches. Such integration
offers a promising path toward prioritizing refactoring more systematically and
balancing short-term improvements with long-term architectural goals.

### [223] ["We provide our resources in a dedicated repository": Surveying the Transparency of HICSS publications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07851)
*Irdin Pekaric,Giovanni Apruzzese*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 研究分析了HICSS会议论文中外部仓库的使用情况，发现只有3%论文包含可用的公开仓库


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究质量的透明性和可复现性对科学进步至关重要，外部仓库能够存储研究数据和工具，但实际使用情况不明

Method: 收集2017-2024年HICSS会议的5579篇论文，识别包含人类研究(850篇)或技术实现(737篇)的论文，检查其中包含外部仓库链接的比例并审查内容

Result: 在2028篇相关论文中，仅有3%的论文包含功能正常、公开可用且能够被下游研究使用的外部仓库

Conclusion: 虽然外部仓库对于研究透明性和可复现性很重要，但在HICSS论文中的实际使用率极低，需要推动更好的研究实践

Abstract: Every day, new discoveries are made by researchers from all across the globe
and fields. HICSS is a flagship venue to present and discuss such scientific
advances. Yet, the activities carried out for any given research can hardly be
fully contained in a single document of a few pages-the "paper." Indeed, any
given study entails data, artifacts, or other material that is crucial to truly
appreciate the contributions claimed in the corresponding paper. External
repositories (e.g., GitHub) are a convenient tool to store all such resources
so that future work can freely observe and build upon them -- thereby improving
transparency and promoting reproducibility of research as a whole. In this
work, we scrutinize the extent to which papers recently accepted to HICSS
leverage such repositories to provide supplementary material. To this end, we
collect all the 5579 papers included in HICSS proceedings from 2017-2024. Then,
we identify those entailing either human subject research (850) or technical
implementations (737), or both (147). Finally, we review their text, examining
how many include a link to an external repository-and, inspect its contents.
Overall, out of 2028 papers, only 3\% have a functional and publicly available
repository that is usable by downstream research. We release all our tools.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 这篇论文研究了使用大语言模型自动化Android洗入测试的效果，通过对比传统手动方法和AI生成的洗入脚本，评估了自动化测试在获取Android设备高权限访问方面的效能、可靠性和可扩展性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人工智能和大语言模型的快速发展为网络安全领域带来了新机遇，特别是在洗入测试自动化方面。这项研究旨在探索LLM基础工具在Android洗入测试中的应用价值。

Method: 使用Android模拟器(Genymotion)作为测试平台，完整执行传统手动洗入方法和AI生成的洗入脚本。集成OpenAI API开发了一个网站应用程序，用于自动生成LLM处理响应的脚本。通过对比自动化和手动洗入测试协议来评估AI洗入的效果。

Result: 研究发现，虽然LLM能够显著简化洗入工作流程，但需要人类监控以确保准确性和遵循道德规范。识别了LLM在洗入测试中的优势咄劣势。

Conclusion: 这项研究为AI驱动的网络安全领域增添了重要文献，揭示了大语言模型在道德黑客技术、安全研究和移动设备安全方面的影响，并提供了有关AI洗入技术的安全建议和道德考虑。

Abstract: The rapid evolution of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Large Language Models
(LLMs) has opened up new opportunities in the area of cybersecurity, especially
in the exploitation automation landscape and penetration testing. This study
explores Android penetration testing automation using LLM-based tools,
especially PentestGPT, to identify and execute rooting techniques. Through a
comparison of the traditional manual rooting process and exploitation methods
produced using AI, this study evaluates the efficacy, reliability, and
scalability of automated penetration testing in achieving high-level privilege
access on Android devices. With the use of an Android emulator (Genymotion) as
the testbed, we fully execute both traditional and exploit-based rooting
methods, automating the process using AI-generated scripts. Secondly, we create
a web application by integrating OpenAI's API to facilitate automated script
generation from LLM-processed responses. The research focuses on the
effectiveness of AI-enabled exploitation by comparing automated and manual
penetration testing protocols, by determining LLM weaknesses and strengths
along the way. We also provide security suggestions of AI-enabled exploitation,
including ethical factors and potential misuse. The findings exhibit that while
LLMs can significantly streamline the workflow of exploitation, they need to be
controlled by humans to ensure accuracy and ethical application. This study
adds to the increasing body of literature on AI-powered cybersecurity and its
effect on ethical hacking, security research, and mobile device security.

### [225] [Avoiding Over-Personalization with Rule-Guided Knowledge Graph Adaptation for LLM Recommendations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07133)
*Fernando Spadea,Oshani Seneviratne*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 轻量级神经符号框架，通过在推理时适应性修改用户知识图来减少LLM推荐系统的过度个性化问题，在保持推荐质量的同时提高内容新颖性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM基于推荐系统中的过度个性化问题，这会导致个性化信息环境(PIEs)和过滤氛，限制内容多样性。

Method: 使用符号适应策略（软重新权重、硬反转、偏见三元组删除）来重构用户个性化知识图(PKG)，通过结构化提示引导语言模型产生更多样的推荐。

Result: 在菜谱推荐平台上识别出个性化PKG适应能显著提高内容新颖性，同时保持推荐质量，效果超过全局适应和简单提示方法。

Conclusion: 通过符号方法适应性修改用户知识图是一种有效的方法，可以减少LLM推荐系统的过度个性化，促进内容多样性而不丢失相关性。

Abstract: We present a lightweight neuro-symbolic framework to mitigate
over-personalization in LLM-based recommender systems by adapting user-side
Knowledge Graphs (KGs) at inference time. Instead of retraining models or
relying on opaque heuristics, our method restructures a user's Personalized
Knowledge Graph (PKG) to suppress feature co-occurrence patterns that reinforce
Personalized Information Environments (PIEs), i.e., algorithmically induced
filter bubbles that constrain content diversity. These adapted PKGs are used to
construct structured prompts that steer the language model toward more diverse,
Out-PIE recommendations while preserving topical relevance. We introduce a
family of symbolic adaptation strategies, including soft reweighting, hard
inversion, and targeted removal of biased triples, and a client-side learning
algorithm that optimizes their application per user. Experiments on a recipe
recommendation benchmark show that personalized PKG adaptations significantly
increase content novelty while maintaining recommendation quality,
outperforming global adaptation and naive prompt-based methods.

### [226] [Beyond Sequential Reranking: Reranker-Guided Search Improves Reasoning Intensive Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07163)
*Haike Xu,Tong Chen*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: Reranker-Guided-Search (RGS) 是一种新的检索方法，通过直接根据重排序器偏好检索文档，而不是传统的顺序重排序方法，在有限的100文档重排序预算下，在多个基准测试中实现了显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的检索-重排序流水线存在两个关键限制：受限于初始检索的top-k文档质量，以及基于LLM的重排序器计算需求增长限制了可处理文档数量。

Method: 使用近似最近邻算法生成的邻近图进行贪婪搜索，基于文档相似性战略性地优先选择有前景的文档进行重排序。

Result: 在多个基准测试中取得显著性能提升：BRIGHT提升3.5分，FollowIR提升2.9分，M-BEIR提升5.1分，所有结果都在100文档的重排序预算约束下实现。

Conclusion: 在固定的嵌入和重排序器模型对下，战略性地选择要重排序的文档可以在有限的重排序预算下显著提高检索准确性。

Abstract: The widely used retrieve-and-rerank pipeline faces two critical limitations:
they are constrained by the initial retrieval quality of the top-k documents,
and the growing computational demands of LLM-based rerankers restrict the
number of documents that can be effectively processed. We introduce
Reranker-Guided-Search (RGS), a novel approach that bypasses these limitations
by directly retrieving documents according to reranker preferences rather than
following the traditional sequential reranking method. Our method uses a greedy
search on proximity graphs generated by approximate nearest neighbor
algorithms, strategically prioritizing promising documents for reranking based
on document similarity. Experimental results demonstrate substantial
performance improvements across multiple benchmarks: 3.5 points on BRIGHT, 2.9
on FollowIR, and 5.1 on M-BEIR, all within a constrained reranker budget of 100
documents. Our analysis suggests that, given a fixed pair of embedding and
reranker models, strategically selecting documents to rerank can significantly
improve retrieval accuracy under limited reranker budget.

*Julian Killingback,Hamed Zamani*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 这篇论文构建了一个多样化的复杂检索任务测试集，用于评估检索模型在复杂查询下的性能，发现即使最好的模型也面临明显挑战，LLM查询扩展技术对强模型效果不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前检索模型在复杂查询任务上缺乏评估资源，现有评测集范围有限且不具实际性，无法真正评估检索模型在复杂实际任务中的能力。

Method: 构建了一个多样化且实际的复杂检索任务集，对代表性的状态前沿检索模型进行基准测试，并探索LLM基于查询扩展咍重写对检索质量的影响。

Result: 即使最佳模型也面临明显挑战：nDCG@10平均仅0.346，R@100仅0.587。LLM增强技术对弱模型有帮助，但对强模型在所有指标上都造成性能下降。

Conclusion: 复杂检索任务对现有检索模型构成重大挑战，需要新的方法来提升性能。LLM查询扩展并非万能解决方案，特别是对已经强大的模型可能会产生负面影响。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are incredible and versatile tools for
text-based tasks that have enabled countless, previously unimaginable,
applications. Retrieval models, in contrast, have not yet seen such capable
general-purpose models emerge. To achieve this goal, retrieval models must be
able to perform complex retrieval tasks, where queries contain multiple parts,
constraints, or requirements in natural language. These tasks represent a
natural progression from the simple, single-aspect queries that are used in the
vast majority of existing, commonly used evaluation sets. Complex queries
naturally arise as people expect search systems to handle more specific and
often ambitious information requests, as is demonstrated by how people use
LLM-based information systems. Despite the growing desire for retrieval models
to expand their capabilities in complex retrieval tasks, there exist limited
resources to assess the ability of retrieval models on a comprehensive set of
diverse complex tasks. The few resources that do exist feature a limited scope
and often lack realistic settings making it hard to know the true capabilities
of retrieval models on complex real-world retrieval tasks. To address this
shortcoming and spur innovation in next-generation retrieval models, we
construct a diverse and realistic set of complex retrieval tasks and benchmark
a representative set of state-of-the-art retrieval models. Additionally, we
explore the impact of LLM-based query expansion and rewriting on retrieval
quality. Our results show that even the best models struggle to produce
high-quality retrieval results with the highest average nDCG@10 of only 0.346
and R@100 of only 0.587 across all tasks. Although LLM augmentation can help
weaker models, the strongest model has decreased performance across all metrics
with all rewriting techniques.

TL;DR: 论文介绍了两个包含敏感标签分类和用户内容评分的新数据集，用于评估个性化AI系统的潜在危害


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 个性化AI系统可能向用户推荐敏感或有害内容，需要定量评估这些系统的影响，而不仅仅是关注参与度指标

Method: 创建了两个数据集：一个整合MovieLens评分数据和Does the Dog Die?网站的内容警告，另一个结合Archive of Our Own的同人小说互动数据和用户生成的警告

Result: 开发了包含敏感标签分类的数据集，使研究人员能够评估个性化系统在内容敏感性方面的表现

Conclusion: 这些数据集为定量评估个性化AI系统的潜在负面影响提供了必要工具，有助于研究如何减少敏感有害内容的推荐

Abstract: Personalized AI systems, from recommendation systems to chatbots, are a
prevalent method for distributing content to users based on their learned
preferences. However, there is growing concern about the adverse effects of
these systems, including their potential tendency to expose users to sensitive
or harmful material, negatively impacting overall well-being. To address this
concern quantitatively, it is necessary to create datasets with relevant
sensitivity labels for content, enabling researchers to evaluate personalized
systems beyond mere engagement metrics. To this end, we introduce two novel
datasets that include a taxonomy of sensitivity labels alongside user-content
ratings: one that integrates MovieLens rating data with content warnings from
the Does the Dog Die? community ratings website, and another that combines
fan-fiction interaction data and user-generated warnings from Archive of Our
Own.

TL;DR: MEGG是一个基于经验回放的增量学习框架，通过GGscore指标选择高影响力样本进行回放，有效缓解推荐系统中的灾难性遗忘问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经协同过滤模型通常在静态设置下训练，无法适应动态环境中用户偏好的演化。现有增量学习方法在推荐任务中面临数据稀疏性和任务范式差异的挑战。

Method: 提出MEGG框架，引入GGscore指标量化样本影响力，选择性回放高影响力样本。该方法是模型无关的，可无缝集成到各种架构和框架中。

Result: 在三个神经模型和四个基准数据集上的实验表明，MEGG在性能、可扩展性、效率和鲁棒性方面均优于最先进的基线方法。

Conclusion: MEGG为解决推荐系统中的增量学习问题提供了有效的解决方案，具有良好的通用性和实用性。

Abstract: Neural Collaborative Filtering models are widely used in recommender systems
but are typically trained under static settings, assuming fixed data
distributions. This limits their applicability in dynamic environments where
user preferences evolve. Incremental learning offers a promising solution, yet
conventional methods from computer vision or NLP face challenges in
recommendation tasks due to data sparsity and distinct task paradigms. Existing
approaches for neural recommenders remain limited and often lack
generalizability. To address this, we propose MEGG, Replay Samples with
Maximally Extreme GGscore, an experience replay based incremental learning
framework. MEGG introduces GGscore, a novel metric that quantifies sample
influence, enabling the selective replay of highly influential samples to
mitigate catastrophic forgetting. Being model-agnostic, MEGG integrates
seamlessly across architectures and frameworks. Experiments on three neural
models and four benchmark datasets show superior performance over
state-of-the-art baselines, with strong scalability, efficiency, and
robustness. Implementation will be released publicly upon acceptance.

*Jeongwoo Na,Jun Kwon,Eunseong Choi,Jongwuk Lee*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: MVP是一种基于大语言模型的非生成式段落重排序方法，通过多视图嵌入和正交损失来解决传统方法效率低和外部偏差敏感的问题，在保持高性能的同时大幅降低推理延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于大语言模型的段落重排序方法存在两个主要问题：(1)自回归生成和滑动窗口策略导致计算开销大，效率低下；(2)外部偏差（如位置偏差和选择偏差）影响模型准确表示段落的能力并增加输入顺序敏感性。

Method: 提出MVP模型，采用非生成式方法将查询-段落信息编码为多样化的视图嵌入，不受外部偏差影响。为每个视图生成独特的锚向量，在单次解码步骤中直接计算相关性分数，并使用正交损失使视图更具区分性。

Result: MVP仅用2.2亿参数就能达到70亿参数微调模型的性能，同时实现100倍的推理延迟降低。30亿参数版本的MVP在领域内和跨域基准测试中都达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: MVP通过创新的多视图引导方法有效解决了大语言模型在段落重排序任务中的效率和偏差问题，为高效准确的检索系统提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive
performance in passage reranking tasks. Despite their success, LLM-based
methods still face challenges in efficiency and sensitivity to external biases.
(1) Existing models rely mostly on autoregressive generation and sliding window
strategies to rank passages, which incur heavy computational overhead as the
number of passages increases. (2) External biases, such as position or
selection bias, hinder the model's ability to accurately represent passages and
increase input-order sensitivity. To address these limitations, we introduce a
novel passage reranking model, called Multi-View-guided Passage Reranking
(MVP). MVP is a non-generative LLM-based reranking method that encodes
query-passage information into diverse view embeddings without being influenced
by external biases. For each view, it combines query-aware passage embeddings
to produce a distinct anchor vector, which is then used to directly compute
relevance scores in a single decoding step. In addition, it employs an
orthogonal loss to make the views more distinctive. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that MVP, with just 220M parameters, matches the performance of
much larger 7B-scale fine-tuned models while achieving a 100x reduction in
inference latency. Notably, the 3B-parameter variant of MVP achieves
state-of-the-art performance on both in-domain and out-of-domain benchmarks.

*Zheng Dou,Deqing Wang,Fuzhen Zhuang,Jian Ren,Yanlin Hu*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: FLeW方法通过统一对比学习、细粒度表示学习和任务感知学习三种方法，利用引用意图和频率增强训练信号，实现更好的科学文档表示学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前科学文档表示学习方法存在三个问题：对比学习未充分利用引用信息且生成单向量表示；细粒度表示学习需要昂贵集成且缺乏领域泛化；任务感知学习依赖人工预定义任务分类且忽略细微任务差异。

Method: 提出FLeW方法：1）利用引用意图（背景、方法、结果）和频率进行三元组采样增强引用结构信号；2）基于科学写作通用结构进行领域泛化的方面划分；3）通过简单权重搜索自适应集成三个方面级嵌入，无需任务感知微调。

Result: 实验表明FLeW在多个科学任务和领域中展现出适用性和鲁棒性，优于现有模型。

Conclusion: FLeW成功统一了三种表示学习方法，通过引用意图驱动的方面划分和自适应集成，实现了更好的科学文档表示学习效果。

Abstract: Scientific document representation learning provides powerful embeddings for
various tasks, while current methods face challenges across three approaches.
1) Contrastive training with citation-structural signals underutilizes citation
information and still generates single-vector representations. 2) Fine-grained
representation learning, which generates multiple vectors at the sentence or
aspect level, requires costly integration and lacks domain generalization. 3)
Task-aware learning depends on manually predefined task categorization,
overlooking nuanced task distinctions and requiring extra training data for
task-specific modules. To address these problems, we propose a new method that
unifies the three approaches for better representations, namely FLeW.
Specifically, we introduce a novel triplet sampling method that leverages
citation intent and frequency to enhance citation-structural signals for
training. Citation intents (background, method, result), aligned with the
general structure of scientific writing, facilitate a domain-generalized facet
partition for fine-grained representation learning. Then, we adopt a simple
weight search to adaptively integrate three facet-level embeddings into a
task-specific document embedding without task-aware fine-tuning. Experiments
show the applicability and robustness of FLeW across multiple scientific tasks
and fields, compared to prior models.

Result: 在真实数据集上验证了ELEC在CTR预测中的有效性和效率

Conclusion: ELEC框架成功实现了LLM与传统协同CTR模型的优势结合，在保持高效率的同时提升了CTR预测性能，且具有模型无关性

Abstract: Click-through rate (CTR) prediction plays an important role in online
advertising systems. On the one hand, traditional CTR prediction models capture
the collaborative signals in tabular data via feature interaction modeling, but
they lose semantics in text. On the other hand, Large Language Models (LLMs)
excel in understanding the context and meaning behind text, but they face
challenges in capturing collaborative signals and they have long inference
latency. In this paper, we aim to leverage the benefits of both types of models
and pursue collaboration, semantics and efficiency. We present ELEC, which is
an Efficient LLM-Empowered CTR prediction framework. We first adapt an LLM for
the CTR prediction task. In order to leverage the ability of the LLM but
simultaneously keep efficiency, we utilize the pseudo-siamese network which
contains a gain network and a vanilla network. We inject the high-level
representation vector generated by the LLM into a collaborative CTR model to
form the gain network such that it can take advantage of both tabular modeling
and textual modeling. However, its reliance on the LLM limits its efficiency.
We then distill the knowledge from the gain network to the vanilla network on
both the score level and the representation level, such that the vanilla
network takes only tabular data as input, but can still generate comparable
performance as the gain network. Our approach is model-agnostic. It allows for
the integration with various existing LLMs and collaborative CTR models.
Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency
of ELEC for CTR prediction.

Abstract: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, despite their growing
popularity for enhancing model response reliability, often struggle with
trustworthiness and explainability. In this work, we present a novel, holistic,
model-agnostic, post-hoc explanation framework leveraging perturbation-based
techniques to explain the retrieval and generation processes in a RAG system.
We propose different strategies to evaluate these explanations and discuss the
sufficiency of model-agnostic explanations in RAG systems. With this work, we
further aim to catalyze a collaborative effort to build reliable and
explainable RAG systems.

Abstract: The proliferation of long-form documents presents a fundamental challenge to
information retrieval (IR), as their length, dispersed evidence, and complex
structures demand specialized methods beyond standard passage-level techniques.
This survey provides the first comprehensive treatment of long-document
retrieval (LDR), consolidating methods, challenges, and applications across
three major eras. We systematize the evolution from classical lexical and early
neural models to modern pre-trained (PLM) and large language models (LLMs),
covering key paradigms like passage aggregation, hierarchical encoding,
efficient attention, and the latest LLM-driven re-ranking and retrieval
techniques. Beyond the models, we review domain-specific applications,
specialized evaluation resources, and outline critical open challenges such as
efficiency trade-offs, multimodal alignment, and faithfulness. This survey aims
to provide both a consolidated reference and a forward-looking agenda for
advancing long-document retrieval in the era of foundation models.

Abstract: Modern information retrieval (IR) must bridge short, ambiguous queries and
ever more diverse, rapidly evolving corpora. Query Expansion (QE) remains a key
mechanism for mitigating vocabulary mismatch, but the design space has shifted
markedly with pre-trained language models (PLMs) and large language models
(LLMs). This survey synthesizes the field from three angles: (i) a
four-dimensional framework of query expansion - from the point of injection
(explicit vs. implicit QE), through grounding and interaction (knowledge bases,
model-internal capabilities, multi-turn retrieval) and learning alignment, to
knowledge graph-based argumentation; (ii) a model-centric taxonomy spanning
encoder-only, encoder-decoder, decoder-only, instruction-tuned, and
domain/multilingual variants, highlighting their characteristic affordances for
QE (contextual disambiguation, controllable generation, zero-/few-shot
reasoning); and (iii) practice-oriented guidance on where and how neural QE
helps in first-stage retrieval, multi-query fusion, re-ranking, and
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). We compare traditional query expansion
with PLM/LLM-based methods across seven key aspects, and we map applications
across web search, biomedicine, e-commerce, open-domain QA/RAG, conversational
and code search, and cross-lingual settings. The review distills design
grounding and interaction, alignment/distillation (SFT/PEFT/DPO), and KG
constraints - as robust remedies to topic drift and hallucination. We conclude
with an agenda on quality control, cost-aware invocation, domain/temporal
adaptation, evaluation beyond end-task metrics, and fairness/privacy.
Collectively, these insights provide a principled blueprint for selecting and
combining QE techniques under real-world constraints.

Abstract: Effectively managing intellectual property is a significant challenge.
Traditional methods for patent analysis depend on labor-intensive manual
searches and rigid keyword matching. These approaches are often inefficient and
struggle to reveal the complex relationships hidden within large patent
datasets, hindering strategic decision-making. To overcome these limitations,
we introduce KLIPA, a novel framework that leverages a knowledge graph and a
large language model (LLM) to significantly advance patent analysis. Our
approach integrates three key components: a structured knowledge graph to map
explicit relationships between patents, a retrieval-augmented generation(RAG)
system to uncover contextual connections, and an intelligent agent that
dynamically determines the optimal strategy for resolving user queries. We
validated KLIPA on a comprehensive, real-world patent database, where it
demonstrated substantial improvements in knowledge extraction, discovery of
novel connections, and overall operational efficiency. This combination of
technologies enhances retrieval accuracy, reduces reliance on domain experts,
and provides a scalable, automated solution for any organization managing
intellectual property, including technology corporations and legal firms,
allowing them to better navigate the complexities of strategic innovation and
competitive intelligence.
