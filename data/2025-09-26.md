### [1] [WAVECLIP: Wavelet Tokenization for Adaptive-Resolution CLIP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21153)
*Moshe Kimhi,Erez Koifman,Ehud Rivlin,Eli Schwartz,Chaim Baskin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WAVECLIP是一个基于小波变换的统一模型，通过多级小波分解替代标准补丁嵌入，实现自适应分辨率推理，支持从粗到细的图像处理，并在推理时通过键值缓存和跨层注意力重用计算，显著降低计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决CLIP模型在处理不同分辨率图像时的计算效率问题，实现自适应分辨率推理，允许用户在单个部署模型中动态选择计算精度权衡。

Method: 使用多级小波分解替代标准补丁嵌入，引入键值缓存和因果跨层注意力机制，在推理时从低分辨率开始，仅在需要时细化，通过轻量级蒸馏从冻结的CLIP教师模型学习。

Result: 在零样本分类任务中，通过简单的基于置信度的门控机制实现自适应早期退出，达到竞争性精度同时显著节省计算资源。

Conclusion: WAVECLIP通过小波基令牌化实现了高效的自适应分辨率推理，为视觉语言模型提供了灵活的计算精度权衡方案。

Abstract: We introduce WAVECLIP, a single unified model for adaptive resolution
inference in CLIP, enabled by wavelet-based tokenization. WAVECLIP replaces
standard patch embeddings with a multi-level wavelet decomposition, enabling
the model to process images coarse to fine while naturally supporting multiple
resolutions within the same model. At inference time, the model begins with low
resolution tokens and refines only when needed, using key-value caching and
causal cross-level attention to reuse computation, effectively introducing to
the model only new information when needed. We evaluate WAVECLIP in zero-shot
classification, demonstrating that a simple confidence-based gating mechanism
enables adaptive early exits. This allows users to dynamically choose a
compute-accuracy trade-off using a single deployed model. Our approach requires
only lightweight distillation from a frozen CLIP teacher and achieves
competitive accuracy with significant computational savings.

### [2] [Leveraging NTPs for Efficient Hallucination Detection in VLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20379)
*Ofir Azachi,Kfir Eliyahu,Eyal El Ani,Rom Himelstein,Roi Reichart,Yuval Pinter,Nitay Calderon*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于下一个标记概率（NTPs）的轻量级幻觉检测方法，通过训练传统机器学习模型来检测视觉语言模型（VLMs）中的幻觉问题，该方法计算效率高且性能可与强VLMs相媲美。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型（VLMs）中的幻觉问题（视觉内容与生成文本之间的不匹配）严重影响了模型的可靠性。现有的检测方法通常使用相同或不同的VLM来评估生成输出，但这种方法计算密集且增加了模型延迟。

Method: 通过训练传统机器学习模型，利用VLM的下一个标记概率（NTPs）作为特征来检测幻觉。NTPs直接量化了模型的不确定性，低NTP值（高不确定性）与幻觉强相关。还引入了语言NTPs（仅将生成文本反馈给VLM计算）来增强检测性能。

Result: 基于NTP的特征是幻觉的有价值预测因子，使快速简单的ML模型能够达到与强VLMs相当的性能。将语言NTPs与视觉NTPs结合使用，以及将VLM的幻觉预测分数集成到基于NTP的模型中，都能进一步提高检测性能。

Conclusion: 这项研究为简单、轻量级的解决方案铺平了道路，这些解决方案可以增强VLMs的可靠性。NTPs提供了一种高效的在飞行中幻觉检测方法，有望在实际应用中减少计算负担和延迟。

Abstract: Hallucinations of vision-language models (VLMs), which are misalignments
between visual content and generated text, undermine the reliability of VLMs.
One common approach for detecting them employs the same VLM, or a different
one, to assess generated outputs. This process is computationally intensive and
increases model latency. In this paper, we explore an efficient on-the-fly
method for hallucination detection by training traditional ML models over
signals based on the VLM's next-token probabilities (NTPs). NTPs provide a
direct quantification of model uncertainty. We hypothesize that high
uncertainty (i.e., a low NTP value) is strongly associated with hallucinations.
To test this, we introduce a dataset of 1,400 human-annotated statements
derived from VLM-generated content, each labeled as hallucinated or not, and
use it to test our NTP-based lightweight method. Our results demonstrate that
NTP-based features are valuable predictors of hallucinations, enabling fast and
simple ML models to achieve performance comparable to that of strong VLMs.
Furthermore, augmenting these NTPs with linguistic NTPs, computed by feeding
only the generated text back into the VLM, enhances hallucination detection
performance. Finally, integrating hallucination prediction scores from VLMs
into the NTP-based models led to better performance than using either VLMs or
NTPs alone. We hope this study paves the way for simple, lightweight solutions
that enhance the reliability of VLMs.

### [3] [Quasi-Synthetic Riemannian Data Generation for Writer-Independent Offline Signature Verification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20420)
*Elias N. Zois,Moises Diaz,Salem Said,Miguel A. Ferrer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于黎曼几何的准合成数据生成框架，用于解决离线手写签名验证在未见个体上的泛化问题，通过SPD矩阵空间生成合成数据来训练度量学习模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 离线手写签名验证在独立于书写者的设置中面临泛化挑战，现有方法依赖真实签名数据集进行训练，缺乏对未见个体的有效处理能力。

Method: 利用SPD矩阵的黎曼几何特性，通过小规模真实样本生成黎曼高斯混合模型，识别黎曼中心作为合成书写者，并通过黎曼高斯采样生成正负样本对，构建度量学习框架。

Result: 在两个包含西方和亚洲书写风格的流行签名数据集上实验表明，该方法在数据集内和跨数据集评估协议下均实现了低错误率。

Conclusion: 该方法展示了在黎曼空间中生成合成数据用于独立于书写者的签名验证系统的潜力，为解决泛化问题提供了新思路。

Abstract: Offline handwritten signature verification remains a challenging task,
particularly in writer-independent settings where models must generalize across
unseen individuals. Recent developments have highlighted the advantage of
geometrically inspired representations, such as covariance descriptors on
Riemannian manifolds. However, past or present, handcrafted or data-driven
methods usually depend on real-world signature datasets for classifier
training. We introduce a quasi-synthetic data generation framework leveraging
the Riemannian geometry of Symmetric Positive Definite matrices (SPD). A small
set of genuine samples in the SPD space is the seed to a Riemannian Gaussian
Mixture which identifies Riemannian centers as synthetic writers and variances
as their properties. Riemannian Gaussian sampling on each center generates
positive as well as negative synthetic SPD populations. A metric learning
framework utilizes pairs of similar and dissimilar SPD points, subsequently
testing it over on real-world datasets. Experiments conducted on two popular
signature datasets, encompassing Western and Asian writing styles, demonstrate
the efficacy of the proposed approach under both intra- and cross- dataset
evaluation protocols. The results indicate that our quasi-synthetic approach
achieves low error rates, highlighting the potential of generating synthetic
data in Riemannian spaces for writer-independent signature verification
systems.

TL;DR: Seedream 4.0是一个高效的多模态图像生成系统，集成了文本到图像合成、图像编辑和多图像组合功能，采用高效的扩散变换器和优化的VAE，能够快速生成高分辨率图像，在多项任务上达到最先进水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统文本到图像系统功能单一，无法满足复杂的创作需求。Seedream 4.0旨在开发一个统一的框架，将多种图像生成和编辑功能整合在一起，提供更交互式和多维度的创作工具。

Method: 开发高效的扩散变换器配合强大的VAE，大幅减少图像token数量；使用数十亿文本-图像对进行预训练；通过精心调优的VLM模型进行多模态后训练；集成对抗蒸馏、分布匹配、量化和推测解码等推理加速技术。

Conclusion: Seedream 4.0将传统文本到图像系统扩展为更交互式和多维度的创作工具，推动了生成式AI在创意和专业应用领域的边界，现已可通过指定网址访问。

Abstract: We introduce Seedream 4.0, an efficient and high-performance multimodal image
generation system that unifies text-to-image (T2I) synthesis, image editing,
and multi-image composition within a single framework. We develop a highly
efficient diffusion transformer with a powerful VAE which also can reduce the
number of image tokens considerably. This allows for efficient training of our
model, and enables it to fast generate native high-resolution images (e.g.,
1K-4K). Seedream 4.0 is pretrained on billions of text-image pairs spanning
diverse taxonomies and knowledge-centric concepts. Comprehensive data
collection across hundreds of vertical scenarios, coupled with optimized
strategies, ensures stable and large-scale training, with strong
generalization. By incorporating a carefully fine-tuned VLM model, we perform
multi-modal post-training for training both T2I and image editing tasks
jointly. For inference acceleration, we integrate adversarial distillation,
distribution matching, and quantization, as well as speculative decoding. It
achieves an inference time of up to 1.8 seconds for generating a 2K image
(without a LLM/VLM as PE model). Comprehensive evaluations reveal that Seedream
4.0 can achieve state-of-the-art results on both T2I and multimodal image
editing. In particular, it demonstrates exceptional multimodal capabilities in
complex tasks, including precise image editing and in-context reasoning, and
also allows for multi-image reference, and can generate multiple output images.
This extends traditional T2I systems into an more interactive and
multidimensional creative tool, pushing the boundary of generative AI for both
creativity and professional applications. Seedream 4.0 is now accessible on
https://www.volcengine.com/experience/ark?launch=seedream.

### [5] [A Contrastive Learning Framework for Breast Cancer Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20474)
*Samia Saeed,Khuram Naveed*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于对比学习的乳腺癌检测框架，通过半监督学习方法在小规模标注数据集上实现高精度检测，在INbreast和MIAS数据集上达到96.7%的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 乳腺癌是全球第二大癌症死因，早期检测对改善治疗效果至关重要。虽然深度学习在医学影像分析中表现出色，但受限于标注数据不足的问题。本文旨在解决小规模标注数据集下的准确检测挑战。

Method: 采用对比学习框架，使用Resnet-50模型进行半监督学习。通过相似性指数在大规模未标注乳腺X光片数据上训练，并应用多种数据增强和变换技术提升性能，最后在小规模标注数据上进行微调。

Result: 在INbreast和MIAS基准数据集上实现了96.7%的乳腺癌检测准确率，超越了现有最优方法。

Conclusion: 对比学习框架能够有效利用未标注数据，在小规模标注数据集条件下实现高精度的乳腺癌检测，为医学影像分析提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Breast cancer, the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths globally,
accounts for a quarter of all cancer cases [1]. To lower this death rate, it is
crucial to detect tumors early, as early-stage detection significantly improves
treatment outcomes. Advances in non-invasive imaging techniques have made early
detection possible through computer-aided detection (CAD) systems which rely on
traditional image analysis to identify malignancies. However, there is a
growing shift towards deep learning methods due to their superior
effectiveness. Despite their potential, deep learning methods often struggle
with accuracy due to the limited availability of large-labeled datasets for
training. To address this issue, our study introduces a Contrastive Learning
(CL) framework, which excels with smaller labeled datasets. In this regard, we
train Resnet-50 in semi supervised CL approach using similarity index on a
large amount of unlabeled mammogram data. In this regard, we use various
augmentation and transformations which help improve the performance of our
approach. Finally, we tune our model on a small set of labelled data that
outperforms the existing state of the art. Specifically, we observed a 96.7%
accuracy in detecting breast cancer on benchmark datasets INbreast and MIAS.

*Simon Baeuerle,Pratik Khanna,Nils Friederich,Angelo Jovin Yamachui Sitcheu,Damir Shakirov,Andreas Steimer,Ralf Mikut*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文测试了多个基础模型在工业图像质量检测中的应用，发现这些模型在公开数据集上表现良好，但在真实工业数据上全部失败。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用基础模型的零样本泛化能力替代繁琐的人工标注，实现跨产品的自动化质量检测，以节省模型部署成本。

Method: 在定制真实工业图像数据和公开图像数据上测试多个最新基础模型，比较它们在零样本设置下的性能表现。

Result: 所有测试的基础模型在真实工业数据上都失败，而相同的模型在公开基准数据集上表现良好。

Conclusion: 基础模型在工业质量检测场景中的实际应用仍面临挑战，需要进一步研究如何提升其在真实工业环境中的泛化能力。

Abstract: Foundation Models (FMs) have shown impressive performance on various text and
image processing tasks. They can generalize across domains and datasets in a
zero-shot setting. This could make them suitable for automated quality
inspection during series manufacturing, where various types of images are being
evaluated for many different products. Replacing tedious labeling tasks with a
simple text prompt to describe anomalies and utilizing the same models across
many products would save significant efforts during model setup and
implementation. This is a strong advantage over supervised Artificial
Intelligence (AI) models, which are trained for individual applications and
require labeled training data. We test multiple recent FMs on both custom
real-world industrial image data and public image data. We show that all of
those models fail on our real-world data, while the very same models perform
well on public benchmark datasets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出通用神经空间（NS），通过编码器-解码器框架预计算跨视觉和成像任务的特征，实现多任务共享特征空间，减少冗余并提高泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI模型多为特定高精度任务定制，对于包含多个模块化任务的应用效率低下，因为每个任务都需要映射到不同的潜在域。

Method: 使用轻量级CNN骨干网络构建编码器-解码器框架，学习具有变换感知和泛化能力的表示，使多个下游AI模块能在同一特征空间中工作。

Result: 在去马赛克、去噪、深度估计和语义分割等成像和视觉任务上实现了高效性能。

Conclusion: 神经空间架构减少了冗余，提高了跨域泛化能力，为高效多任务视觉管道奠定了基础，相比大型transformer骨干网络更轻量且硬件适应性更广。

Abstract: The majority of AI models in imaging and vision are customized to perform on
specific high-precision task. However, this strategy is inefficient for
applications with a series of modular tasks, since each requires a mapping into
a disparate latent domain. To address this inefficiency, we proposed a
universal Neural Space (NS), where an encoder-decoder framework pre-computes
features across vision and imaging tasks. Our encoder learns transformation
aware, generalizable representations, which enable multiple downstream AI
modules to share the same feature space. This architecture reduces redundancy,
improves generalization across domain shift, and establishes a foundation for
effecient multi-task vision pipelines. Furthermore, as opposed to larger
transformer backbones, our backbone is lightweight and CNN-based, allowing for
wider across hardware. We furthur demonstrate that imaging and vision modules,
such as demosaicing, denoising, depth estimation and semantic segmentation can
be performed efficiently in the NS.

Motivation: 边缘摄像头系统不断扩展，面临不断变化的环境，需要定期更新模型。实践中，复杂教师模型在中央服务器上运行以标注数据，然后用于训练适应边缘设备的小型模型。

Method: 采用高置信度流式策略与基于多样性的方法相结合，选择最有用的图像进行训练。

Result: 在相似的训练负载下，该方法能以最少的数据库查询产生高质量的模型。

Conclusion: 高置信度流式策略与多样性方法的结合是有效的图像选择策略，可在保持低传输成本的同时提高模型质量。

Abstract: Edge camera-based systems are continuously expanding, facing ever-evolving
environments that require regular model updates. In practice, complex teacher
models are run on a central server to annotate data, which is then used to
train smaller models tailored to the edge devices with limited computational
power. This work explores how to select the most useful images for training to
maximize model quality while keeping transmission costs low. Our work shows
that, for a similar training load (i.e., iterations), a high-confidence
stream-based strategy coupled with a diversity-based approach produces a
high-quality model with minimal dataset queries.

*Julien Han,Shuwen Qiu,Qi Li,Xingzi Xu,Mehmet Saygin Seyfioglu,Kavosh Asadi,Karim Bouyarmane*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: InstructVTON是一个基于指令的交互式虚拟试穿系统，通过自然语言指导实现细粒度和复杂的样式控制，支持单件或多件服装试穿。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于掩码的虚拟试穿方法存在局限性：生成理想结果的掩码困难、需要专业知识、模型依赖性强，且在某些复杂样式场景下无法实现（如卷起袖子等）。

Method: 利用视觉语言模型和图像分割模型自动生成二进制掩码，基于用户提供的图像和自由文本样式指令，无需精确绘制掩码，并自动化多轮图像生成。

Result: InstructVTON与现有虚拟试穿模型兼容，实现了具有样式控制的最先进结果。

Conclusion: 该系统简化了终端用户体验，解决了传统掩码方法的局限性，为复杂虚拟试穿场景提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: We present InstructVTON, an instruction-following interactive virtual try-on
system that allows fine-grained and complex styling control of the resulting
generation, guided by natural language, on single or multiple garments. A
computationally efficient and scalable formulation of virtual try-on formulates
the problem as an image-guided or image-conditioned inpainting task. These
inpainting-based virtual try-on models commonly use a binary mask to control
the generation layout. Producing a mask that yields desirable result is
difficult, requires background knowledge, might be model dependent, and in some
cases impossible with the masking-based approach (e.g. trying on a long-sleeve
shirt with "sleeves rolled up" styling on a person wearing long-sleeve shirt
with sleeves down, where the mask will necessarily cover the entire sleeve).
InstructVTON leverages Vision Language Models (VLMs) and image segmentation
models for automated binary mask generation. These masks are generated based on
user-provided images and free-text style instructions. InstructVTON simplifies
the end-user experience by removing the necessity of a precisely drawn mask,
and by automating execution of multiple rounds of image generation for try-on
scenarios that cannot be achieved with masking-based virtual try-on models
alone. We show that InstructVTON is interoperable with existing virtual try-on
models to achieve state-of-the-art results with styling control.

TL;DR: DeepAFRNet是一个深度学习模型，用于识别被篡改的指纹，在SOCOFing数据集上针对三个难度级别实现了高精度识别（96.7%-99.54%），但阈值选择对性能影响很大。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 指纹识别在边境控制、法医学和财政准入等应用中面临篡改指纹的挑战，攻击者可能故意修改脊线模式以逃避检测，因此需要开发能够识别篡改指纹的鲁棒系统。

Method: 使用VGG16骨干网络提取高维特征，通过余弦相似度比较嵌入向量，在SOCOFing Real-Altered数据集的三个难度级别（Easy、Medium、Hard）上进行评估。

Result: 在严格阈值下，DeepAFRNet在三个难度级别上的准确率分别为96.7%、98.76%和99.54%。阈值敏感性研究表明，将阈值从0.92放宽到0.72会导致准确率急剧下降至7.86%、27.05%和29.51%。

Conclusion: DeepAFRNet通过使用真实的篡改样本和报告逐级指标，解决了基于合成篡改或有限验证协议的先前工作的局限性，表明其已准备好用于对安全性和识别弹性都至关重要的实际部署。

Abstract: Altered fingerprint recognition (AFR) is challenging for biometric
verification in applications such as border control, forensics, and fiscal
admission. Adversaries can deliberately modify ridge patterns to evade
detection, so robust recognition of altered prints is essential. We present
DeepAFRNet, a deep learning recognition model that matches and recognizes
distorted fingerprint samples. The approach uses a VGG16 backbone to extract
high-dimensional features and cosine similarity to compare embeddings. We
evaluate on the SOCOFing Real-Altered subset with three difficulty levels
(Easy, Medium, Hard). With strict thresholds, DeepAFRNet achieves accuracies of
96.7 percent, 98.76 percent, and 99.54 percent for the three levels. A
threshold-sensitivity study shows that relaxing the threshold from 0.92 to 0.72
sharply degrades accuracy to 7.86 percent, 27.05 percent, and 29.51 percent,
underscoring the importance of threshold selection in biometric systems. By
using real altered samples and reporting per-level metrics, DeepAFRNet
addresses limitations of prior work based on synthetic alterations or limited
verification protocols, and indicates readiness for real-world deployments
where both security and recognition resilience are critical.

Abstract: We investigate the integration of attention maps from a pre-trained Vision
Transformer into voxel representations to enhance bimanual robotic
manipulation. Specifically, we extract attention maps from DINOv2, a
self-supervised ViT model, and interpret them as pixel-level saliency scores
over RGB images. These maps are lifted into a 3D voxel grid, resulting in
voxel-level semantic cues that are incorporated into a behavior cloning policy.
When integrated into a state-of-the-art voxel-based policy, our
attention-guided featurization yields an average absolute improvement of 8.2%
and a relative gain of 21.9% across all tasks in the RLBench bimanual

Conclusion: 研究为蓝莓检测提供了全面的基准分析，证明了RT-DETR模型的优越性能。半监督学习能有效提升检测精度，但需要进一步研究以更好地利用跨域未标记数据。数据集和软件已公开以支持后续研究。

Abstract: Blueberry detection in natural environments remains challenging due to
variable lighting, occlusions, and motion blur due to environmental factors and
imaging devices. Deep learning-based object detectors promise to address these
challenges, but they demand a large-scale, diverse dataset that captures the
real-world complexities. Moreover, deploying these models in practical
scenarios often requires the right accuracy/speed/memory trade-off in model
selection. This study presents a novel comparative benchmark analysis of
advanced real-time object detectors, including YOLO (You Only Look Once)
(v8-v12) and RT-DETR (Real-Time Detection Transformers) (v1-v2) families,
consisting of 36 model variants, evaluated on a newly curated dataset for
blueberry detection. This dataset comprises 661 canopy images collected with
smartphones during the 2022-2023 seasons, consisting of 85,879 labelled
instances (including 36,256 ripe and 49,623 unripe blueberries) across a wide
range of lighting conditions, occlusions, and fruit maturity stages. Among the
YOLO models, YOLOv12m achieved the best accuracy with a mAP@50 of 93.3%, while
RT-DETRv2-X obtained a mAP@50 of 93.6%, the highest among all the RT-DETR
variants. The inference time varied with the model scale and complexity, and
the mid-sized models appeared to offer a good accuracy-speed balance. To
further enhance detection performance, all the models were fine-tuned using
Unbiased Mean Teacher-based semi-supervised learning (SSL) on a separate set of
1,035 unlabeled images acquired by a ground-based machine vision platform in
2024. This resulted in accuracy gains ranging from -1.4% to 2.9%, with
RT-DETR-v2-X achieving the best mAP@50 of 94.8%. More in-depth research into
SSL is needed to better leverage cross-domain unlabeled data. Both the dataset
and software programs of this study are made publicly available to support
further research.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种轻量级的感兴趣区域（ROI）增强策略，用于提升乳腺X光片分类性能。通过在训练过程中概率性地将完整图像替换为预计算的ROI裁剪，该方法在Mini-DDSM数据集上实现了适度的性能提升，且不增加推理成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 乳腺X光筛查对早期检测和死亡率降低至关重要。深度学习在自动化乳腺X光片解读方面显示出潜力，但有限分辨率的数据集和小样本量限制了性能。需要在不增加额外标签或架构修改的情况下提升分类效果。

Method: 引入轻量级ROI增强策略：训练期间，完整图像以概率p_roi被替换为从预计算的无标签边界框库中随机采样的ROI裁剪，可选抖动增加变异性。该方法仅用于训练，推理成本不变。

Result: 在Mini-DDSM数据集上（最佳参数p_roi=0.10, alpha=0.10），ROI增强带来适度的平均ROC-AUC提升，但性能在不同折叠间有变化；PR-AUC持平或略降。训练效率指标（吞吐量和GPU内存）得到保持。

Conclusion: 简单的、以数据为中心的ROI策略可以在受限环境下增强乳腺X光片分类性能，无需额外标签或架构修改，为数据受限的医学图像分析提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Breast cancer screening with mammography remains central to early detection
and mortality reduction. Deep learning has shown strong potential for
automating mammogram interpretation, yet limited-resolution datasets and small
sample sizes continue to restrict performance. We revisit the Mini-DDSM dataset
(9,684 images; 2,414 patients) and introduce a lightweight region-of-interest
(ROI) augmentation strategy. During training, full images are probabilistically
replaced with random ROI crops sampled from a precomputed, label-free
bounding-box bank, with optional jitter to increase variability. We evaluate
under strict patient-level cross-validation and report ROC-AUC, PR-AUC, and
training-time efficiency metrics (throughput and GPU memory). Because ROI
augmentation is training-only, inference-time cost remains unchanged. On
Mini-DDSM, ROI augmentation (best: p_roi = 0.10, alpha = 0.10) yields modest
average ROC-AUC gains, with performance varying across folds; PR-AUC is flat to
slightly lower. These results demonstrate that simple, data-centric ROI
strategies can enhance mammography classification in constrained settings
without requiring additional labels or architectural modifications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 镜子反射在日常环境中常见，能够同时提供真实视图和反射虚拟视图，可作为立体信息源来简化3D重建的成像过程

Method: 设计变换方法构建物理有效的虚拟相机，直接生成像素域虚拟视图；提出对称感知损失优化姿态估计；框架可扩展到动态场景

Result: 在真实世界和合成数据上的大量实验证明了方法的有效性，提供了包含16个场景的合成数据集用于定量评估

Conclusion: 该方法能够从单张包含镜子反射的图像实现鲁棒的3D重建，简化了成像过程并与前馈重建模型兼容

Abstract: Mirror reflections are common in everyday environments and can provide stereo
information within a single capture, as the real and reflected virtual views
are visible simultaneously. We exploit this property by treating the reflection
as an auxiliary view and designing a transformation that constructs a
physically valid virtual camera, allowing direct pixel-domain generation of the
virtual view while adhering to the real-world imaging process. This enables a
multi-view stereo setup from a single image, simplifying the imaging process,
making it compatible with powerful feed-forward reconstruction models for
generalizable and robust 3D reconstruction. To further exploit the geometric
symmetry introduced by mirrors, we propose a symmetric-aware loss to refine
pose estimation. Our framework also naturally extends to dynamic scenes, where
each frame contains a mirror reflection, enabling efficient per-frame geometry
recovery. For quantitative evaluation, we provide a fully customizable
synthetic dataset of 16 Blender scenes, each with ground-truth point clouds and
camera poses. Extensive experiments on real-world data and synthetic data are
conducted to illustrate the effectiveness of our method.

TL;DR: FacadeTrack是一个街景级别的语言引导框架，通过全景视频与地块关联、立面视图校正和可解释属性提取，用于灾后建筑占用评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 灾后建筑占用评估对于分类、检查、公用事业恢复和资源分配至关重要。高空影像覆盖快但缺乏立面细节，街景影像细节丰富但稀疏且难以与地块对齐。

Method: 提出FacadeTrack框架：链接全景视频到地块，校正立面视图，提取可解释属性（如入口堵塞、临时覆盖物、局部碎片），采用两种决策策略：透明的一阶段规则和将感知与保守推理分离的两阶段设计。

Result: 在两次飓风Helene灾后调查中，两阶段方法达到精度0.927、召回率0.781、F-1分数0.848；一阶段基线为精度0.943、召回率0.728、F-1分数0.822。中间属性和空间诊断揭示了错误来源。

Conclusion: 该管道提供可审计、可扩展的占用评估，适合集成到地理空间和应急管理工作流程中，通过目标质量控制提高评估准确性。

Abstract: Building-level occupancy after disasters is vital for triage, inspections,
utility re-energization, and equitable resource allocation. Overhead imagery
provides rapid coverage but often misses facade and access cues that determine
habitability, while street-view imagery captures those details but is sparse
and difficult to align with parcels. We present FacadeTrack, a street-level,
language-guided framework that links panoramic video to parcels, rectifies
views to facades, and elicits interpretable attributes (for example, entry
blockage, temporary coverings, localized debris) that drive two decision
strategies: a transparent one-stage rule and a two-stage design that separates
perception from conservative reasoning. Evaluated across two post-Hurricane
Helene surveys, the two-stage approach achieves a precision of 0.927, a recall
of 0.781, and an F-1 score of 0.848, compared with the one-stage baseline at a
precision of 0.943, a recall of 0.728, and an F-1 score of 0.822. Beyond
accuracy, intermediate attributes and spatial diagnostics reveal where and why
residual errors occur, enabling targeted quality control. The pipeline provides
auditable, scalable occupancy assessments suitable for integration into
geospatial and emergency-management workflows.

TL;DR: 该研究探讨人类如何通过简单移动形状识别社交互动，发现语义表征对视觉特征具有补充作用，其中基于动词的嵌入最能解释人类相似性判断。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类能够从简单的移动形状中识别各种社交互动，但以往研究多关注视觉特征，本研究旨在探索人类使用哪些语义表征来补充视觉特征。

Method: 研究1让参与者直接标注动画印象；研究2通过人类相似性判断测量27种社交互动的表征几何，并与基于视觉特征、标签和动画描述语义嵌入的模型预测进行比较。

Result: 语义模型为解释人类判断提供了视觉特征之外的补充信息，其中基于动词的嵌入最能解释人类相似性判断。

Conclusion: 简单显示中的社交感知反映了社交互动的语义结构，在视觉和抽象表征之间架起了桥梁。

Abstract: Humans are social creatures who readily recognize various social interactions
from simple display of moving shapes. While previous research has often focused
on visual features, we examine what semantic representations that humans employ
to complement visual features. In Study 1, we directly asked human participants
to label the animations based on their impression of moving shapes. We found
that human responses were distributed. In Study 2, we measured the
representational geometry of 27 social interactions through human similarity
judgments and compared it with model predictions based on visual features,
labels, and semantic embeddings from animation descriptions. We found that
semantic models provided complementary information to visual features in
explaining human judgments. Among the semantic models, verb-based embeddings
extracted from descriptions account for human similarity judgments the best.
These results suggest that social perception in simple displays reflects the
semantic structure of social interactions, bridging visual and abstract
representations.

Conclusion: EGS框架通过结合几何感知特征提取和全局-局部图结构，有效提升了跨视角地理定位的泛化能力和性能。

Abstract: Cross-view geo-localization (CVGL) aims to match images of the same location
captured from drastically different viewpoints. Despite recent progress,
existing methods still face two key challenges: (1) achieving robustness under
severe appearance variations induced by diverse UAV orientations and fields of
view, which hinders cross-domain generalization, and (2) establishing reliable
correspondences that capture both global scene-level semantics and fine-grained
local details. In this paper, we propose EGS, a novel CVGL framework designed
to enhance cross-domain generalization. Specifically, we introduce an
E(2)-Steerable CNN encoder to extract stable and reliable features under
rotation and viewpoint shifts. Furthermore, we construct a graph with a virtual
super-node that connects to all local nodes, enabling global semantics to be
aggregated and redistributed to local regions, thereby enforcing global-local
consistency. Extensive experiments on the University-1652 and SUES-200
benchmarks demonstrate that EGS consistently achieves substantial performance
gains and establishes a new state of the art in cross-domain CVGL.

Conclusion: 所提出的方法通过解耦边缘增强和语义建模，有效解决了红外小目标检测中的关键挑战，实现了精确的目标检测和定位。

Abstract: Infrared small target detection is crucial for remote sensing applications
like disaster warning and maritime surveillance. However, due to the lack of
distinctive texture and morphological features, infrared small targets are
highly susceptible to blending into cluttered and noisy backgrounds. A
fundamental challenge in designing deep models for this task lies in the
inherent conflict between capturing high-resolution spatial details for minute
targets and extracting robust semantic context for larger targets, often
leading to feature misalignment and suboptimal performance. Existing methods
often rely on fixed gradient operators or simplistic attention mechanisms,
which are inadequate for accurately extracting target edges under low contrast
and high noise. In this paper, we propose a novel Dual-Path Edge Network that
explicitly addresses this challenge by decoupling edge enhancement and semantic
modeling into two complementary processing paths. The first path employs a
Bidirectional Interaction Module, which uses both Local Self-Attention and
Global Self-Attention to capture multi-scale local and global feature
dependencies. The global attention mechanism, based on a Transformer
architecture, integrates long-range semantic relationships and contextual
information, ensuring robust scene understanding. The second path introduces
the Multi-Edge Refiner, which enhances fine-grained edge details using cascaded
Taylor finite difference operators at multiple scales. This mathematical
approach, along with an attention-driven gating mechanism, enables precise edge
localization and feature enhancement for targets of varying sizes, while
effectively suppressing noise. Our method provides a promising solution for
precise infrared small target detection and localization, combining structural
semantics and edge refinement in a unified framework.

Abstract: Intention recognition has traditionally focused on individual intentions,
overlooking the complexities of collective intentions in group settings. To
address this limitation, we introduce the concept of group intention, which
represents shared goals emerging through the actions of multiple individuals,
and Group Intention Forecasting (GIF), a novel task that forecasts when group
intentions will occur by analyzing individual actions and interactions before
the collective goal becomes apparent. To investigate GIF in a specific
scenario, we propose SHOT, the first large-scale dataset for GIF, consisting of
1,979 basketball video clips captured from 5 camera views and annotated with 6
types of individual attributes. SHOT is designed with 3 key characteristics:
multi-individual information, multi-view adaptability, and multi-level
intention, making it well-suited for studying emerging group intentions.
Furthermore, we introduce GIFT (Group Intention ForecasTer), a framework that
extracts fine-grained individual features and models evolving group dynamics to
forecast intention emergence. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of
SHOT and GIFT, establishing a strong foundation for future research in group
intention forecasting. The dataset is available at

Abstract: Maritime object detection is essential for navigation safety, surveillance,
and autonomous operations, yet constrained by two key challenges: the scarcity
of annotated maritime data and poor generalization across various maritime
attributes (e.g., object category, viewpoint, location, and imaging
environment). % In particular, models trained on existing datasets often
underperform in underrepresented scenarios such as open-sea environments. To
address these challenges, we propose Neptune-X, a data-centric
generative-selection framework that enhances training effectiveness by
leveraging synthetic data generation with task-aware sample selection. From the
generation perspective, we develop X-to-Maritime, a multi-modality-conditioned
generative model that synthesizes diverse and realistic maritime scenes. A key
component is the Bidirectional Object-Water Attention module, which captures
boundary interactions between objects and their aquatic surroundings to improve
visual fidelity. To further improve downstream tasking performance, we propose
Attribute-correlated Active Sampling, which dynamically selects synthetic
samples based on their task relevance. To support robust benchmarking, we
construct the Maritime Generation Dataset, the first dataset tailored for
generative maritime learning, encompassing a wide range of semantic conditions.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach sets a new benchmark in
maritime scene synthesis, significantly improving detection accuracy,
particularly in challenging and previously underrepresented settings.The code

Motivation: 现有的陨石坑导航技术主要针对短期着陆任务，而长期月球测绘任务面临稀疏、倾斜图像和变化光照条件的挑战，需要开发新的导航解决方案。

Method: STELLA结合了基于Mask R-CNN的陨石坑检测器、无描述符陨石坑识别模块、鲁棒的透视-n-陨石坑位姿求解器和批量轨道确定后端。

Result: 在CRESENT-365数据集上的实验表明，STELLA在各种观测角度、光照条件和月球纬度下平均保持米级位置精度和亚度级姿态精度。

Conclusion: 这是首次在真实月球测绘环境下对陨石坑导航进行全面评估，为未来任务的操作条件提供了重要参考。

Abstract: Crater-Based Navigation (CBN) uses the ubiquitous impact craters of the Moon
observed on images as natural landmarks to determine the six degrees of freedom
pose of a spacecraft. To date, CBN has primarily been studied in the context of
powered descent and landing. These missions are typically short in duration,
with high-frequency imagery captured from a nadir viewpoint over well-lit
terrain. In contrast, lunar mapping missions involve sparse, oblique imagery
acquired under varying illumination conditions over potentially year-long
campaigns, posing significantly greater challenges for pose estimation. We
bridge this gap with STELLA - the first end-to-end CBN pipeline for
long-duration lunar mapping. STELLA combines a Mask R-CNN-based crater
detector, a descriptor-less crater identification module, a robust
perspective-n-crater pose solver, and a batch orbit determination back-end. To
rigorously test STELLA, we introduce CRESENT-365 - the first public dataset
that emulates a year-long lunar mapping mission. Each of its 15,283 images is
rendered from high-resolution digital elevation models with SPICE-derived Sun
angles and Moon motion, delivering realistic global coverage, illumination
cycles, and viewing geometries. Experiments on CRESENT+ and CRESENT-365 show
that STELLA maintains metre-level position accuracy and sub-degree attitude
accuracy on average across wide ranges of viewing angles, illumination
conditions, and lunar latitudes. These results constitute the first
comprehensive assessment of CBN in a true lunar mapping setting and inform
operational conditions that should be considered for future missions.

Conclusion: 单模态网络收敛于共享语义代码，与人类判断一致，且通过示例聚合得到加强。

Abstract: Recent studies show that deep vision-only and language-only models--trained
on disjoint modalities--nonetheless project their inputs into a partially
aligned representational space. Yet we still lack a clear picture of where in
each network this convergence emerges, what visual or linguistic cues support
it, whether it captures human preferences in many-to-many image-text scenarios,
and how aggregating exemplars of the same concept affects alignment. Here, we
systematically investigate these questions. We find that alignment peaks in
mid-to-late layers of both model types, reflecting a shift from
modality-specific to conceptually shared representations. This alignment is
robust to appearance-only changes but collapses when semantics are altered
(e.g., object removal or word-order scrambling), highlighting that the shared
code is truly semantic. Moving beyond the one-to-one image-caption paradigm, a
forced-choice "Pick-a-Pic" task shows that human preferences for image-caption
matches are mirrored in the embedding spaces across all vision-language model
pairs. This pattern holds bidirectionally when multiple captions correspond to
a single image, demonstrating that models capture fine-grained semantic
distinctions akin to human judgments. Surprisingly, averaging embeddings across
exemplars amplifies alignment rather than blurring detail. Together, our
results demonstrate that unimodal networks converge on a shared semantic code
that aligns with human judgments and strengthens with exemplar aggregation.

Motivation: 现有图像编辑方法在个性化对象插入任务中存在三个主要问题：缺乏对插入对象的几何控制、风格一致性不足，以及需要大量训练。这些问题限制了图像编辑的精确性和真实感。

Method: 首先将2D对象转换为3D，在3D层面进行交互式编辑，然后从指定视角重新渲染为2D图像。通过扩散适配器结合几何控制、风格和内容控制，最终生成几何可控、风格一致的编辑图像。

Result: 该方法能够实现对插入对象的精确几何控制（如形状和视角），同时保持与背景的风格一致性，无需进行大量训练即可完成高质量的对象插入。

Conclusion: FreeInsert通过引入3D几何信息，有效解决了图像编辑中的几何控制和风格一致性问题，为个性化对象插入提供了一种高效且无需训练的解决方案。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have made significant progress in image
generation, allowing for effortless customized generation. However, existing
image editing methods still face certain limitations when dealing with
personalized image composition tasks. First, there is the issue of lack of
geometric control over the inserted objects. Current methods are confined to 2D
space and typically rely on textual instructions, making it challenging to
maintain precise geometric control over the objects. Second, there is the
challenge of style consistency. Existing methods often overlook the style
consistency between the inserted object and the background, resulting in a lack
of realism. In addition, the challenge of inserting objects into images without
extensive training remains significant. To address these issues, we propose
\textit{FreeInsert}, a novel training-free framework that customizes object
insertion into arbitrary scenes by leveraging 3D geometric information.
Benefiting from the advances in existing 3D generation models, we first convert
the 2D object into 3D, perform interactive editing at the 3D level, and then
re-render it into a 2D image from a specified view. This process introduces
geometric controls such as shape or view. The rendered image, serving as
geometric control, is combined with style and content control achieved through
diffusion adapters, ultimately producing geometrically controlled,
style-consistent edited images via the diffusion model.

Abstract: Recently remarkable progress has been made in synthesizing realistic human
photos using text-to-image diffusion models. However, current approaches face
degraded scenes, insufficient control, and suboptimal perceptual identity. We
introduce CustomEnhancer, a novel framework to augment existing identity
customization models. CustomEnhancer is a zero-shot enhancement pipeline that
leverages face swapping techniques, pretrained diffusion model, to obtain
additional representations in a zeroshot manner for encoding into personalized
models. Through our proposed triple-flow fused PerGeneration approach, which
identifies and combines two compatible counter-directional latent spaces to
manipulate a pivotal space of personalized model, we unify the generation and
reconstruction processes, realizing generation from three flows. Our pipeline
also enables comprehensive training-free control over the generation process of
personalized models, offering precise controlled personalization for them and
eliminating the need for controller retraining for per-model. Besides, to
address the high time complexity of null-text inversion (NTI), we introduce
ResInversion, a novel inversion method that performs noise rectification via a
pre-diffusion mechanism, reducing the inversion time by 129 times. Experiments
demonstrate that CustomEnhancer reach SOTA results at scene diversity, identity
fidelity, training-free controls, while also showing the efficiency of our
ResInversion over NTI. The code will be made publicly available upon paper
acceptance.

platform incorporated with standard codecs (under development) by examining the
compression gain on several datasets in terms of bit-rate versus task accuracy.
This evaluation platform has been developed as open-source software and is

Abstract: Semi-supervised domain generalization (SSDG) in medical image segmentation
offers a promising solution for generalizing to unseen domains during testing,
addressing domain shift challenges and minimizing annotation costs. However,
conventional SSDG methods assume labeled and unlabeled data are available for
each source domain in the training set, a condition that is not always met in
practice. The coexistence of limited annotation and domain shift in the
training set is a prevalent issue. Thus, this paper explores a more practical
and challenging scenario, cross-domain semi-supervised domain generalization
(CD-SSDG), where domain shifts occur between labeled and unlabeled training
data, in addition to shifts between training and testing sets. Existing SSDG
methods exhibit sub-optimal performance under such domain shifts because of
inaccurate pseudolabels. To address this issue, we propose a novel
dual-supervised asymmetric co-training (DAC) framework tailored for CD-SSDG.
Building upon the co-training paradigm with two sub-models offering cross
pseudo supervision, our DAC framework integrates extra feature-level
supervision and asymmetric auxiliary tasks for each sub-model. This
feature-level supervision serves to address inaccurate pseudo supervision
caused by domain shifts between labeled and unlabeled data, utilizing
complementary supervision from the rich feature space. Additionally, two
distinct auxiliary self-supervised tasks are integrated into each sub-model to
enhance domain-invariant discriminative feature learning and prevent model
collapse. Extensive experiments on real-world medical image segmentation
datasets, i.e., Fundus, Polyp, and SCGM, demonstrate the robust
generalizability of the proposed DAC framework.

*Shihua Huang,Yongjie Hou,Longfei Liu,Xuanlong Yu,Xi Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DEIMv2是基于DEIM框架的扩展，通过集成DINOv3特征和引入空间调谐适配器(STA)，实现了从X到Atto八个模型规模的实时目标检测，在不同计算资源下都达到了优异的性能-成本平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了在保持DEIM框架简单有效的同时，进一步提升实时DETRs的性能，并覆盖从GPU到移动端的多样化部署场景。

Method: 对于X/L/M/S模型采用DINOv3预训练或蒸馏的骨干网络，并引入STA将单尺度输出转换为多尺度特征；对于超轻量模型使用HGNetv2并进行深度和宽度剪枝，配合简化解码器和升级的Dense O2O。

Result: DEIMv2-X仅用50.3M参数达到57.8 AP，超越需要60M+参数的同类模型；DEIMv2-S成为首个参数量低于10M但AP超过50的模型(50.9 AP)；DEIMv2-Pico仅用1.5M参数达到38.5 AP，性能与参数量多50%的YOLOv10-Nano相当。

Conclusion: DEIMv2通过统一的设计框架，在不同规模模型上都实现了优越的性能-成本权衡，建立了实时目标检测的新标杆。

Abstract: Benefiting from the simplicity and effectiveness of Dense O2O and MAL, DEIM
has become the mainstream training framework for real-time DETRs, significantly
outperforming the YOLO series. In this work, we extend it with DINOv3 features,
resulting in DEIMv2. DEIMv2 spans eight model sizes from X to Atto, covering
GPU, edge, and mobile deployment. For the X, L, M, and S variants, we adopt
DINOv3-pretrained or distilled backbones and introduce a Spatial Tuning Adapter
(STA), which efficiently converts DINOv3's single-scale output into multi-scale
features and complements strong semantics with fine-grained details to enhance
detection. For ultra-lightweight models (Nano, Pico, Femto, and Atto), we
employ HGNetv2 with depth and width pruning to meet strict resource budgets.
Together with a simplified decoder and an upgraded Dense O2O, this unified
design enables DEIMv2 to achieve a superior performance-cost trade-off across
diverse scenarios, establishing new state-of-the-art results. Notably, our
largest model, DEIMv2-X, achieves 57.8 AP with only 50.3 million parameters,
surpassing prior X-scale models that require over 60 million parameters for
just 56.5 AP. On the compact side, DEIMv2-S is the first sub-10 million model
(9.71 million) to exceed the 50 AP milestone on COCO, reaching 50.9 AP. Even
the ultra-lightweight DEIMv2-Pico, with just 1.5 million parameters, delivers
38.5 AP, matching YOLOv10-Nano (2.3 million) with around 50 percent fewer
parameters.

*Ved Umrajkar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DAC-LoRA是一种将对抗训练集成到参数高效微调(PEFT)中的新框架，通过动态对抗课程学习提升视觉语言模型的对抗鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型(VLMs)在关键应用中广泛使用，但即使使用LoRA等参数高效微调方法，这些模型仍然容易受到对抗攻击的威胁，可能影响安全关键决策。CLIP作为下游VLM的骨干网络，其脆弱性可能在整个多模态AI生态系统中产生连锁反应。

Method: 提出DAC-LoRA框架，核心原理是智能的渐进式挑战攻击课程。该方法基于一阶平稳条件(FOSC)和TRADES启发的损失函数，可以应用于任何迭代攻击方法。该框架可以轻松集成到标准PEFT流程中。

Result: DAC-LoRA在对抗鲁棒性方面取得了显著改进，同时没有显著损害干净数据的准确性。

Conclusion: DAC-LoRA提供了一种有效、轻量级且广泛适用的方法，通过将对抗训练集成到PEFT中，显著增强了模型的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are foundational to critical applications like
autonomous driving, medical diagnosis, and content moderation. While
Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods like LoRA enable their efficient
adaptation to specialized tasks, these models remain vulnerable to adversarial
attacks that can compromise safety-critical decisions. CLIP, the backbone for
numerous downstream VLMs, is a high-value target whose vulnerabilities can
cascade across the multimodal AI ecosystem. We propose Dynamic Adversarial
Curriculum DAC-LoRA, a novel framework that integrates adversarial training
into PEFT. The core principle of our method i.e. an intelligent curriculum of
progressively challenging attack, is general and can potentially be applied to
any iterative attack method. Guided by the First-Order Stationary Condition
(FOSC) and a TRADES-inspired loss, DAC-LoRA achieves substantial improvements
in adversarial robustness without significantly compromising clean accuracy.
Our work presents an effective, lightweight, and broadly applicable method to
demonstrate that the DAC-LoRA framework can be easily integrated into a
standard PEFT pipeline to significantly enhance robustness.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为FedDSPG的新方法，通过生成式视角处理联邦域泛化任务，利用领域特定软提示生成来提升模型在未知领域的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于提示学习的联邦域泛化方法存在提示多样性有限、忽略未知领域信息的问题，需要更有效的方法来处理客户端间的域偏移挑战。

Method: FedDSPG方法在训练阶段为每个领域引入领域特定软提示，将内容和领域知识整合到客户端间的生成模型中；在推理阶段使用生成器获取未见目标领域的软提示来指导下游任务。

Result: 在多个公共数据集上的综合评估表明，该方法在联邦域泛化任务中优于现有强基线，达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 从生成式视角提出的FedDSPG方法有效解决了联邦学习中域泛化问题，通过领域特定软提示生成显著提升了模型在未知领域的适应能力。

Abstract: Prompt learning has become an efficient paradigm for adapting CLIP to
downstream tasks. Compared with traditional fine-tuning, prompt learning
optimizes a few parameters yet yields highly competitive results, especially
appealing in federated learning for computational efficiency. engendering
domain shift among clients and posing a formidable challenge for
downstream-task adaptation. Existing federated domain generalization (FDG)
methods based on prompt learning typically learn soft prompts from training
samples, replacing manually designed prompts to enhance the generalization
ability of federated models. However, these learned prompts exhibit limited
diversity and tend to ignore information from unknown domains. We propose a
novel and effective method from a generative perspective for handling FDG
tasks, namely federated domain generalization with domain-specific soft prompts
generation (FedDSPG). Specifically, during training, we introduce
domain-specific soft prompts (DSPs) for each domain and integrate content and
domain knowledge into the generative model among clients. In the inference
phase, the generator is utilized to obtain DSPs for unseen target domains, thus
guiding downstream tasks in unknown domains. Comprehensive evaluations across
several public datasets confirm that our method outperforms existing strong
baselines in FDG, achieving state-of-the-art results.

Abstract: Low back pain affects millions worldwide, driving the need for robust
diagnostic models that can jointly analyze complex medical images and
accompanying text reports. We present LumbarCLIP, a novel multimodal framework
that leverages contrastive language-image pretraining to align lumbar spine MRI
scans with corresponding radiological descriptions. Built upon a curated
dataset containing axial MRI views paired with expert-written reports,
LumbarCLIP integrates vision encoders (ResNet-50, Vision Transformer, Swin
Transformer) with a BERT-based text encoder to extract dense representations.
These are projected into a shared embedding space via learnable projection
heads, configurable as linear or non-linear, and normalized to facilitate
stable contrastive training using a soft CLIP loss. Our model achieves
state-of-the-art performance on downstream classification, reaching up to
95.00% accuracy and 94.75% F1-score on the test set, despite inherent class
imbalance. Extensive ablation studies demonstrate that linear projection heads
yield more effective cross-modal alignment than non-linear variants. LumbarCLIP
offers a promising foundation for automated musculoskeletal diagnosis and
clinical decision support.

TL;DR: PoisonVID是首个针对VideoLLMs中提示引导采样机制的黑盒中毒攻击，通过闭环优化策略在三个VideoLLMs上实现82%-99%的攻击成功率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然早期帧采样策略的漏洞已被识别，但提示引导采样策略的安全性尚未被探索，存在安全风险

Method: 采用闭环优化策略，通过从影子VideoLLM和GPT-4o-mini构建的描述集迭代优化通用扰动，抑制有害帧相关性分数

Result: 在三种提示引导采样策略和三个先进VideoLLMs上，攻击成功率达到82%-99%

Conclusion: 研究结果强调了为VideoLLMs开发未来先进采样策略的重要性

Abstract: Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for
understanding videos, supporting tasks such as summarization, captioning, and
question answering. Their performance has been driven by advances in frame
sampling, progressing from uniform-based to semantic-similarity-based and, most
recently, prompt-guided strategies. While vulnerabilities have been identified
in earlier sampling strategies, the safety of prompt-guided sampling remains
unexplored. We close this gap by presenting PoisonVID, the first black-box
poisoning attack that undermines prompt-guided sampling in VideoLLMs. PoisonVID
compromises the underlying prompt-guided sampling mechanism through a
closed-loop optimization strategy that iteratively optimizes a universal
perturbation to suppress harmful frame relevance scores, guided by a depiction
set constructed from paraphrased harmful descriptions leveraging a shadow
VideoLLM and a lightweight language model, i.e., GPT-4o-mini. Comprehensively
evaluated on three prompt-guided sampling strategies and across three advanced
VideoLLMs, PoisonVID achieves 82% - 99% attack success rate, highlighting the
importance of developing future advanced sampling strategies for VideoLLMs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GoR是一种新颖的可学习正则化方法，通过动态损失加权自适应平衡任务特定和知识蒸馏目标，解决量化感知训练中梯度冲突问题，提升小量化模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有QAT-KD方法在低比特量化下难以平衡任务特定损失和蒸馏损失，存在异质梯度幅度问题。

Method: 提出GoR方法，仅使用两个可训练参数进行动态损失加权，减少监督信号冲突；并引入QAT-EKD-GoR集成蒸馏框架，使用多个异质教师模型。

Result: 在图像分类、目标检测和LLM压缩实验中，GoR一致优于最先进的QAT-KD方法，在低功耗边缘设备上实现更快推理同时保持全精度准确性。

Conclusion: GoR为量化模型压缩提供了鲁棒解决方案，在最优条件下甚至能超越全精度模型性能。

Abstract: Quantization-aware training (QAT) combined with knowledge distillation (KD)
is a promising strategy for compressing Artificial Intelligence (AI) models for
deployment on resource-constrained hardware. However, existing QAT-KD methods
often struggle to balance task-specific (TS) and distillation losses due to
heterogeneous gradient magnitudes, especially under low-bit quantization. We
propose Game of Regularizer (GoR), a novel learnable regularization method that
adaptively balances TS and KD objectives using only two trainable parameters
for dynamic loss weighting. GoR reduces conflict between supervision signals,
improves convergence, and boosts the performance of small quantized models
(SQMs). Experiments on image classification, object detection (OD), and large
language model (LLM) compression show that GoR consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art QAT-KD methods. On low-power edge devices, it delivers faster
inference while maintaining full-precision accuracy. We also introduce
QAT-EKD-GoR, an ensemble distillation framework that uses multiple
heterogeneous teacher models. Under optimal conditions, the proposed EKD-GoR
can outperform full-precision models, providing a robust solution for
real-world deployment.

Motivation: 评估大规模网络收集的含标签错误的噪声训练数据能否与专家验证的小规模训练数据相竞争，以推动自动化植物识别系统的发展

Method: 使用来自不同数据源的训练集：网络收集的噪声数据和专家验证的清洁数据，测试集来自Pl@ntNet移动应用收集的植物图像查询

Result: 挑战赛评估了不同训练策略在植物识别任务中的表现，为大规模植物识别系统提供了重要参考

Conclusion: 该挑战赛是自动化植物识别系统发展的重要里程碑，为处理大规模噪声数据提供了有价值的评估框架

Abstract: The 2017-th edition of the LifeCLEF plant identification challenge is an
important milestone towards automated plant identification systems working at
the scale of continental floras with 10.000 plant species living mainly in
Europe and North America illustrated by a total of 1.1M images. Nowadays, such
ambitious systems are enabled thanks to the conjunction of the dazzling recent
progress in image classification with deep learning and several outstanding
international initiatives, such as the Encyclopedia of Life (EOL), aggregating
the visual knowledge on plant species coming from the main national botany
institutes. However, despite all these efforts the majority of the plant
species still remain without pictures or are poorly illustrated. Outside the
institutional channels, a much larger number of plant pictures are available
and spread on the web through botanist blogs, plant lovers web-pages, image
hosting websites and on-line plant retailers. The LifeCLEF 2017 plant challenge
presented in this paper aimed at evaluating to what extent a large noisy
training dataset collected through the web and containing a lot of labelling
errors can compete with a smaller but trusted training dataset checked by
experts. To fairly compare both training strategies, the test dataset was
created from a third data source, i.e. the Pl@ntNet mobile application that
collects millions of plant image queries all over the world. This paper
presents more precisely the resources and assessments of the challenge,
summarizes the approaches and systems employed by the participating research
groups, and provides an analysis of the main outcomes.

TL;DR: 本文提出TasselNetV4模型，将植物计数从物种特定计数转向跨物种计数，结合TasselNet的局部计数思想和类无关计数中的提取-匹配范式，在跨场景、跨尺度和跨物种植物计数方面表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 植物具有生物多样性，每年都有新品种被培育，不可能为所有物种构建依赖物种的计数模型。现有类无关计数模型对非刚性结构的植物计数效果不佳，需要重新思考植物计数的问题表述。

Method: 基于普通视觉Transformer构建TasselNetV4，结合TasselNet的局部计数思想和类无关计数的提取-匹配范式，引入多分支框感知局部计数器以增强跨尺度鲁棒性。

Result: 在PAC-105和PAC-Somalia两个挑战性数据集上的实验表明，TasselNetV4不仅实现了优异的计数性能，还具有高效率。

Conclusion: TasselNetV4成为跨场景、跨尺度和跨物种植物计量的视觉基础模型。

Abstract: Accurate plant counting provides valuable information for agriculture such as
crop yield prediction, plant density assessment, and phenotype quantification.
Vision-based approaches are currently the mainstream solution. Prior art
typically uses a detection or a regression model to count a specific plant.
However, plants have biodiversity, and new cultivars are increasingly bred each
year. It is almost impossible to exhaust and build all species-dependent
counting models. Inspired by class-agnostic counting (CAC) in computer vision,
we argue that it is time to rethink the problem formulation of plant counting,
from what plants to count to how to count plants. In contrast to most daily
objects with spatial and temporal invariance, plants are dynamic, changing with
time and space. Their non-rigid structure often leads to worse performance than
counting rigid instances like heads and cars such that current CAC and
open-world detection models are suboptimal to count plants. In this work, we
inherit the vein of the TasselNet plant counting model and introduce a new
extension, TasselNetV4, shifting from species-specific counting to
cross-species counting. TasselNetV4 marries the local counting idea of
TasselNet with the extract-and-match paradigm in CAC. It builds upon a plain
vision transformer and incorporates novel multi-branch box-aware local counters
used to enhance cross-scale robustness. Two challenging datasets, PAC-105 and
PAC-Somalia, are harvested. Extensive experiments against state-of-the-art CAC
models show that TasselNetV4 achieves not only superior counting performance
but also high efficiency.Our results indicate that TasselNetV4 emerges to be a
vision foundation model for cross-scene, cross-scale, and cross-species plant
counting.

Method: 引入完全可微分的生物标志物拓扑引擎，实现层和病变的双向影响联合学习，利用未标记和部分标记数据集，学习解耦的空间和风格因子表示。

Result: 在公共和内部OCT数据集上的评估表明，该方法在病变和层分割方面均优于当前最先进方法，并能将层分割泛化到病理病例。

Conclusion: 该方法展示了在视网膜生物标志物分割中使用解剖学约束进行半监督学习的潜力，可实现准确、鲁棒和可信的分割。

Abstract: Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is widely used for diagnosing and
monitoring retinal diseases, such as age-related macular degeneration (AMD).
The segmentation of biomarkers such as layers and lesions is essential for
patient diagnosis and follow-up. Recently, semi-supervised learning has shown
promise in improving retinal segmentation performance. However, existing
methods often produce anatomically implausible segmentations, fail to
effectively model layer-lesion interactions, and lack guarantees on topological
correctness.
  To address these limitations, we propose a novel semi-supervised model that
introduces a fully differentiable biomarker topology engine to enforce
anatomically correct segmentation of lesions and layers. This enables joint
learning with bidirectional influence between layers and lesions, leveraging
unlabeled and diverse partially labeled datasets. Our model learns a
disentangled representation, separating spatial and style factors. This
approach enables more realistic layer segmentations and improves lesion
segmentation, while strictly enforcing lesion location in their anatomically
plausible positions relative to the segmented layers.
  We evaluate the proposed model on public and internal datasets of OCT scans
and show that it outperforms the current state-of-the-art in both lesion and
layer segmentation, while demonstrating the ability to generalize layer
segmentation to pathological cases using partially annotated training data. Our
results demonstrate the potential of using anatomical constraints in
semi-supervised learning for accurate, robust, and trustworthy retinal
biomarker segmentation.

Abstract: The LifeCLEF plant identification challenge aims at evaluating plant
identification methods and systems at a very large scale, close to the
conditions of a real-world biodiversity monitoring scenario. The 2016-th
edition was actually conducted on a set of more than 110K images illustrating
1000 plant species living in West Europe, built through a large-scale
participatory sensing platform initiated in 2011 and which now involves tens of
thousands of contributors. The main novelty over the previous years is that the
identification task was evaluated as an open-set recognition problem, i.e. a
problem in which the recognition system has to be robust to unknown and never
seen categories. Beyond the brute-force classification across the known classes
of the training set, the big challenge was thus to automatically reject the
false positive classification hits that are caused by the unknown classes. This
overview presents more precisely the resources and assessments of the
challenge, summarizes the approaches and systems employed by the participating
research groups, and provides an analysis of the main outcomes.

TL;DR: SCRA-VQA是一种基于知识库的视觉问答方法，通过总结和重排序图像描述来提升大语言模型的理解能力，无需昂贵的端到端训练即可在OK-VQA和A-OKVQA数据集上取得优异表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法使用大语言模型作为知识引擎，但图像描述包含过多与问题无关的噪声，且LLMs通常不理解VQA任务，限制了其推理能力。

Method: 使用预训练视觉语言模型将图像转换为描述，生成上下文示例并对描述进行总结和重排序，排除无关信息，帮助LLMs更好地理解图像和问题。

Result: 在6.7B参数的LLM上，SCRA-VQA在OK-VQA和A-OKVQA数据集上分别达到38.8%和34.6%的准确率。

Conclusion: SCRA-VQA通过描述重排序过程有效提升了LLMs对图像信息的理解和任务适应性，无需昂贵的端到端训练即可显著提升性能。

Abstract: Acquiring high-quality knowledge is a central focus in Knowledge-Based Visual
Question Answering (KB-VQA). Recent methods use large language models (LLMs) as
knowledge engines for answering. These methods generally employ image captions
as visual text descriptions to assist LLMs in interpreting images. However, the
captions frequently include excessive noise irrelevant to the question, and
LLMs generally do not comprehend VQA tasks, limiting their reasoning
capabilities. To address this issue, we propose the Summarized Caption-Rerank
Augmented VQA (SCRA-VQA), which employs a pre-trained visual language model to
convert images into captions. Moreover, SCRA-VQA generates contextual examples
for the captions while simultaneously summarizing and reordering them to
exclude unrelated information. The caption-rerank process enables LLMs to
understand the image information and questions better, thus enhancing the
model's reasoning ability and task adaptability without expensive end-to-end
training. Based on an LLM with 6.7B parameters, SCRA-VQA performs excellently
on two challenging knowledge-based VQA datasets: OK-VQA and A-OKVQA, achieving
accuracies of 38.8% and 34.6%. Our code is available at

TL;DR: 本文揭示了感知优化与图像质量评估之间的不对称性：在IQA中表现优秀的保真度指标不一定适用于感知优化，这种不一致性在对抗训练中更加明显。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索感知优化目标（保真度目标和对抗目标）作为优化目标的有效性与它们作为图像质量评估指标能力之间的相关性，这一领域尚未得到充分研究。

Method: 通过系统分析，比较不同保真度指标在感知优化和IQA中的表现差异，并研究判别器设计对优化效果的影响。

Result: 发现保真度指标在IQA和优化中的有效性存在明显不对称；判别器设计对优化效果起决定性作用，补丁级和卷积架构比传统或基于Transformer的替代方案提供更忠实细节重建。

Conclusion: 这些发现推进了对损失函数设计及其与IQA可转移性连接的理解，为更原则性的感知优化方法铺平了道路。

Abstract: Perceptual optimization is primarily driven by the fidelity objective, which
enforces both semantic consistency and overall visual realism, while the
adversarial objective provides complementary refinement by enhancing perceptual
sharpness and fine-grained detail. Despite their central role, the correlation
between their effectiveness as optimization objectives and their capability as
image quality assessment (IQA) metrics remains underexplored. In this work, we
conduct a systematic analysis and reveal an unanticipated asymmetry between
perceptual optimization and assessment: fidelity metrics that excel in IQA are
not necessarily effective for perceptual optimization, with this misalignment
emerging more distinctly under adversarial training. In addition, while
discriminators effectively suppress artifacts during optimization, their
learned representations offer only limited benefits when reused as backbone
initializations for IQA models. Beyond this asymmetry, our findings further
demonstrate that discriminator design plays a decisive role in shaping
optimization, with patch-level and convolutional architectures providing more
faithful detail reconstruction than vanilla or Transformer-based alternatives.
These insights advance the understanding of loss function design and its
connection to IQA transferability, paving the way for more principled
approaches to perceptual optimization.

Abstract: Visual Question Answering (VQA) presents a unique challenge by requiring
models to understand and reason about visual content to answer questions
accurately. Existing VQA models often struggle with biases introduced by the
training data, leading to over-reliance on superficial patterns and inadequate
generalization to diverse questions and images. This paper presents a novel
model, IOG-VQA, which integrates Object Interaction Self-Attention and
GAN-Based Debiasing to enhance VQA model performance. The self-attention
mechanism allows our model to capture complex interactions between objects
within an image, providing a more comprehensive understanding of the visual
context. Meanwhile, the GAN-based debiasing framework generates unbiased data
distributions, helping the model to learn more robust and generalizable
features. By leveraging these two components, IOG-VQA effectively combines
visual and textual information to address the inherent biases in VQA datasets.
Extensive experiments on the VQA-CP v1 and VQA-CP v2 datasets demonstrate that
our model shows excellent performance compared with the existing methods,
particularly in handling biased and imbalanced data distributions highlighting
the importance of addressing both object interactions and dataset biases in
advancing VQA tasks. Our code is available at

*Tristan S. W. Stevens,Oisín Nolan,Jean-Luc Robert,Ruud J. G. van Sloun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合低秩时间建模和扩散后验采样的混合框架（Nuclear Diffusion），用于视频去噪，在心脏超声去雾任务中表现优于传统RPCA方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频序列中的结构化噪声和背景伪影会掩盖动态内容，传统RPCA方法的稀疏性假设难以捕捉真实视频数据的丰富变异性。

Method: 将低秩时间建模与扩散后验采样相结合，通过核范数约束和扩散生成先验来提升视频恢复质量。

Result: 在心脏超声去雾任务中，相比传统RPCA方法，在对比度增强（gCNR）和信号保持（KS统计量）方面表现出更好的去雾性能。

Conclusion: 结合基于模型的时间模型和深度生成先验，为高保真视频恢复提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Video sequences often contain structured noise and background artifacts that
obscure dynamic content, posing challenges for accurate analysis and
restoration. Robust principal component methods address this by decomposing
data into low-rank and sparse components. Still, the sparsity assumption often
fails to capture the rich variability present in real video data. To overcome
this limitation, a hybrid framework that integrates low-rank temporal modeling
with diffusion posterior sampling is proposed. The proposed method, Nuclear
Diffusion, is evaluated on a real-world medical imaging problem, namely cardiac
ultrasound dehazing, and demonstrates improved dehazing performance compared to
traditional RPCA concerning contrast enhancement (gCNR) and signal preservation
(KS statistic). These results highlight the potential of combining model-based
temporal models with deep generative priors for high-fidelity video
restoration.

TL;DR: 该论文提出FerretNet，一种轻量级神经网络，通过分析合成图像生成过程中的潜在分布偏差和解码平滑效应，实现高效的合成图像检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着VAEs、GANs和LDMs等先进模型生成的合成图像越来越逼真，合成图像检测面临重大挑战。论文旨在解决这一问题，探索生成过程中引入的两种伪影类型。

Method: 利用马尔可夫随机场的局部像素依赖特性重建合成图像，暴露纹理连续性和边缘一致性的破坏。基于此提出FerretNet，一个仅110万参数的轻量级神经网络。

Result: 在包含22个生成模型的开放世界基准测试中，仅使用4类ProGAN数据集训练的FerretNet平均准确率达到97.1%，比现有最优方法高出10.6%。

Conclusion: FerretNet通过分析生成过程中的特定伪影，实现了高效且鲁棒的合成图像检测，在轻量级架构下取得了显著的性能提升。

Abstract: The increasing realism of synthetic images generated by advanced models such
as VAEs, GANs, and LDMs poses significant challenges for synthetic image
detection. To address this issue, we explore two artifact types introduced
during the generation process: (1) latent distribution deviations and (2)
decoding-induced smoothing effects, which manifest as inconsistencies in local
textures, edges, and color transitions. Leveraging local pixel dependencies
(LPD) properties rooted in Markov Random Fields, we reconstruct synthetic
images using neighboring pixel information to expose disruptions in texture
continuity and edge coherence. Building upon LPD, we propose FerretNet, a
lightweight neural network with only 1.1M parameters that delivers efficient
and robust synthetic image detection. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
FerretNet, trained exclusively on the 4-class ProGAN dataset, achieves an
average accuracy of 97.1% on an open-world benchmark comprising across 22
generative models, surpassing state-of-the-art methods by 10.6%.

*Patrick Knab,Sascha Marton,Philipp J. Schubert,Drago Guggiana,Christian Bartelt*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MoTIF是一个基于概念瓶颈模型的视频分类框架，通过处理视频中的时间依赖性来提升可解释性，支持全局概念重要性、局部概念相关性和时间依赖性的分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的概念瓶颈模型主要针对静态图像，难以处理视频数据中的时间依赖性，而视频中的动作和事件理解需要捕捉时间维度的概念变化。

Method: 提出MoTIF框架，采用transformer架构处理任意长度视频序列，将概念定义为跨时间重复出现的语义实体（如物体、属性、动作组件），形成描述动作的motif模式。

Result: 实验表明概念建模范式可以有效地迁移到视频数据，在保持竞争力的分类性能的同时，能够更好地理解时间上下文中的概念贡献。

Conclusion: MoTIF成功地将概念瓶颈模型扩展到视频领域，为视频分类提供了三个互补的可解释性视角，增强了时间维度上的概念理解能力。

Abstract: Conceptual models such as Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) have driven
substantial progress in improving interpretability for image classification by
leveraging human-interpretable concepts. However, extending these models from
static images to sequences of images, such as video data, introduces a
significant challenge due to the temporal dependencies inherent in videos,
which are essential for capturing actions and events. In this work, we
introduce MoTIF (Moving Temporal Interpretable Framework), an architectural
design inspired by a transformer that adapts the concept bottleneck framework
for video classification and handles sequences of arbitrary length. Within the
video domain, concepts refer to semantic entities such as objects, attributes,
or higher-level components (e.g., 'bow', 'mount', 'shoot') that reoccur across
time - forming motifs collectively describing and explaining actions. Our
design explicitly enables three complementary perspectives: global concept
importance across the entire video, local concept relevance within specific
windows, and temporal dependencies of a concept over time. Our results
demonstrate that the concept-based modeling paradigm can be effectively
transferred to video data, enabling a better understanding of concept
contributions in temporal contexts while maintaining competitive performance.

unique strengths of visible and thermal imagery using deformable attention, the
proposed method demonstrates robust adaptability in complex illumination and

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在远距离物体监控或计算资源受限的任务中，传统的密集深度估计和3D场景重建方法不可行，需要一种更高效的定位解决方案。

Method: 使用粒子滤波器处理相机姿态和图像分割序列，实现单目标和多目标场景下的3D定位，该方法与检测方法无关，具有灵活性。

Result: 通过3D仿真和基于GNSS的无人机图像分割序列验证，粒子滤波器能够有效解决其他方法无法处理的实用定位任务。

Conclusion: 该方法证明了无人机野火监测可以通过粒子滤波器与现有图像分割模型结合来实现，为安全关键监控任务提供了可行方案。

Abstract: 3D object localisation based on a sequence of camera measurements is
essential for safety-critical surveillance tasks, such as drone-based wildfire
monitoring. Localisation of objects detected with a camera can typically be
solved with dense depth estimation or 3D scene reconstruction. However, in the
context of distant objects or tasks limited by the amount of available
computational resources, neither solution is feasible. In this paper, we show
that the task can be solved using particle filters for both single and multiple
target scenarios. The method was studied using a 3D simulation and a
drone-based image segmentation sequence with global navigation satellite system
(GNSS)-based camera pose estimates. The results showed that a particle filter
can be used to solve practical localisation tasks based on camera poses and
image segments in these situations where other solutions fail. The particle
filter is independent of the detection method, making it flexible for new
tasks. The study also demonstrates that drone-based wildfire monitoring can be
conducted using the proposed method paired with a pre-existing image
segmentation model.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出SwinMamba框架，结合局部Mamba扫描和全局感受野，解决Vision Mamba在遥感图像语义分割中忽略局部特征的问题，在LoveDA和ISPRS Potsdam数据集上表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 遥感图像语义分割面临高空间分辨率、复杂场景结构和多尺度对象等挑战。Vision Mamba虽然具有全局感受野和低计算复杂度，但依赖全局扫描会忽略对分割至关重要的局部特征（如纹理和边缘）。

Method: SwinMamba框架受Swin Transformer启发，在前两个阶段进行局部扫描捕获细粒度细节，后两个阶段利用全局扫描融合上下文信息。采用重叠移位窗口增强区域间信息交换，实现更鲁棒的特征整合。

Result: 在LoveDA和ISPRS Potsdam数据集上的大量实验表明，SwinMamba优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: SwinMamba通过结合局部和全局特征感知，为遥感图像语义分割提供了有效的解决方案，展现出优越的性能和潜力。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation of remote sensing imagery is a fundamental task in
computer vision, supporting a wide range of applications such as land use
classification, urban planning, and environmental monitoring. However, this
task is often challenged by the high spatial resolution, complex scene
structures, and diverse object scales present in remote sensing data. To
address these challenges, various deep learning architectures have been
proposed, including convolutional neural networks, Vision Transformers, and the
recently introduced Vision Mamba. Vision Mamba features a global receptive
field and low computational complexity, demonstrating both efficiency and
effectiveness in image segmentation. However, its reliance on global scanning
tends to overlook critical local features, such as textures and edges, which
are essential for achieving accurate segmentation in remote sensing contexts.
To tackle this limitation, we propose SwinMamba, a novel framework inspired by
the Swin Transformer. SwinMamba integrates localized Mamba-style scanning
within shifted windows with a global receptive field, to enhance the model's
perception of both local and global features. Specifically, the first two
stages of SwinMamba perform local scanning to capture fine-grained details,
while its subsequent two stages leverage global scanning to fuse broader
contextual information. In our model, the use of overlapping shifted windows
enhances inter-region information exchange, facilitating more robust feature
integration across the entire image. Extensive experiments on the LoveDA and
ISPRS Potsdam datasets demonstrate that SwinMamba outperforms state-of-the-art
methods, underscoring its effectiveness and potential as a superior solution
for semantic segmentation of remotely sensed imagery.

*Wenhao Tang,Heng Fang,Ge Wu,Xiang Li,Ming-Ming Cheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一个基于打包的多实例学习框架，通过将可变长度的特征序列打包成固定长度来解决计算病理学中全切片图像序列长度极端变化的问题，同时引入残差分支和注意力驱动的下采样器来提高训练效率和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 计算病理学中的全切片图像具有极长的序列长度（高达20万）、显著的序列长度变化（从200到20万）以及有限的监督信息，这些极端变化导致数据高度异质性和冗余，传统方法在有限监督下难以有效处理这些问题。

Method: 提出pack-based MIL框架，将采样的可变长度特征序列打包成固定长度序列以支持批量训练；引入残差分支将多个切片中丢弃的特征组合成超切片进行训练；使用注意力驱动的下采样器压缩特征以减少冗余。

Result: 在PANDA(UNI)数据集上，该方法实现了高达8%的准确率提升，同时仅使用12%的训练时间，显著提高了训练效率和性能。

Conclusion: 专注于解决计算病理学中的数据挑战在基础模型时代具有巨大潜力，所提出的方法有效解决了序列长度极端变化、数据异质性和冗余等关键问题。

Abstract: Computational pathology (CPath) digitizes pathology slides into whole slide
images (WSIs), enabling analysis for critical healthcare tasks such as cancer
diagnosis and prognosis. However, WSIs possess extremely long sequence lengths
(up to 200K), significant length variations (from 200 to 200K), and limited
supervision. These extreme variations in sequence length lead to high data
heterogeneity and redundancy. Conventional methods often compromise on training
efficiency and optimization to preserve such heterogeneity under limited
supervision. To comprehensively address these challenges, we propose a
pack-based MIL framework. It packs multiple sampled, variable-length feature
sequences into fixed-length ones, enabling batched training while preserving
data heterogeneity. Moreover, we introduce a residual branch that composes
discarded features from multiple slides into a hyperslide which is trained with
tailored labels. It offers multi-slide supervision while mitigating feature
loss from sampling. Meanwhile, an attention-driven downsampler is introduced to
compress features in both branches to reduce redundancy. By alleviating these
challenges, our approach achieves an accuracy improvement of up to 8% while
using only 12% of the training time in the PANDA(UNI). Extensive experiments
demonstrate that focusing data challenges in CPath holds significant potential
in the era of foundation models. The code is

TL;DR: SimDiff是一个模拟器约束的扩散模型，通过将环境参数直接集成到去噪过程中，无需在推理时重复调用模拟器即可高效生成物理上合理的人类运动。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常将基于模拟器的运动投影层整合到扩散过程中以确保物理合理性，但由于模拟器的顺序性质，这些方法计算成本高且无法并行化。

Method: 将模拟器运动投影解释为扩散过程中的一种引导形式，提出SimDiff模型，通过将环境参数（如重力、风力）直接条件化到去噪过程中，避免推理时的重复模拟器调用。

Result: SimDiff能够高效生成物理上合理的运动，提供对不同物理系数的细粒度控制，并在未见过的环境参数组合上展现出组合泛化能力。

Conclusion: SimDiff通过将物理约束直接集成到扩散模型中，实现了高效且可控的物理合理运动生成，解决了传统模拟器方法的计算效率问题。

Abstract: Generating physically plausible human motion is crucial for applications such
as character animation and virtual reality. Existing approaches often
incorporate a simulator-based motion projection layer to the diffusion process
to enforce physical plausibility. However, such methods are computationally
expensive due to the sequential nature of the simulator, which prevents
parallelization. We show that simulator-based motion projection can be
interpreted as a form of guidance, either classifier-based or classifier-free,
within the diffusion process. Building on this insight, we propose SimDiff, a
Simulator-constrained Diffusion Model that integrates environment parameters
(e.g., gravity, wind) directly into the denoising process. By conditioning on
these parameters, SimDiff generates physically plausible motions efficiently,
without repeated simulator calls at inference, and also provides fine-grained
control over different physical coefficients. Moreover, SimDiff successfully
generalizes to unseen combinations of environmental parameters, demonstrating
compositional generalization.

TL;DR: 本文研究了视觉架构对高斯噪声的鲁棒性，通过评估1174个预训练模型识别出四个关键设计模式，并提供了理论解释和实用设计指南。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然视觉模型的鲁棒性经常被测量，但特定架构设计选择对其的影响很少被剖析。本文旨在理解为什么某些视觉架构对高斯噪声具有内在更强的鲁棒性。

Method: 对1174个预训练视觉模型进行广泛评估，识别出四个一致的设计模式：更大的stem核、更小的输入分辨率、平均池化以及监督ViT而非CLIP ViT。然后通过理论分析解释这些发现。

Result: 识别出的设计模式可带来高达506位的排名提升和21.6%的准确率增益。理论分析证明了低通stem核的噪声衰减效果、平均池化的无偏噪声抑制特性，以及CLIP ViT的脆弱性源于其预处理中的较小归一化标准差。

Conclusion: 研究结果将鲁棒性分解为可解释的模块，提供了理论解释，并建立了实用的即插即用指南，用于设计对高斯噪声更鲁棒的视觉模型。

Abstract: While the robustness of vision models is often measured, their dependence on
specific architectural design choices is rarely dissected. We investigate why
certain vision architectures are inherently more robust to additive Gaussian
noise and convert these empirical insights into simple, actionable design
rules. Specifically, we performed extensive evaluations on 1,174 pretrained
vision models, empirically identifying four consistent design patterns for
improved robustness against Gaussian noise: larger stem kernels, smaller input
resolutions, average pooling, and supervised vision transformers (ViTs) rather
than CLIP ViTs, which yield up to 506 rank improvements and 21.6\%p accuracy
gains. We then develop a theoretical analysis that explains these findings,
converting observed correlations into causal mechanisms. First, we prove that
low-pass stem kernels attenuate noise with a gain that decreases quadratically
with kernel size and that anti-aliased downsampling reduces noise energy
roughly in proportion to the square of the downsampling factor. Second, we
demonstrate that average pooling is unbiased and suppresses noise in proportion
to the pooling window area, whereas max pooling incurs a positive bias that
grows slowly with window size and yields a relatively higher mean-squared error
and greater worst-case sensitivity. Third, we reveal and explain the
vulnerability of CLIP ViTs via a pixel-space Lipschitz bound: The smaller
normalization standard deviations used in CLIP preprocessing amplify worst-case
sensitivity by up to 1.91 times relative to the Inception-style preprocessing
common in supervised ViTs. Our results collectively disentangle robustness into
interpretable modules, provide a theory that explains the observed trends, and
build practical, plug-and-play guidelines for designing vision models more
robust against Gaussian noise.

Abstract: Scene graphs (SGs) provide structured relational representations crucial for
decoding complex, dynamic surgical environments. This PRISMA-ScR-guided scoping
review systematically maps the evolving landscape of SG research in surgery,
charting its applications, methodological advancements, and future directions.
Our analysis reveals rapid growth, yet uncovers a critical 'data divide':
internal-view research (e.g., triplet recognition) almost exclusively uses
real-world 2D video, while external-view 4D modeling relies heavily on
simulated data, exposing a key translational research gap. Methodologically,
the field has advanced from foundational graph neural networks to specialized
foundation models that now significantly outperform generalist large
vision-language models in surgical contexts. This progress has established SGs
as a cornerstone technology for both analysis, such as workflow recognition and
automated safety monitoring, and generative tasks like controllable surgical
simulation. Although challenges in data annotation and real-time implementation
persist, they are actively being addressed through emerging techniques.
Surgical SGs are maturing into an essential semantic bridge, enabling a new

Abstract: We present an automated vision-based system for defect detection and
classification of laser power meter sensor coatings. Our approach addresses the
critical challenge of identifying coating defects such as thermal damage and
scratches that can compromise laser energy measurement accuracy in medical and
industrial applications. The system employs an unsupervised anomaly detection
framework that trains exclusively on ``good'' sensor images to learn normal
coating distribution patterns, enabling detection of both known and novel
defect types without requiring extensive labeled defect datasets. Our
methodology consists of three key components: (1) a robust preprocessing
pipeline using Laplacian edge detection and K-means clustering to segment the
area of interest, (2) synthetic data augmentation via StyleGAN2, and (3) a
UFlow-based neural network architecture for multi-scale feature extraction and
anomaly map generation. Experimental evaluation on 366 real sensor images
demonstrates $93.8\%$ accuracy on defective samples and $89.3\%$ accuracy on

Abstract: The dynamic propagation of social media has broadened the reach of financial
advisory content through podcast videos, yet extracting insights from lengthy,
multimodal segments (30-40 minutes) remains challenging. We introduce FASTER
(Financial Advisory Summariser with Textual Embedded Relevant images), a
modular framework that tackles three key challenges: (1) extracting
modality-specific features, (2) producing optimized, concise summaries, and (3)
aligning visual keyframes with associated textual points. FASTER employs BLIP
for semantic visual descriptions, OCR for textual patterns, and Whisper-based
transcription with Speaker diarization as BOS features. A modified Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO)-based loss function, equipped with BOS-specific
fact-checking, ensures precision, relevance, and factual consistency against
the human-aligned summary. A ranker-based retrieval mechanism further aligns
keyframes with summarized content, enhancing interpretability and cross-modal
coherence. To acknowledge data resource scarcity, we introduce Fin-APT, a
dataset comprising 470 publicly accessible financial advisory pep-talk videos
for robust multimodal research. Comprehensive cross-domain experiments confirm
FASTER's strong performance, robustness, and generalizability when compared to
Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs). By establishing
a new standard for multimodal summarization, FASTER makes financial advisory
content more accessible and actionable, thereby opening new avenues for
research. The dataset and code are available at:

TL;DR: ASD是一种适配器，能够在无需预训练、聚类学习或训练好的聚类模型等先决条件的情况下，实现自监督学习（SSL）学习器的冷启动，用于深度图像聚类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的将SSL技术集成到深度聚类框架中的方法都需要预训练、聚类学习或训练好的聚类模型作为先决条件，这限制了SSL学习器在图像聚类任务中的灵活性和即插即用应用。

Method: 1. 从所有未标记数据中随机采样伪标记数据，并设置实例级分类器来学习语义对齐的实例级标签；2. 利用实例级分类能力，跟踪未标记数据预测的类别转换，提取实例级类别的高级相似性；3. 利用这些相似性为伪标记数据分配聚类级标签；4. 使用带有聚类级标签的伪标记数据触发在未标记数据上训练的通用SSL学习器进行图像聚类。

Result: ASD在各种基准测试中表现出优于最新深度图像聚类方法的性能，与使用真实标签的SSL方法相比，准确率差距非常小（例如在CIFAR-10上仅为1.33%）。此外，ASD还能进一步提升现有SSL嵌入深度图像聚类方法的性能。

Conclusion: ASD提供了一种无需先决条件的有效方法，将SSL学习器应用于深度图像聚类任务，展示了优异的性能和通用性。

Abstract: Recently, some works integrate SSL techniques into deep clustering frameworks
to enhance image clustering performance. However, they all need pretraining,
clustering learning, or a trained clustering model as prerequisites, limiting
the flexible and out-of-box application of SSL learners in the image clustering
task. This work introduces ASD, an adaptor that enables the cold-start of SSL
learners for deep image clustering without any prerequisites. Specifically, we
first randomly sample pseudo-labeled data from all unlabeled data, and set an
instance-level classifier to learn them with semantically aligned
instance-level labels. With the ability of instance-level classification, we
track the class transitions of predictions on unlabeled data to extract
high-level similarities of instance-level classes, which can be utilized to
assign cluster-level labels to pseudo-labeled data. Finally, we use the
pseudo-labeled data with assigned cluster-level labels to trigger a general SSL
learner trained on the unlabeled data for image clustering. We show the
superior performance of ASD across various benchmarks against the latest deep
image clustering approaches and very slight accuracy gaps compared to SSL
methods using ground-truth, e.g., only 1.33% on CIFAR-10. Moreover, ASD can
also further boost the performance of existing SSL-embedded deep image
clustering methods.

TL;DR: SiNGER是一种新的知识蒸馏框架，通过奇异零空间引导的能量重分配来抑制Vision Transformers中的高范数伪影，同时保留信息信号，提升学生模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision Transformers作为视觉基础模型的骨干会产生高范数伪影，这些伪影在知识蒸馏过程中会主导目标函数，导致学生模型过度拟合伪影而忽视信息信号，削弱了大模型的增益。

Method: 提出奇异零空间引导的能量重分配(SiNGER)框架，通过零空间引导的扰动在教师特征精炼过程中抑制伪影同时保留信息，使用基于LoRA的适配器实现高效扰动，最小化结构修改。

Result: 大量实验表明，SiNGER能持续提升学生模型性能，在多个下游任务中达到最先进水平，并产生更清晰、更可解释的表征。

Conclusion: SiNGER框架有效解决了教师特征中伪影抑制和信息保留之间的权衡问题，为知识蒸馏提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: Vision Transformers are widely adopted as the backbone of vision foundation
models, but they are known to produce high-norm artifacts that degrade
representation quality. When knowledge distillation transfers these features to
students, high-norm artifacts dominate the objective, so students overfit to
artifacts and underweight informative signals, diminishing the gains from
larger models. Prior work attempted to remove artifacts but encountered an
inherent trade-off between artifact suppression and preserving informative
signals from teachers. To address this, we introduce Singular Nullspace-Guided
Energy Reallocation (SiNGER), a novel distillation framework that suppresses
artifacts while preserving informative signals. The key idea is principled
teacher feature refinement: during refinement, we leverage the nullspace-guided
perturbation to preserve information while suppressing artifacts. Then, the
refined teacher's features are distilled to a student. We implement this
perturbation efficiently with a LoRA-based adapter that requires minimal
structural modification. Extensive experiments show that \oursname consistently
improves student models, achieving state-of-the-art performance in multiple
downstream tasks and producing clearer and more interpretable representations.

Conclusion: Fast-SEnSeI为多光谱传感器提供了灵活、高效的云分割解决方案，适用于星载硬件平台。

Abstract: Cloud segmentation is a critical preprocessing step for many Earth
observation tasks, yet most models are tightly coupled to specific sensor
configurations and rely on ground-based processing. In this work, we propose
Fast-SEnSeI, a lightweight, sensor-independent encoder module that enables
flexible, on-board cloud segmentation across multispectral sensors with varying
band configurations. Building upon SEnSeI-v2, Fast-SEnSeI integrates an
improved spectral descriptor, lightweight architecture, and robust padding-band
handling. It accepts arbitrary combinations of spectral bands and their
wavelengths, producing fixed-size feature maps that feed into a compact,
quantized segmentation model based on a modified U-Net. The module runs
efficiently on embedded CPUs using Apache TVM, while the segmentation model is
deployed on FPGA, forming a CPU-FPGA hybrid pipeline suitable for
space-qualified hardware. Evaluations on Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 datasets
demonstrate accurate segmentation across diverse input configurations.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于单神经元的概念擦除方法（SNCE），通过操纵单个神经元来精确防止有害内容生成，同时最小化对图像质量的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文本到图像模型虽然具有强大的图像生成能力，但也存在生成有害内容的安全风险。现有概念擦除方法的关键挑战是在精确移除目标概念的同时最小化图像质量的退化。

Method: 训练稀疏自编码器（SAE）将文本嵌入映射到稀疏解耦的潜在空间，其中单个神经元与原子语义概念紧密对齐。设计基于调制频率评分的新神经元识别方法，通过抑制有害概念特定神经元的激活来实现精确的概念擦除。

Conclusion: SNCE方法通过单神经元操作实现了精确的概念擦除，在保持图像质量的同时有效防止有害内容生成，为解决文本到图像模型的安全问题提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Text-to-image models exhibit remarkable capabilities in image generation.
However, they also pose safety risks of generating harmful content. A key
challenge of existing concept erasure methods is the precise removal of target
concepts while minimizing degradation of image quality. In this paper, we
propose Single Neuron-based Concept Erasure (SNCE), a novel approach that can
precisely prevent harmful content generation by manipulating only a single
neuron. Specifically, we train a Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) to map text
embeddings into a sparse, disentangled latent space, where individual neurons
align tightly with atomic semantic concepts. To accurately locate neurons
responsible for harmful concepts, we design a novel neuron identification
method based on the modulated frequency scoring of activation patterns. By
suppressing activations of the harmful concept-specific neuron, SNCE achieves
surgical precision in concept erasure with minimal disruption to image quality.
Experiments on various benchmarks demonstrate that SNCE achieves
state-of-the-art results in target concept erasure, while preserving the
model's generation capabilities for non-target concepts. Additionally, our
method exhibits strong robustness against adversarial attacks, significantly
outperforming existing methods.

TL;DR: 提出KDSS算法用于植物器官点云分割，该算法不依赖特定传感器和植物物种，能够保持全分辨率点云分割，避免传统下采样方法的信息损失。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有植物点云分割方法通常针对特定植物物种或传感器，且需要大量预处理和下采样来满足硬件或神经网络输入要求，这会导致信息损失。

Method: 提出KDSS（K-Dimensional Sub-Sampling）算法，这是一种轻量级的子采样方法，能够保持点云分辨率，适用于不同传感器数据（摄影测量、激光三角测量、LiDAR）和各种植物物种。

Result: 将KDSS与当前最先进的分割模型结合，在不同传感器模态和植物物种上均获得满意结果。

Conclusion: KDSS可作为传统密集预处理和下采样方法的轻量级替代方案，适用于任意植物物种和传感器模态的器官分割。

Abstract: Accurate point cloud segmentation for plant organs is crucial for 3D plant
phenotyping. Existing solutions are designed problem-specific with a focus on
certain plant species or specified sensor-modalities for data acquisition.
Furthermore, it is common to use extensive pre-processing and down-sample the
plant point clouds to meet hardware or neural network input size requirements.
We propose a simple, yet effective algorithm KDSS for sub-sampling of
biological point clouds that is agnostic to sensor data and plant species. The
main benefit of this approach is that we do not need to down-sample our input
data and thus, enable segmentation of the full-resolution point cloud.
Combining KD-SS with current state-of-the-art segmentation models shows
satisfying results evaluated on different modalities such as photogrammetry,
laser triangulation and LiDAR for various plant species. We propose KD-SS as
lightweight resolution-retaining alternative to intensive pre-processing and
down-sampling methods for plant organ segmentation regardless of used species
and sensor modality.

TL;DR: Mambo是一个新的前景-背景分解框架，用于解决少样本分布外检测中现有方法对局部类别相似性过度依赖和固定背景补丁提取策略的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的FG-BG分解方法在FS-OOD检测中由于过度依赖局部类别相似性和固定的背景补丁提取策略而鲁棒性较低。

Method: 提出学习背景提示来获取包含背景和图像语义信息的局部背景相似性，然后使用局部类别相似性来细化局部背景相似性。同时提出补丁自校准调优来灵活选择不同样本的背景补丁数量。

Result: 在真实世界数据集上的广泛实验表明，Mambo在OOD检测和近OOD检测设置方面相比SOTA方法取得了最佳性能。

Conclusion: Mambo通过结合细化的局部背景相似性和局部类别相似性进行背景提取，减少了先前方法对局部类别相似性的依赖，并通过灵活的补丁选择策略解决了固定背景提取的问题。

Abstract: Existing foreground-background (FG-BG) decomposition methods for the few-shot
out-of-distribution (FS-OOD) detection often suffer from low robustness due to
over-reliance on the local class similarity and a fixed background patch
extraction strategy. To address these challenges, we propose a new FG-BG
decomposition framework, namely Mambo, for FS-OOD detection. Specifically, we
propose to first learn a background prompt to obtain the local background
similarity containing both the background and image semantic information, and
then refine the local background similarity using the local class similarity.
As a result, we use both the refined local background similarity and the local
class similarity to conduct background extraction, reducing the dependence of
the local class similarity in previous methods. Furthermore, we propose the
patch self-calibrated tuning to consider the sample diversity to flexibly
select numbers of background patches for different samples, and thus exploring
the issue of fixed background extraction strategies in previous methods.
Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed
Mambo achieves the best performance, compared to SOTA methods in terms of OOD
detection and near OOD detection setting. The source code will be released at

TL;DR: 本文提出了两种用于图像分割任务的数据集划分方法：IPS和WDES，旨在解决随机划分导致的测试集不具代表性和模型评估偏差问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图像分割中随机划分数据集会导致测试集不具代表性，造成评估偏差和模型泛化能力差。虽然分层采样在分类任务中有效，但分割任务的多标签结构和类别不平衡使其难以应用。

Method: 提出了迭代像素分层（IPS）和基于Wasserstein距离的进化分层（WDES）两种方法。WDES使用遗传算法最小化Wasserstein距离，优化跨数据集划分的标签分布相似性。

Result: WDES始终产生更具代表性的划分，在街景、医学影像和卫星图像等多种分割任务中表现出更低的性能方差和更好的模型评估效果，特别适用于小型、不平衡和低多样性数据集。

Conclusion: WDES方法在解决分割任务数据集划分偏差方面表现出色，特别是在处理具有挑战性的数据集时效果显著，证明了其在优化模型评估和泛化能力方面的价值。

Abstract: Random splitting of datasets in image segmentation often leads to
unrepresentative test sets, resulting in biased evaluations and poor model
generalization. While stratified sampling has proven effective for addressing
label distribution imbalance in classification tasks, extending these ideas to
segmentation remains challenging due to the multi-label structure and class
imbalance typically present in such data. Building on existing stratification
concepts, we introduce Iterative Pixel Stratification (IPS), a straightforward,
label-aware sampling method tailored for segmentation tasks. Additionally, we
present Wasserstein-Driven Evolutionary Stratification (WDES), a novel genetic
algorithm designed to minimize the Wasserstein distance, thereby optimizing the
similarity of label distributions across dataset splits. We prove that WDES is
globally optimal given enough generations. Using newly proposed statistical
heterogeneity metrics, we evaluate both methods against random sampling and
find that WDES consistently produces more representative splits. Applying WDES
across diverse segmentation tasks, including street scenes, medical imaging,
and satellite imagery, leads to lower performance variance and improved model
evaluation. Our results also highlight the particular value of WDES in handling
small, imbalanced, and low-diversity datasets, where conventional splitting
strategies are most prone to bias.

<details>

Motivation: 现有的细粒度分类模型依赖部件标注或自动裁剪方法，但这些方法存在局部特征表示不完整的问题。人类识别物体时还会形成语义关联，因此本文提出利用层次化语义关联作为监督信号。

Method: 提出EnGraf-Net模型，将语义层次结构（分类学）作为监督信号集成到端到端深度神经网络中，无需裁剪技术或手动标注。

Result: 在CIFAR-100、CUB-200-2011和FGVC-Aircraft三个数据集上的实验表明，EnGraf-Net优于许多现有细粒度模型，与最先进的模型性能相当。

Conclusion: 利用语义层次结构作为监督信号可以有效提升细粒度分类性能，无需依赖复杂的裁剪技术或手动标注。

Abstract: Fine-grained classification models are designed to focus on the relevant
details necessary to distinguish highly similar classes, particularly when
intra-class variance is high and inter-class variance is low. Most existing
models rely on part annotations such as bounding boxes, part locations, or
textual attributes to enhance classification performance, while others employ
sophisticated techniques to automatically extract attention maps. We posit that
part-based approaches, including automatic cropping methods, suffer from an
incomplete representation of local features, which are fundamental for
distinguishing similar objects. While fine-grained classification aims to
recognize the leaves of a hierarchical structure, humans recognize objects by
also forming semantic associations. In this paper, we leverage semantic
associations structured as a hierarchy (taxonomy) as supervised signals within
an end-to-end deep neural network model, termed EnGraf-Net. Extensive
experiments on three well-known datasets CIFAR-100, CUB-200-2011, and
FGVC-Aircraft demonstrate the superiority of EnGraf-Net over many existing
fine-grained models, showing competitive performance with the most recent
state-of-the-art approaches, without requiring cropping techniques or manual
annotations.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了对抗性补丁在Vision Transformers（ViTs）上的可迁移性，发现ViTs虽然比CNNs更鲁棒，但仍然容易受到对抗性补丁攻击，攻击成功率在不同ViT模型间差异显著（40.04%-99.97%）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着机器学习系统应用的增加，其安全性变得至关重要。ViTs虽然在性能和对抗性扰动鲁棒性上优于CNNs，但仍存在被对抗性补丁攻击的漏洞，需要研究这种攻击在不同架构间的可迁移性。

Method: 使用Creases Transformation（CT）技术设计逼真的对抗性补丁，在四种微调的ViT模型上进行二元人物分类任务测试，评估从CNNs到ViTs的对抗性攻击技术可迁移性。

Result: 实验结果显示ViT模型对对抗性补丁攻击存在显著差异：google/vit-base-patch16-224-in21k攻击成功率为40.04%，facebook/dino-vitb16达到99.97%，其他两个模型分别为66.40%和65.17%。

Conclusion: 对抗性补丁可以从CNNs成功迁移到ViTs，预训练数据集规模和方法论强烈影响模型对对抗性攻击的鲁棒性，ViTs的安全性仍需进一步研究。

Abstract: The increasing reliance on machine learning systems has made their security a
critical concern. Evasion attacks enable adversaries to manipulate the
decision-making processes of AI systems, potentially causing security breaches
or misclassification of targets. Vision Transformers (ViTs) have gained
significant traction in modern machine learning due to increased 1) performance
compared to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and 2) robustness against
adversarial perturbations. However, ViTs remain vulnerable to evasion attacks,
particularly to adversarial patches, unique patterns designed to manipulate AI
classification systems. These vulnerabilities are investigated by designing
realistic adversarial patches to cause misclassification in person vs.
non-person classification tasks using the Creases Transformation (CT)
technique, which adds subtle geometric distortions similar to those occurring
naturally when wearing clothing. This study investigates the transferability of
adversarial attack techniques used in CNNs when applied to ViT classification
models. Experimental evaluation across four fine-tuned ViT models on a binary
person classification task reveals significant vulnerability variations: attack
success rates ranged from 40.04% (google/vit-base-patch16-224-in21k) to 99.97%
(facebook/dino-vitb16), with google/vit-base-patch16-224 achieving 66.40% and
facebook/dinov3-vitb16 reaching 65.17%. These results confirm the
cross-architectural transferability of adversarial patches from CNNs to ViTs,
with pre-training dataset scale and methodology strongly influencing model
resilience to adversarial attacks.

TL;DR: UniTransfer是一个新颖的视频概念迁移架构，通过空间和时间步分解实现精确可控的视频概念迁移，包括前景主体、背景和运动流的三重分解，以及基于Chain-of-Prompt的渐进式去噪过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频概念迁移方法缺乏对视频不同组件的细粒度控制能力，难以实现精确可控的编辑效果。需要一种能够分解视频空间和时间维度的方法来提升迁移质量和可控性。

Method: 1）空间分解：将视频解耦为前景主体、背景和运动流三个关键组件；2）双流到单流的DiT架构支持细粒度控制；3）基于随机掩码的自监督预训练策略；4）Chain-of-Prompt机制实现时间步分解，将去噪过程分为三个不同粒度的阶段。

Result: 在OpenAnimal动物视频数据集上的大量实验表明，该方法在视觉保真度和可编辑性方面均优于现有基线方法，能够实现高质量和可控的视频概念迁移。

Conclusion: UniTransfer通过空间和时间维度的双重分解机制，为视频概念迁移提供了新的解决方案，在保持高质量生成的同时实现了更好的可控性，为视频编辑领域带来了重要进展。

Abstract: We propose a novel architecture UniTransfer, which introduces both spatial
and diffusion timestep decomposition in a progressive paradigm, achieving
precise and controllable video concept transfer. Specifically, in terms of
spatial decomposition, we decouple videos into three key components: the
foreground subject, the background, and the motion flow. Building upon this
decomposed formulation, we further introduce a dual-to-single-stream DiT-based
architecture for supporting fine-grained control over different components in
the videos. We also introduce a self-supervised pretraining strategy based on
random masking to enhance the decomposed representation learning from
large-scale unlabeled video data. Inspired by the Chain-of-Thought reasoning
paradigm, we further revisit the denoising diffusion process and propose a
Chain-of-Prompt (CoP) mechanism to achieve the timestep decomposition. We
decompose the denoising process into three stages of different granularity and
leverage large language models (LLMs) for stage-specific instructions to guide
the generation progressively. We also curate an animal-centric video dataset
called OpenAnimal to facilitate the advancement and benchmarking of research in
video concept transfer. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method
achieves high-quality and controllable video concept transfer across diverse
reference images and scenes, surpassing existing baselines in both visual
fidelity and editability. Web Page:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态大语言模型主要依赖静态感知阶段，限制了推理能力的发展。需要一种能够像人类一样在推理过程中进行迭代感知的方法来提升模型的感知和理解能力。

Conclusion: VTTS通过增加感知计算有效提升了多模态大语言模型的性能，验证了迭代感知在推理过程中的重要性，为达到人类水平的感知和理解能力提供了有效途径。

Abstract: Inducing reasoning in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) is critical
for achieving human-level perception and understanding. Existing methods mainly
leverage LLM reasoning to analyze parsed visuals, often limited by static
perception stages. This paper introduces Visual Test-Time Scaling (VTTS), a
novel approach to enhance MLLMs' reasoning via iterative perception during
inference. VTTS mimics humans' hierarchical attention by progressively refining
focus on high-confidence spatio-temporal regions, guided by updated textual
predictions. Specifically, VTTS employs an Iterative Perception (ITP)
mechanism, incorporating reinforcement learning with spatio-temporal
supervision to optimize reasoning. To support this paradigm, we also present
VTTS-80K, a dataset tailored for iterative perception. These designs allows a
MLLM to enhance its performance by increasing its perceptual compute. Extensive
experiments validate VTTS's effectiveness and generalization across diverse
tasks and benchmarks. Our newly introduced Videochat-R1.5 model has achieved
remarkable improvements, with an average increase of over 5\%, compared to
robust baselines such as Qwen2.5VL-3B and -7B, across more than 15 benchmarks
that encompass video conversation, video reasoning, and spatio-temporal

Motivation: 理解深度学习模型学习的内容对于临床AI安全部署至关重要，现有研究主要关注基于像素的解释方法，而对反映临床医生推理过程的文本概念关注较少。

Method: 利用乳腺X光片特定的视觉语言模型（Mammo-CLIP）作为"解剖器"，在指定层用人类可解释的文本概念标记神经元，并量化其与领域知识的对齐度。

Result: 在乳腺X光片数据上训练的模型捕获更多临床相关概念且更符合放射科医生工作流程；针对特定任务的微调增强了某些概念类别（如良性钙化）的捕获，但减少了其他类别（如密度相关特征）的覆盖。

Conclusion: Mammo-CLIP Dissect提供了卷积神经网络如何捕获乳腺X光片特定知识的见解，揭示了领域特定训练和任务特定适应如何塑造概念学习。

Abstract: Understanding what deep learning (DL) models learn is essential for the safe
deployment of artificial intelligence (AI) in clinical settings. While previous
work has focused on pixel-based explainability methods, less attention has been
paid to the textual concepts learned by these models, which may better reflect
the reasoning used by clinicians. We introduce Mammo-CLIP Dissect, the first
concept-based explainability framework for systematically dissecting DL vision
models trained for mammography. Leveraging a mammography-specific
vision-language model (Mammo-CLIP) as a "dissector," our approach labels
neurons at specified layers with human-interpretable textual concepts and
quantifies their alignment to domain knowledge. Using Mammo-CLIP Dissect, we
investigate three key questions: (1) how concept learning differs between DL
vision models trained on general image datasets versus mammography-specific
datasets; (2) how fine-tuning for downstream mammography tasks affects concept
specialisation; and (3) which mammography-relevant concepts remain
underrepresented. We show that models trained on mammography data capture more
clinically relevant concepts and align more closely with radiologists'
workflows than models not trained on mammography data. Fine-tuning for
task-specific classification enhances the capture of certain concept categories
(e.g., benign calcifications) but can reduce coverage of others (e.g.,
density-related features), indicating a trade-off between specialisation and
generalisation. Our findings show that Mammo-CLIP Dissect provides insights
into how convolutional neural networks (CNNs) capture mammography-specific
knowledge. By comparing models across training data and fine-tuning regimes, we
reveal how domain-specific training and task-specific adaptation shape concept
learning. Code and concept set are available:

TL;DR: MOSS-ChatV是一个基于强化学习的视频推理框架，通过动态时间规整（DTW）的过程奖励来解决多模态大语言模型在视频推理中的过程不一致性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态大语言模型在视频推理中存在过程不一致问题，即中间推理过程与视频动态偏离，即使最终答案正确，也影响了模型的可解释性和鲁棒性。

Method: 提出MOSS-ChatV框架，采用基于动态时间规整（DTW）的规则化过程奖励，使推理轨迹与时间基础参考对齐，无需辅助奖励模型即可实现高效的过程监督。

Result: MOSS-ChatV在MOSS-Video测试集上达到87.2%的准确率，在MVBench和MMVU等通用视频基准测试上也有性能提升，并在Qwen2.5-VL和Phi-2等不同架构上均获得一致增益。

Conclusion: 该框架具有广泛适用性，GPT-4o评估显示MOSS-ChatV能产生更一致和稳定的推理轨迹，有效解决了视频推理中的过程不一致问题。

Abstract: Video reasoning has emerged as a critical capability for multimodal large
language models (MLLMs), requiring models to move beyond static perception
toward coherent understanding of temporal dynamics in complex scenes. Yet
existing MLLMs often exhibit process inconsistency, where intermediate
reasoning drifts from video dynamics even when the final answer is correct,
undermining interpretability and robustness. To address this issue, we
introduce MOSS-ChatV, a reinforcement learning framework with a Dynamic Time
Warping (DTW)-based process reward. This rule-based reward aligns reasoning
traces with temporally grounded references, enabling efficient process
supervision without auxiliary reward models. We further identify dynamic state
prediction as a key measure of video reasoning and construct MOSS-Video, a
benchmark with annotated reasoning traces, where the training split is used to
fine-tune MOSS-ChatV and the held-out split is reserved for evaluation.
MOSS-ChatV achieves 87.2\% on MOSS-Video (test) and improves performance on
general video benchmarks such as MVBench and MMVU. The framework consistently
yields gains across different architectures, including Qwen2.5-VL and Phi-2,
confirming its broad applicability. Evaluations with GPT-4o-as-judge further
show that MOSS-ChatV produces more consistent and stable reasoning traces.

Motivation: 现有方法通常分别学习相机和物体运动，这可能导致对相机与物体之间相对运动的混淆。为了解决这一挑战，需要一种能够整合两种运动的方法。

Method: 利用稳定扩散网络学习参考运动映射，结合提取的语义物体先验，通过图像到视频网络生成能够准确遵循指定相机轨迹并保持物体运动一致性的视频。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法通过将相机和物体运动整合为像素运动，有效解决了视频生成中相机轨迹引导的挑战，实现了更好的运动一致性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Generating videos guided by camera trajectories poses significant challenges
in achieving consistency and generalizability, particularly when both camera
and object motions are present. Existing approaches often attempt to learn
these motions separately, which may lead to confusion regarding the relative
motion between the camera and the objects. To address this challenge, we
propose a novel approach that integrates both camera and object motions by
converting them into the motion of corresponding pixels. Utilizing a stable
diffusion network, we effectively learn reference motion maps in relation to
the specified camera trajectory. These maps, along with an extracted semantic
object prior, are then fed into an image-to-video network to generate the
desired video that can accurately follow the designated camera trajectory while
maintaining consistent object motions. Extensive experiments verify that our
model outperforms SOTA methods by a large margin.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文研究了图像生成AI中判别器最不利的条件，分析了数据维度和复杂度两个关键因素，发现中等复杂度的数据集最有利于检测合成图像。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着图像生成AI的快速发展，合成图像与真实图像的界限变得模糊，引发了生成器与判别器之间的竞争。本文旨在探索判别器在何种条件下处于最不利地位。

Method: 使用Kolmogorov复杂度作为数据集内在结构的度量，分析数据维度和复杂度对判别器检测能力的影响。

Result: 研究发现：非常简单的数据集和高度复杂的数据集都会降低合成图像的可检测性；而中等复杂度的数据集为检测创造了最有利条件，因为生成器无法完全捕捉分布且错误仍然可见。

Conclusion: 数据复杂度对合成图像检测有重要影响，中等复杂度数据集最有利于判别器识别生成器的缺陷。

Abstract: The rapid progress of image generative AI has blurred the boundary between
synthetic and real images, fueling an arms race between generators and
discriminators. This paper investigates the conditions under which
discriminators are most disadvantaged in this competition. We analyze two key
factors: data dimensionality and data complexity. While increased
dimensionality often strengthens the discriminators ability to detect subtle
inconsistencies, complexity introduces a more nuanced effect. Using Kolmogorov
complexity as a measure of intrinsic dataset structure, we show that both very
simple and highly complex datasets reduce the detectability of synthetic
images; generators can learn simple datasets almost perfectly, whereas extreme
diversity masks imperfections. In contrast, intermediate-complexity datasets
create the most favorable conditions for detection, as generators fail to fully
capture the distribution and their errors remain visible.

*Aymen Bouguerra,Daniel Montoya,Alexandra Gomez-Villa,Fabio Arnez,Chokri Mraidha*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文对CLIP模型的量化进行了大规模评估，发现量化不仅能提高效率，还能改善模型可靠性指标，挑战了传统的效率-性能权衡观点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然视觉语言模型如CLIP在零样本泛化方面表现出色，但量化对CLIP性能的影响尚未得到充分探索，特别是在准确性之外的可信度指标方面。

Method: 通过大规模评估量化对CLIP模型的影响，不仅评估分布内准确性，还评估了包括校准度和OOD检测在内的综合可靠性指标。

Result: 量化持续改善了通常欠自信的预训练模型的校准度，但对过度自信的模型则可能降低校准度。有趣的是，即使校准度下降，OOD检测性能仍可能提升。某些量化感知训练方法能同时提升零样本准确性、校准度和OOD鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 量化可以超越其传统角色，为部署高效、可靠和鲁棒的视觉语言模型提供新的可能性，挑战了严格的效率-性能权衡观念。

Abstract: The powerful zero-shot generalization capabilities of vision-language models
(VLMs) like CLIP have enabled new paradigms for safety-related tasks such as
out-of-distribution (OOD) detection. However, additional aspects crucial for
the computationally efficient and reliable deployment of CLIP are still
overlooked. In particular, the impact of quantization on CLIP's performance
beyond accuracy remains underexplored. This work presents a large-scale
evaluation of quantization on CLIP models, assessing not only in-distribution
accuracy but a comprehensive suite of reliability metrics and revealing
counterintuitive results driven by pre-training source. We demonstrate that
quantization consistently improves calibration for typically underconfident
pre-trained models, while often degrading it for overconfident variants.
Intriguingly, this degradation in calibration does not preclude gains in other
reliability metrics; we find that OOD detection can still improve for these
same poorly calibrated models. Furthermore, we identify specific
quantization-aware training (QAT) methods that yield simultaneous gains in
zero-shot accuracy, calibration, and OOD robustness, challenging the view of a
strict efficiency-performance trade-off. These findings offer critical insights
for navigating the multi-objective problem of deploying efficient, reliable,
and robust VLMs by utilizing quantization beyond its conventional role.

### [68] [TABLET: A Large-Scale Dataset for Robust Visual Table Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21205)
*Iñigo Alonso,Imanol Miranda,Eneko Agirre,Mirella Lapata*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TABLET是一个大规模视觉表格理解数据集，包含400万个示例，覆盖20个任务，基于200万个独特表格，其中88%保留了原始可视化。该数据集解决了现有基准缺乏真实世界表格复杂性和视觉多样性的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前表格理解主要依赖像素级处理，但现有基准多使用合成渲染，缺乏真实世界表格的复杂性和视觉多样性。现有VTU数据集提供固定示例，无法访问底层序列化数据进行重新格式化。

Method: 构建TABLET数据集，包含成对的图像-HTML表示、全面元数据和溯源信息，将视觉语言模型（如Qwen2.5-VL-7B）在TABLET上进行微调。

Result: 在TABLET上微调视觉语言模型提高了在已见和未见VTU任务上的性能，同时增强了在真实世界表格可视化上的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 通过保留原始可视化并在统一的大规模集合中维护示例可追溯性，TABLET为未来VTU模型的鲁棒训练和可扩展评估奠定了基础。

Abstract: While table understanding increasingly relies on pixel-only settings where
tables are processed as visual representations, current benchmarks
predominantly use synthetic renderings that lack the complexity and visual
diversity of real-world tables. Additionally, existing visual table
understanding (VTU) datasets offer fixed examples with single visualizations
and pre-defined instructions, providing no access to underlying serialized data
for reformulation. We introduce TABLET, a large-scale VTU dataset with 4
million examples across 20 tasks, grounded in 2 million unique tables where 88%
preserve original visualizations. Each example includes paired image-HTML
representations, comprehensive metadata, and provenance information linking
back to the source datasets. Fine-tuning vision-language models like
Qwen2.5-VL-7B on TABLET improves performance on seen and unseen VTU tasks while
increasing robustness on real-world table visualizations. By preserving
original visualizations and maintaining example traceability in a unified
large-scale collection, TABLET establishes a foundation for robust training and
extensible evaluation of future VTU models.

TL;DR: 提出一种基于共形预测的新方法，让用户能直接控制生成解释的保真度，通过识别关键特征子集来保持模型预测，无需真实解释进行校准


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 特征归因方法在解释图像预测时存在鲁棒性差异，可能无法忠实反映黑盒模型的推理过程

Method: 提出四种一致性函数来量化解释与模型预测的符合程度，使用共形预测框架识别能够保持模型预测的关键特征子集

Result: 在6个图像数据集上使用5种解释器进行实证评估，FastSHAP在保真度和信息效率方面表现最优，基于超像素的一致性度量比像素级更有效

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种可控的解释保真度框架，无需真实解释标签，在保持预测准确性的同时提高了解释的可靠性

Abstract: Feature attribution methods are widely used for explaining image-based
predictions, as they provide feature-level insights that can be intuitively
visualized. However, such explanations often vary in their robustness and may
fail to faithfully reflect the reasoning of the underlying black-box model. To
address these limitations, we propose a novel conformal prediction-based
approach that enables users to directly control the fidelity of the generated
explanations. The method identifies a subset of salient features that is
sufficient to preserve the model's prediction, regardless of the information
carried by the excluded features, and without demanding access to ground-truth
explanations for calibration. Four conformity functions are proposed to
quantify the extent to which explanations conform to the model's predictions.
The approach is empirically evaluated using five explainers across six image
datasets. The empirical results demonstrate that FastSHAP consistently
outperforms the competing methods in terms of both fidelity and informational
efficiency, the latter measured by the size of the explanation regions.
Furthermore, the results reveal that conformity measures based on super-pixels
are more effective than their pixel-wise counterparts.

*Muxin Pu,Mei Kuan Lim,Chun Yong Chong,Chen Change Loy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Sigma是一个基于骨架的手语理解统一框架，通过早期融合、分层对齐学习和统一预训练解决了语义基础弱、局部细节与全局上下文不平衡、跨模态学习效率低等三个关键问题，在多个基准测试中取得了最先进的结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于骨架的手语理解方法面临三个主要限制：1）语义基础薄弱，模型难以将骨架数据中的低层运动模式与语言意义关联；2）局部细节与全局上下文不平衡；3）跨模态学习效率低下。

Method: 提出Sigma框架，包含：1）手语感知早期融合机制，促进视觉和文本模态的深度交互；2）分层对齐学习策略，在不同层级上最大化跨模态特征一致性；3）结合对比学习、文本匹配和语言建模的统一预训练框架。

Result: 在孤立手语识别、连续手语识别和无注释手语翻译等多个基准测试中取得了最先进的结果，证明了语义信息预训练的有效性和骨架数据作为独立解决方案的潜力。

Conclusion: Sigma框架通过语义信息丰富的预训练和有效的跨模态对齐策略，证明了基于骨架的手语理解方法的有效性，为不同手语和口语的多语言应用提供了强大解决方案。

Abstract: Pre-training has proven effective for learning transferable features in sign
language understanding (SLU) tasks. Recently, skeleton-based methods have
gained increasing attention because they can robustly handle variations in
subjects and backgrounds without being affected by appearance or environmental
factors. Current SLU methods continue to face three key limitations: 1) weak
semantic grounding, as models often capture low-level motion patterns from
skeletal data but struggle to relate them to linguistic meaning; 2) imbalance
between local details and global context, with models either focusing too
narrowly on fine-grained cues or overlooking them for broader context; and 3)
inefficient cross-modal learning, as constructing semantically aligned
representations across modalities remains difficult. To address these, we
propose Sigma, a unified skeleton-based SLU framework featuring: 1) a
sign-aware early fusion mechanism that facilitates deep interaction between
visual and textual modalities, enriching visual features with linguistic
context; 2) a hierarchical alignment learning strategy that jointly maximises
agreements across different levels of paired features from different
modalities, effectively capturing both fine-grained details and high-level
semantic relationships; and 3) a unified pre-training framework that combines
contrastive learning, text matching and language modelling to promote semantic
consistency and generalisation. Sigma achieves new state-of-the-art results on
isolated sign language recognition, continuous sign language recognition, and
gloss-free sign language translation on multiple benchmarks spanning different
sign and spoken languages, demonstrating the impact of semantically informative
pre-training and the effectiveness of skeletal data as a stand-alone solution
for SLU.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文对文本-图像生成评估中广泛使用的自动指标进行了系统性研究，发现没有单一指标在所有任务中表现一致，指标性能随组合问题的类型而变化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文本-图像生成技术发展迅速，但评估输出是否真正捕捉提示中的对象、属性和关系仍是一个核心挑战。当前评估严重依赖自动指标，但这些指标往往基于惯例或流行度而非经过人类判断验证。

Method: 对广泛使用的组合文本-图像评估指标进行广泛研究，分析它们在不同组合挑战中的行为，并比较不同指标家族与人类判断的一致性。

Result: 结果显示VQA-based指标虽然流行但并非普遍优越，某些基于嵌入的指标在特定情况下表现更强。仅基于图像的指标对组合评估贡献很小。

Conclusion: 研究强调了在评估和作为生成奖励模型使用时，需要谨慎和透明的指标选择，以实现可信的评估。

Abstract: Text-image generation has advanced rapidly, but assessing whether outputs
truly capture the objects, attributes, and relations described in prompts
remains a central challenge. Evaluation in this space relies heavily on
automated metrics, yet these are often adopted by convention or popularity
rather than validated against human judgment. Because evaluation and reported
progress in the field depend directly on these metrics, it is critical to
understand how well they reflect human preferences. To address this, we present
a broad study of widely used metrics for compositional text-image evaluation.
Our analysis goes beyond simple correlation, examining their behavior across
diverse compositional challenges and comparing how different metric families
align with human judgments. The results show that no single metric performs
consistently across tasks: performance varies with the type of compositional
problem. Notably, VQA-based metrics, though popular, are not uniformly
superior, while certain embedding-based metrics prove stronger in specific
cases. Image-only metrics, as expected, contribute little to compositional
evaluation, as they are designed for perceptual quality rather than alignment.
These findings underscore the importance of careful and transparent metric
selection, both for trustworthy evaluation and for their use as reward models
in generation. Project page is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出SlideMamba框架，结合Mamba架构和图神经网络，通过熵基自适应融合策略增强全切片图像分析，在基因融合和突变预测任务中表现优异


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 计算病理学需要从全切片图像中提取有意义的表示来支持临床和生物学任务，现有方法在捕捉局部空间关系和长距离上下文依赖方面存在局限性

Method: 集成Mamba模块（擅长长距离全局依赖）和GNN（强调细粒度短距离空间交互），采用熵基置信度加权机制进行自适应融合，动态平衡两个分支的贡献

Result: SlideMamba在PRAUC上达到0.751±0.05，显著优于MIL、Trans-MIL、Mamba-only、GNN-only和GAT-Mamba等方法，在ROC AUC、敏感性和特异性指标上也表现优异

Conclusion: 集成架构结合熵基自适应融合策略具有强大性能，在计算病理学的空间解析预测建模任务中展现出良好应用潜力

Abstract: Advances in computational pathology increasingly rely on extracting
meaningful representations from Whole Slide Images (WSIs) to support various
clinical and biological tasks. In this study, we propose a generalizable deep
learning framework that integrates the Mamba architecture with Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs) for enhanced WSI analysis. Our method is designed to capture
both local spatial relationships and long-range contextual dependencies,
offering a flexible architecture for digital pathology analysis. Mamba modules
excels in capturing long-range global dependencies, while GNNs emphasize
fine-grained short-range spatial interactions. To effectively combine these
complementary signals, we introduce an adaptive fusion strategy that uses an
entropy-based confidence weighting mechanism. This approach dynamically
balances contributions from both branches by assigning higher weight to the
branch with more confident (lower-entropy) predictions, depending on the
contextual importance of local versus global information for different
downstream tasks. We demonstrate the utility of our approach on a
representative task: predicting gene fusion and mutation status from WSIs. Our
framework, SlideMamba, achieves an area under the precision recall curve
(PRAUC) of 0.751 \pm 0.05, outperforming MIL (0.491 \pm 0.042), Trans-MIL (0.39
\pm 0.017), Mamba-only (0.664 \pm 0.063), GNN-only (0.748 \pm 0.091), and a
prior similar work GAT-Mamba (0.703 \pm 0.075). SlideMamba also achieves
competitive results across ROC AUC (0.738 \pm 0.055), sensitivity (0.662 \pm
0.083), and specificity (0.725 \pm 0.094). These results highlight the strength
of the integrated architecture, enhanced by the proposed entropy-based adaptive
fusion strategy, and suggest promising potential for application of
spatially-resolved predictive modeling tasks in computational pathology.

TL;DR: Hunyuan3D-Omni是一个统一的3D资产生成框架，支持图像、点云、体素、边界框和骨骼姿态等多种模态输入，实现细粒度可控的3D内容生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D生成模型主要依赖图像或文本条件，缺乏细粒度的跨模态控制，限制了可控性和实际应用。

Method: 基于Hunyuan3D 2.1构建统一跨模态架构，采用渐进式难度感知采样策略，对每种控制模态进行差异化训练。

Result: 实验表明额外控制模态提高了生成精度，支持几何感知变换，增强了生产工作流的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该框架通过多模态统一架构实现了更精确可控的3D资产生成，为实际应用提供了更好的支持。

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D-native generative models have accelerated asset
creation for games, film, and design. However, most methods still rely
primarily on image or text conditioning and lack fine-grained, cross-modal
controls, which limits controllability and practical adoption. To address this
gap, we present Hunyuan3D-Omni, a unified framework for fine-grained,
controllable 3D asset generation built on Hunyuan3D 2.1. In addition to images,
Hunyuan3D-Omni accepts point clouds, voxels, bounding boxes, and skeletal pose
priors as conditioning signals, enabling precise control over geometry,
topology, and pose. Instead of separate heads for each modality, our model
unifies all signals in a single cross-modal architecture. We train with a
progressive, difficulty-aware sampling strategy that selects one control
modality per example and biases sampling toward harder signals (e.g., skeletal
pose) while downweighting easier ones (e.g., point clouds), encouraging robust
multi-modal fusion and graceful handling of missing inputs. Experiments show
that these additional controls improve generation accuracy, enable
geometry-aware transformations, and increase robustness for production
workflows.

Motivation: CNN经常利用表面相关性进行"作弊"预测，而现有方法依赖人工标注，可扩展性有限。受认知科学启发，希望通过语言引导自动生成注意力监督。

Method: 利用视觉语言模型通过自然语言提示自动生成语义注意力图，引入辅助损失函数使CNN注意力与语言引导的注意力图对齐。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种可扩展的解决方案，能够在不依赖人工标注的情况下提升CNN的可靠性和认知合理性。

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) frequently "cheat" by exploiting
superficial correlations, raising concerns about whether they make predictions
for the right reasons. Inspired by cognitive science, which highlights the role
of attention in robust human perception, recent methods have sought to guide
model attention using concept-based supervision and explanation regularization.
However, these techniques depend on labor-intensive, expert-provided
annotations, limiting their scalability. We propose a scalable framework that
leverages vision-language models to automatically generate semantic attention
maps using natural language prompts. By introducing an auxiliary loss that
aligns CNN attention with these language-guided maps, our approach promotes
more reliable and cognitively plausible decision-making without manual
annotation. Experiments on challenging datasets, ColoredMNIST and DecoyMNIST,
show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on ColorMNIST and
remains competitive with annotation-heavy baselines on DecoyMNIST,
demonstrating improved generalization, reduced shortcut reliance, and model
attention that better reflects human intuition.

Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a critical medical imaging modality in
clinical diagnosis and research, yet its complexity and heterogeneity pose
challenges for automated analysis, particularly in scalable and generalizable
machine learning applications. While foundation models have revolutionized
natural language and vision tasks, their application to MRI remains limited due
to data scarcity and narrow anatomical focus. In this work, we present
Decipher-MR, a 3D MRI-specific vision-language foundation model trained on a
large-scale dataset comprising 200,000 MRI series from over 22,000 studies
spanning diverse anatomical regions, sequences, and pathologies. Decipher-MR
integrates self-supervised vision learning with report-guided text supervision
to build robust, generalizable representations, enabling effective adaptation
across broad applications. To enable robust and diverse clinical tasks with
minimal computational overhead, Decipher-MR supports a modular design that
enables tuning of lightweight, task-specific decoders attached to a frozen
pretrained encoder. Following this setting, we evaluate Decipher-MR across
diverse benchmarks including disease classification, demographic prediction,
anatomical localization, and cross-modal retrieval, demonstrating consistent
performance gains over existing foundation models and task-specific approaches.
Our results establish Decipher-MR as a scalable and versatile foundation for

Motivation: 当前视觉语言理解在多步推理任务中存在困难，现有基于LLM的方法无法获取细粒度视觉信息且难以复现。需要解决图像内容感知和可复现性问题。

Method: 构建包含Questioner、Answerer和Reasoner三个组件的SQ-InstructBLIP框架，通过迭代生成图像感知的子问题和子答案来辅助主问题推理。

Conclusion: 提出的SQ-InstructBLIP方法有效解决了视觉语言多步推理中的图像内容感知和可复现性问题，提升了推理准确性。

Abstract: The field of vision-language understanding has been actively researched in
recent years, thanks to the development of Large Language Models~(LLMs).
However, it still needs help with problems requiring multi-step reasoning, even
for very simple questions. Recent studies adopt LLMs to tackle this problem by
iteratively generating sub-questions and answers. However, there are
disadvantages such as 1) the fine-grained visual contents of images are not
available using LLMs that cannot read visual information, 2) internal
mechanisms are inaccessible and difficult to reproduce by using black-box LLMs.
To solve these problems, we propose the SQ (Self-Questioning)-InstructBLIP,
which improves inference performance by generating image-aware informative
sub-questions and sub-answers iteratively. The SQ-InstructBLIP, which consists
of a Questioner, Answerer, and Reasoner that share the same architecture.
Questioner and Answerer generate sub-questions and sub-answers to help infer
the main-question, and Reasoner performs reasoning on the main-question
considering the generated sub-question information. Our experiments show that
the proposed method SQ-InstructBLIP, which uses the generated sub-questions as
additional information when solving the VQA task, performs more accurate
reasoning than the previous works.

TL;DR: 本文提出了文本到图像生成模型中幻觉的定义和分类框架，将幻觉定义为模型基于先验知识或偏见而非输入提示产生的偏差驱动偏差，并提出了属性、关系和对象幻觉三类分类。


<details>

Motivation: 现有评估主要关注对齐性，检查提示指定元素是否出现，但忽略了模型在提示之外生成的内容。文本和视觉语言模型中的幻觉现象尚未在文本到图像生成模型中得到清晰界定。

Method: 提出了文本到图像生成模型中幻觉的定义框架，将其定义为偏见驱动的偏差，并建立了包含属性幻觉、关系幻觉和对象幻觉三个类别的分类法。

Result: 该框架为评估设定了上限，揭示了隐藏的偏见，为更丰富的文本到图像模型评估奠定了基础。

Conclusion: 该研究为文本到图像生成模型的幻觉现象提供了明确的定义和分类框架，有助于更全面地评估模型性能并揭示其内在偏见。

Abstract: In language and vision-language models, hallucination is broadly understood
as content generated from a model's prior knowledge or biases rather than from
the given input. While this phenomenon has been studied in those domains, it
has not been clearly framed for text-to-image (T2I) generative models. Existing
evaluations mainly focus on alignment, checking whether prompt-specified
elements appear, but overlook what the model generates beyond the prompt. We
argue for defining hallucination in T2I as bias-driven deviations and propose a
taxonomy with three categories: attribute, relation, and object hallucinations.
This framing introduces an upper bound for evaluation and surfaces hidden
biases, providing a foundation for richer assessment of T2I models.

Conclusion: 该框架通过分布鲁棒优化有效解决了微动作识别中的人物间差异问题，为心理评估和人机交互应用提供了更可靠的解决方案

Abstract: Micro-action Recognition is vital for psychological assessment and
human-computer interaction. However, existing methods often fail in real-world
scenarios because inter-person variability causes the same action to manifest
differently, hindering robust generalization. To address this, we propose the
Person Independence Universal Micro-action Recognition Framework, which
integrates Distributionally Robust Optimization principles to learn
person-agnostic representations. Our framework contains two plug-and-play
components operating at the feature and loss levels. At the feature level, the
Temporal-Frequency Alignment Module normalizes person-specific motion
characteristics with a dual-branch design: the temporal branch applies
Wasserstein-regularized alignment to stabilize dynamic trajectories, while the
frequency branch introduces variance-guided perturbations to enhance robustness
against person-specific spectral differences. A consistency-driven fusion
mechanism integrates both branches. At the loss level, the Group-Invariant
Regularized Loss partitions samples into pseudo-groups to simulate unseen
person-specific distributions. By up-weighting boundary cases and regularizing
subgroup variance, it forces the model to generalize beyond easy or frequent
samples, thus enhancing robustness to difficult variations. Experiments on the
large-scale MA-52 dataset demonstrate that our framework outperforms existing
methods in both accuracy and robustness, achieving stable generalization under
fine-grained conditions.

Motivation: 现有语义匹配方法存在几何歧义问题（依赖2D基础模型特征难以区分对称结构）和最近邻规则问题（忽略跨图像不可见性和流形保持），需要几何感知的像素描述符和整体密集对应机制。

Method: 保留VGGT早期特征阶段，微调后期阶段，添加语义头实现双向对应；在数据稀缺情况下通过循环一致性训练策略、合成数据增强和渐进式训练方法进行适配。

Result: 大量实验表明该方法在几何感知、匹配可靠性和流形保持方面表现优异，超越了之前的基线方法。

Conclusion: 基于3D几何基础模型的语义匹配方法能够有效解决现有方法的局限性，为计算机视觉中的密集对应任务提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Semantic matching aims to establish pixel-level correspondences between
instances of the same category and represents a fundamental task in computer
vision. Existing approaches suffer from two limitations: (i) Geometric
Ambiguity: Their reliance on 2D foundation model features (e.g., Stable
Diffusion, DINO) often fails to disambiguate symmetric structures, requiring
extra fine-tuning yet lacking generalization; (ii) Nearest-Neighbor Rule: Their
pixel-wise matching ignores cross-image invisibility and neglects manifold
preservation. These challenges call for geometry-aware pixel descriptors and
holistic dense correspondence mechanisms. Inspired by recent advances in 3D
geometric foundation models, we turn to VGGT, which provides geometry-grounded
features and holistic dense matching capabilities well aligned with these
needs. However, directly transferring VGGT is challenging, as it was originally
designed for geometry matching within cross views of a single instance,
misaligned with cross-instance semantic matching, and further hindered by the
scarcity of dense semantic annotations. To address this, we propose an approach
that (i) retains VGGT's intrinsic strengths by reusing early feature stages,
fine-tuning later ones, and adding a semantic head for bidirectional
correspondences; and (ii) adapts VGGT to the semantic matching scenario under
data scarcity through cycle-consistent training strategy, synthetic data
augmentation, and progressive training recipe with aliasing artifact
mitigation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves
superior geometry awareness, matching reliability, and manifold preservation,
outperforming previous baselines.

*Xinyu Liu,Guolei Sun,Cheng Wang,Yixuan Yuan,Ender Konukoglu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出MedVSR框架，针对医学视频超分辨率的特殊挑战，包括相机抖动、噪声和帧间突变等问题，通过交叉状态空间传播和内部状态空间重建模块提升重建质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高分辨率医学视频对准确诊断至关重要，但受硬件限制和生理约束难以获取。现有VSR模型在处理医学视频时面临对齐困难、易产生伪影和特征失真等问题。

Method: 1. 交叉状态空间传播(CSSP)：将远距离帧投影为状态空间模型的控制矩阵，选择性传播一致信息特征；2. 内部状态空间重建(ISSR)：结合长程空间特征学习和大核短程信息聚合，增强组织结构并减少伪影。

Result: 在四个医学数据集（包括内窥镜和白内障手术）上的实验表明，MedVSR在重建性能和处理效率上显著优于现有VSR模型。

Conclusion: MedVSR是针对医学视频超分辨率任务的定制化解决方案，有效解决了医学视频特有的挑战，为临床诊断提供了更高质量的图像支持。

Abstract: High-resolution (HR) medical videos are vital for accurate diagnosis, yet are
hard to acquire due to hardware limitations and physiological constraints.
Clinically, the collected low-resolution (LR) medical videos present unique
challenges for video super-resolution (VSR) models, including camera shake,
noise, and abrupt frame transitions, which result in significant optical flow
errors and alignment difficulties. Additionally, tissues and organs exhibit
continuous and nuanced structures, but current VSR models are prone to
introducing artifacts and distorted features that can mislead doctors. To this
end, we propose MedVSR, a tailored framework for medical VSR. It first employs
Cross State-Space Propagation (CSSP) to address the imprecise alignment by
projecting distant frames as control matrices within state-space models,
enabling the selective propagation of consistent and informative features to
neighboring frames for effective alignment. Moreover, we design an Inner
State-Space Reconstruction (ISSR) module that enhances tissue structures and
reduces artifacts with joint long-range spatial feature learning and
large-kernel short-range information aggregation. Experiments across four
datasets in diverse medical scenarios, including endoscopy and cataract
surgeries, show that MedVSR significantly outperforms existing VSR models in
reconstruction performance and efficiency. Code released at

TL;DR: 本文针对多模态推理模型训练中的两个主要限制（缺乏高质量长链思维数据和强化学习训练不稳定性），提出了方差感知采样方法、发布了大规模数据集和开源了多尺度模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态推理模型的进展受到两大限制：缺乏开放、大规模、高质量的长链思维数据，以及强化学习后训练的不稳定性。GRPO标准框架在奖励方差低时容易出现梯度消失问题。

Method: 提出了方差感知采样（VAS）数据选择策略，结合结果方差和轨迹多样性来提升奖励方差；发布了包含160万条长链思维数据和1.5万条RL问答对的大规模资源；开源了多尺度多模态推理模型。

Result: 在数学推理基准测试中证明了所策划数据和VAS方法的有效性。理论分析表明奖励方差下界了期望策略梯度幅度，VAS是实现这一保证的实用机制。

Conclusion: 该工作通过数据策略、资源发布和模型开源三方面贡献，有效解决了多模态推理模型训练的关键问题，为社区建立了标准化基准。

Abstract: Large multimodal reasoning models have achieved rapid progress, but their
advancement is constrained by two major limitations: the absence of open,
large-scale, high-quality long chain-of-thought (CoT) data, and the instability
of reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms in post-training. Group Relative
Policy Optimization (GRPO), the standard framework for RL fine-tuning, is prone
to gradient vanishing when reward variance is low, which weakens optimization
signals and impairs convergence. This work makes three contributions: (1) We
propose Variance-Aware Sampling (VAS), a data selection strategy guided by
Variance Promotion Score (VPS) that combines outcome variance and trajectory
diversity to promote reward variance and stabilize policy optimization. (2) We
release large-scale, carefully curated resources containing ~1.6M long CoT
cold-start data and ~15k RL QA pairs, designed to ensure quality, difficulty,
and diversity, along with a fully reproducible end-to-end training codebase.
(3) We open-source a family of multimodal reasoning models in multiple scales,
establishing standardized baselines for the community. Experiments across
mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of both the
curated data and the proposed VAS. Comprehensive ablation studies and analyses
provide further insight into the contributions of each component. In addition,
we theoretically establish that reward variance lower-bounds the expected
policy gradient magnitude, with VAS serving as a practical mechanism to realize
this guarantee. Our code, data, and checkpoints are available at

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于Prithvi-EO Vision Transformer架构的海洋科学基础模型，通过预训练重建Sentinel-3 OLCI数据，并在两个下游海洋地球观测任务中验证其性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 海洋科学中标记数据稀少且收集成本高，而预训练的基础模型有望改变AI在海洋科学中的应用方式。

Method: 使用Prithvi-EO Vision Transformer架构预训练模型来重建Sentinel-3 OLCI数据，然后对两个下游任务进行微调：叶绿素浓度量化和海洋初级生产力估算。

Result: 模型在利用少量高质量标记数据和捕捉详细海洋颜色空间模式方面表现出色，同时与点观测数据匹配良好。

Conclusion: 新一代地理空间AI模型有潜力为海洋生态系统及其在全球气候过程中的作用提供更稳健、数据驱动的见解。

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) Foundation models (FMs), pre-trained on massive
unlabelled datasets, have the potential to drastically change AI applications
in ocean science, where labelled data are often sparse and expensive to
collect. In this work, we describe a new foundation model using the Prithvi-EO
Vision Transformer architecture which has been pre-trained to reconstruct data
from the Sentinel-3 Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI). We evaluate the
model by fine-tuning on two downstream marine earth observation tasks. We first
assess model performance compared to current baseline models used to quantify
chlorophyll concentration. We then evaluate the FMs ability to refine remote
sensing-based estimates of ocean primary production. Our results demonstrate
the utility of self-trained FMs for marine monitoring, in particular for making
use of small amounts of high quality labelled data and in capturing detailed
spatial patterns of ocean colour whilst matching point observations. We
conclude that this new generation of geospatial AI models has the potential to
provide more robust, data-driven insights into ocean ecosystems and their role
in global climate processes.

TL;DR: SHINE是一个无需训练的图像合成框架，通过流形引导锚定损失、退化抑制引导和自适应背景融合技术，解决复杂光照和高分辨率输入下的物体插入问题，在多个基准测试中达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像合成模型在处理复杂光照（如准确阴影、水面反射）和多样化高分辨率输入时表现不佳。虽然现代文本到图像扩散模型已编码了物理和分辨率先验，但缺乏合适的框架来释放这些能力，而现有方法如潜在反演会锁定物体姿态或依赖脆弱的注意力操作。

Method: SHINE提出流形引导锚定损失，利用预训练定制适配器（如IP-Adapter）指导潜在表示以保持主体忠实性同时保护背景完整性；还引入退化抑制引导和自适应背景融合来消除低质量输出和可见接缝。

Result: 在ComplexCompo和DreamEditBench基准测试中，SHINE在标准指标（如DINOv2）和人类对齐评分（如DreamSim、ImageReward、VisionReward）上均达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: SHINE提供了一个有效的训练免费框架，能够实现高质量、无缝的图像合成，特别是在复杂光照和高分辨率场景下表现出色，为解决图像合成中的关键挑战提供了新思路。

Abstract: Image composition aims to seamlessly insert a user-specified object into a
new scene, but existing models struggle with complex lighting (e.g., accurate
shadows, water reflections) and diverse, high-resolution inputs. Modern
text-to-image diffusion models (e.g., SD3.5, FLUX) already encode essential
physical and resolution priors, yet lack a framework to unleash them without
resorting to latent inversion, which often locks object poses into contextually
inappropriate orientations, or brittle attention surgery. We propose SHINE, a
training-free framework for Seamless, High-fidelity Insertion with Neutralized
Errors. SHINE introduces manifold-steered anchor loss, leveraging pretrained
customization adapters (e.g., IP-Adapter) to guide latents for faithful subject
representation while preserving background integrity. Degradation-suppression
guidance and adaptive background blending are proposed to further eliminate
low-quality outputs and visible seams. To address the lack of rigorous
benchmarks, we introduce ComplexCompo, featuring diverse resolutions and
challenging conditions such as low lighting, strong illumination, intricate
shadows, and reflective surfaces. Experiments on ComplexCompo and
DreamEditBench show state-of-the-art performance on standard metrics (e.g.,
DINOv2) and human-aligned scores (e.g., DreamSim, ImageReward, VisionReward).
Code and benchmark will be publicly available upon publication.

TL;DR: QuantVGGT是一个针对视觉几何基础Transformer（VGGT）的量化框架，解决了亿级参数VGGT在PTQ量化中面临的重尾分布和校准样本不稳定的问题，实现了3.7倍内存减少和2.5倍加速，同时保持98%以上的重建精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于学习的3D重建模型（如VGGT）虽然取得了显著进展，但其巨大的计算和内存成本严重阻碍了实际部署。PTQ量化方法在压缩亿级VGGT时面临独特挑战：数据无关的特殊令牌导致重尾激活分布，3D数据的多视图特性使校准样本选择高度不稳定。

Method: 提出QuantVGGT框架，包含两个关键技术：1）双平滑细粒度量化，通过预全局Hadamard旋转和后局部通道平滑来缓解重尾分布和通道间方差；2）噪声过滤多样性采样，通过深层统计过滤异常值，构建帧感知多样性校准簇确保稳定的量化范围。

Result: 实验表明QuantVGGT在不同基准和比特宽度下均达到最先进结果，大幅超越之前的通用量化方法。4位QuantVGGT可实现3.7倍内存减少和2.5倍硬件推理加速，同时保持重建精度在完整精度版本的98%以上。

Conclusion: QuantVGGT展示了在资源受限场景下的巨大优势和实用性，为大规模3D重建模型的部署提供了有效的量化解决方案。

Abstract: Learning-based 3D reconstruction models, represented by Visual Geometry
Grounded Transformers (VGGTs), have made remarkable progress with the use of
large-scale transformers. Their prohibitive computational and memory costs
severely hinder real-world deployment. Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) has
become a common practice for compressing and accelerating models. However, we
empirically observe that PTQ faces unique obstacles when compressing
billion-scale VGGTs: the data-independent special tokens induce heavy-tailed
activation distributions, while the multi-view nature of 3D data makes
calibration sample selection highly unstable. This paper proposes the first
Quantization framework for VGGTs, namely QuantVGGT. This mainly relies on two
technical contributions: First, we introduce Dual-Smoothed Fine-Grained
Quantization, which integrates pre-global Hadamard rotation and post-local
channel smoothing to mitigate heavy-tailed distributions and inter-channel
variance robustly. Second, we design Noise-Filtered Diverse Sampling, which
filters outliers via deep-layer statistics and constructs frame-aware diverse
calibration clusters to ensure stable quantization ranges. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate that QuantVGGT achieves the state-of-the-art results
across different benchmarks and bit-width, surpassing the previous
state-of-the-art generic quantization method with a great margin. We highlight
that our 4-bit QuantVGGT can deliver a 3.7$\times$ memory reduction and
2.5$\times$ acceleration in real-hardware inference, while maintaining
reconstruction accuracy above 98\% of its full-precision counterpart. This
demonstrates the vast advantages and practicality of QuantVGGT in
resource-constrained scenarios. Our code is released in

TL;DR: NewtonGen是一个将数据驱动合成与可学习物理原理相结合的框架，通过可训练的神经牛顿动力学（NND）来建模和预测牛顿运动，为视频生成过程注入潜在动力学约束，实现物理一致的视频合成和精确参数控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大规模文本到视频生成的主要瓶颈是物理一致性和可控性。现有模型往往产生不真实的运动（如物体向上坠落）或速度和方向的突变，且缺乏精确的参数控制能力。这些限制源于模型仅从外观学习运动分布，而缺乏对底层动力学的理解。

Method: 提出NewtonGen框架，核心是可训练的神经牛顿动力学（NND），能够建模和预测各种牛顿运动。通过联合利用数据先验和动力学指导，将潜在动力学约束注入视频生成过程。

Result: NewtonGen能够实现物理一致的视频合成，并支持精确的参数控制，解决了现有模型在物理一致性方面的局限性。

Conclusion: 该工作通过整合数据驱动合成和可学习物理原理，为文本到视频生成提供了物理一致性和可控性的新解决方案，克服了当前模型仅依赖外观学习的根本限制。

Abstract: A primary bottleneck in large-scale text-to-video generation today is
physical consistency and controllability. Despite recent advances,
state-of-the-art models often produce unrealistic motions, such as objects
falling upward, or abrupt changes in velocity and direction. Moreover, these
models lack precise parameter control, struggling to generate physically
consistent dynamics under different initial conditions. We argue that this
fundamental limitation stems from current models learning motion distributions
solely from appearance, while lacking an understanding of the underlying
dynamics. In this work, we propose NewtonGen, a framework that integrates
data-driven synthesis with learnable physical principles. At its core lies
trainable Neural Newtonian Dynamics (NND), which can model and predict a
variety of Newtonian motions, thereby injecting latent dynamical constraints
into the video generation process. By jointly leveraging data priors and
dynamical guidance, NewtonGen enables physically consistent video synthesis
with precise parameter control.

Motivation: 让高质量图像生成技术能够在各种消费级设备（从手机到台式机）上运行，实现生成式AI的真正普及。

Method: 通过重新制定的分布匹配目标来蒸馏计算密集的整流流模型，引入时间步共享减少梯度噪声，采用分割时间步微调提升提示对齐，并结合文本编码器重构和专门量化等管道优化。

Result: 经过大规模用户研究评估，SD3.5-Flash在少步生成方法中表现优异，实现了快速生成和内存高效部署。

Conclusion: 该框架成功使先进的生成式AI技术真正适用于实际部署，实现了技术民主化。

Abstract: We present SD3.5-Flash, an efficient few-step distillation framework that
brings high-quality image generation to accessible consumer devices. Our
approach distills computationally prohibitive rectified flow models through a
reformulated distribution matching objective tailored specifically for few-step
generation. We introduce two key innovations: "timestep sharing" to reduce
gradient noise and "split-timestep fine-tuning" to improve prompt alignment.
Combined with comprehensive pipeline optimizations like text encoder
restructuring and specialized quantization, our system enables both rapid
generation and memory-efficient deployment across different hardware
configurations. This democratizes access across the full spectrum of devices,
from mobile phones to desktop computers. Through extensive evaluation including
large-scale user studies, we demonstrate that SD3.5-Flash consistently
outperforms existing few-step methods, making advanced generative AI truly
accessible for practical deployment.

Abstract: Medical Imaging (MI) datasets are fundamental to artificial intelligence in
healthcare. The accuracy, robustness, and fairness of diagnostic algorithms
depend on the data (and its quality) used to train and evaluate the models. MI
datasets used to be proprietary, but have become increasingly available to the
public, including on community-contributed platforms (CCPs) like Kaggle or
HuggingFace. While open data is important to enhance the redistribution of
data's public value, we find that the current CCP governance model fails to
uphold the quality needed and recommended practices for sharing, documenting,
and evaluating datasets. In this paper, we conduct an analysis of publicly
available machine learning datasets on CCPs, discussing datasets' context, and
identifying limitations and gaps in the current CCP landscape. We highlight
differences between MI and computer vision datasets, particularly in the
potentially harmful downstream effects from poor adoption of recommended
dataset management practices. We compare the analyzed datasets across several
dimensions, including data sharing, data documentation, and maintenance. We
find vague licenses, lack of persistent identifiers and storage, duplicates,
and missing metadata, with differences between the platforms. Our research
contributes to efforts in responsible data curation and AI algorithms for
healthcare.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 公众情绪在外交中至关重要，但传统调查方法耗时耗力且缺乏前瞻性分析能力，需要一种数据驱动的方法来优化外交事件叙述框架。

Method: 1) 训练语言模型预测外交事件的公众反应；2) 基于传播理论和专家意见确定可修改的文本特征；3) 开发反事实生成算法系统修改原始文本。

Result: 该框架成功将公众情绪转向更有利状态，成功率达70%。

Conclusion: 该框架可作为外交官、政策制定者和传播专家的实用工具，提供数据驱动的见解来优化外交事件叙述框架。

Abstract: Diplomatic events consistently prompt widespread public discussion and
debate. Public sentiment plays a critical role in diplomacy, as a good
sentiment provides vital support for policy implementation, helps resolve
international issues, and shapes a nation's international image. Traditional
methods for gauging public sentiment, such as large-scale surveys or manual
content analysis of media, are typically time-consuming, labor-intensive, and
lack the capacity for forward-looking analysis. We propose a novel framework
that identifies specific modifications for diplomatic event narratives to shift
public sentiment from negative to neutral or positive. First, we train a
language model to predict public reaction towards diplomatic events. To this
end, we construct a dataset comprising descriptions of diplomatic events and
their associated public discussions. Second, guided by communication theories
and in collaboration with domain experts, we predetermined several textual
features for modification, ensuring that any alterations changed the event's
narrative framing while preserving its core facts.We develop a counterfactual
generation algorithm that employs a large language model to systematically
produce modified versions of an original text. The results show that this
framework successfully shifted public sentiment to a more favorable state with
a 70\% success rate. This framework can therefore serve as a practical tool for
diplomats, policymakers, and communication specialists, offering data-driven
insights on how to frame diplomatic initiatives or report on events to foster a
more desirable public sentiment.

Motivation: 跨语言语音情感识别面临不同语言间音素变异性和说话者表达风格的差异，需要能够对齐不同说话者和语言间情感外部化的框架。

Method: 使用图聚类构建情感特定的说话者社区来捕捉共享的说话者特征，然后在说话者和音素空间进行双空间锚定以实现更好的跨语言情感迁移。

Result: 在MSP-Podcast（英语）和BIIC-Podcast（台湾普通话）语料库上的评估显示，该方法相比竞争基线具有更好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该方法为跨语言情感表征的共同性提供了有价值的见解，证明了双空间锚定在跨语言语音情感识别中的有效性。

Abstract: Cross-lingual speech emotion recognition (SER) remains a challenging task due
to differences in phonetic variability and speaker-specific expressive styles
across languages. Effectively capturing emotion under such diverse conditions
requires a framework that can align the externalization of emotions across
different speakers and languages. To address this problem, we propose a
speaker-style aware phoneme anchoring framework that aligns emotional
expression at the phonetic and speaker levels. Our method builds
emotion-specific speaker communities via graph-based clustering to capture
shared speaker traits. Using these groups, we apply dual-space anchoring in
speaker and phonetic spaces to enable better emotion transfer across languages.
Evaluations on the MSP-Podcast (English) and BIIC-Podcast (Taiwanese Mandarin)
corpora demonstrate improved generalization over competitive baselines and
provide valuable insights into the commonalities in cross-lingual emotion
representation.

TL;DR: 本研究评估了多种机器学习方法在区分ChatGPT-3.5生成的文本与人类写作文本方面的性能，发现DistilBERT表现最佳，而集成学习方法未能超越单一最佳模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型语言模型的快速普及，AI生成文本与人类文本的界限变得模糊，这引发了学术诚信、知识产权和错误信息传播等紧迫问题，因此需要可靠的AI文本检测方法来维护人类真实性并建立数字通信信任。

Method: 使用包含250对研究摘要的标注数据集，测试和比较了经典方法（基于词袋、词性标注和TF-IDF特征的逻辑回归）和基于Transformer的方法（BERT增强N-gram、DistilBERT、BERT加轻量级分类器、LSTM-based N-gram模型），并评估了这些模型的集成效果。

Result: DistilBERT达到整体最佳性能，逻辑回归和BERT-Custom提供可靠平衡的替代方案，LSTM和BERT-N-gram方法表现较差。三个最佳模型的最大投票集成未能超越DistilBERT本身。

Conclusion: 基于Transformer的单一表示方法优于模型多样性，本研究为开发更强大的检测框架奠定了基础，需要更大更丰富的数据集来跟上不断改进的生成式AI模型。

Abstract: The rapid adoption of large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT has
blurred the line between human and AI-generated texts, raising urgent questions
about academic integrity, intellectual property, and the spread of
misinformation. Thus, reliable AI-text detection is needed for fair assessment
to safeguard human authenticity and cultivate trust in digital communication.
In this study, we investigate how well current machine learning (ML) approaches
can distinguish ChatGPT-3.5-generated texts from human-written texts employing
a labeled data set of 250 pairs of abstracts from a wide range of research
topics. We test and compare both classical (Logistic Regression armed with
classical Bag-of-Words, POS, and TF-IDF features) and transformer-based (BERT
augmented with N-grams, DistilBERT, BERT with a lightweight custom classifier,
and LSTM-based N-gram models) ML detection techniques. As we aim to assess each
model's performance in detecting AI-generated research texts, we also aim to
test whether an ensemble of these models can outperform any single detector.
Results show DistilBERT achieves the overall best performance, while Logistic
Regression and BERT-Custom offer solid, balanced alternatives; LSTM- and
BERT-N-gram approaches lag. The max voting ensemble of the three best models
fails to surpass DistilBERT itself, highlighting the primacy of a single
transformer-based representation over mere model diversity. By comprehensively
assessing the strengths and weaknesses of these AI-text detection approaches,
this work lays a foundation for more robust transformer frameworks with larger,
richer datasets to keep pace with ever-improving generative AI models.

TL;DR: ConceptViz是一个可视化分析系统，旨在弥合稀疏自编码器特征与人类可理解概念之间的差距，通过识别-解释-验证的流程帮助研究人员探索LLM中的概念表示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管稀疏自编码器是提取LLM可解释特征的有前景技术，但这些特征并不天然与人类可理解概念对齐，导致解释过程繁琐且劳动密集。

Method: ConceptViz实现了新颖的识别=>解释=>验证流程，使用户能够使用感兴趣的概念查询SAE，交互式探索概念-特征对齐，并通过模型行为验证对应关系。

Result: 通过两个使用场景和用户研究证明了ConceptViz的有效性，结果显示该系统通过简化LLM中有意义概念表示的发现和验证过程，增强了可解释性研究。

Conclusion: ConceptViz有助于研究人员建立更准确的LLM特征心智模型，其代码和用户指南已公开可用。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance across a
wide range of natural language tasks. Understanding how LLMs internally
represent knowledge remains a significant challenge. Despite Sparse
Autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a promising technique for extracting
interpretable features from LLMs, SAE features do not inherently align with
human-understandable concepts, making their interpretation cumbersome and
labor-intensive. To bridge the gap between SAE features and human concepts, we
present ConceptViz, a visual analytics system designed for exploring concepts
in LLMs. ConceptViz implements a novel dentification => Interpretation =>
Validation pipeline, enabling users to query SAEs using concepts of interest,
interactively explore concept-to-feature alignments, and validate the
correspondences through model behavior verification. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of ConceptViz through two usage scenarios and a user study. Our
results show that ConceptViz enhances interpretability research by streamlining
the discovery and validation of meaningful concept representations in LLMs,
ultimately aiding researchers in building more accurate mental models of LLM
features. Our code and user guide are publicly available at

*Tomoaki Isoda*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SKILL-RAG是一种利用模型自我知识来筛选检索文档的新方法，通过强化学习框架显式提取模型自我知识，在句子级别过滤无关内容，提高RAG性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 检索系统可能返回无关内容，导致模型产生幻觉。需要理解模型"知道"和"不知道"的内容（自我知识），以更好地整合内部知识和外部检索知识。

Method: 提出SKILL-RAG方法，设计基于强化学习的训练框架，显式提取模型自我知识，采用句子级别粒度过滤无关内容，保留有用知识。

Result: 在多个问答基准测试上使用Llama2-7B和Qwen3-8B进行评估，SKILL-RAG不仅提高了生成质量，还显著减少了输入文档数量。

Conclusion: 实验结果验证了自我知识在指导高质量检索选择中的重要性，SKILL-RAG有效提升了RAG性能。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has significantly improved the
performance of large language models (LLMs) on knowledge-intensive tasks in
recent years. However, since retrieval systems may return irrelevant content,
incorporating such information into the model often leads to hallucinations.
Thus, identifying and filtering out unhelpful retrieved content is a key
challenge for improving RAG performance.To better integrate the internal
knowledge of the model with external knowledge from retrieval, it is essential
to understand what the model "knows" and "does not know" (which is also called
"self-knowledge"). Based on this insight, we propose SKILL-RAG (Self-Knowledge
Induced Learning and Filtering for RAG), a novel method that leverages the
model's self-knowledge to determine which retrieved documents are beneficial
for answering a given query. We design a reinforcement learning-based training
framework to explicitly elicit self-knowledge from the model and employs
sentence-level granularity to filter out irrelevant content while preserving
useful knowledge.We evaluate SKILL-RAG using Llama2-7B and Qwen3-8B on several
question answering benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that SKILL-RAG
not only improves generation quality but also significantly reduces the number
of input documents, validating the importance of self-knowledge in guiding the
selection of high-quality retrievals.

*Sirui Wang,Andong Chen,Tiejun Zhao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Emo-FiLM是一个细粒度情感建模框架，用于基于LLM的文本转语音系统，通过词级情感控制实现动态情感转换


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有情感文本转语音系统通常依赖句子级控制，无法捕捉句子内的动态情感变化，需要更细粒度的情感建模方法

Method: 使用Emo-FiLM框架，将emotion2vec的帧级特征对齐到词语获得词级情感标注，通过FiLM层映射并直接调制文本嵌入实现词级情感控制

Result: 实验表明Emo-FiLM在全局和细粒度任务上都优于现有方法，证明了其在表达性语音合成中的有效性和通用性

Conclusion: Emo-FiLM成功解决了现有E-TTS系统无法处理句子内动态情感变化的问题，为细粒度情感控制提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Emotional text-to-speech (E-TTS) is central to creating natural and
trustworthy human-computer interaction. Existing systems typically rely on
sentence-level control through predefined labels, reference audio, or natural
language prompts. While effective for global emotion expression, these
approaches fail to capture dynamic shifts within a sentence. To address this
limitation, we introduce Emo-FiLM, a fine-grained emotion modeling framework
for LLM-based TTS. Emo-FiLM aligns frame-level features from emotion2vec to
words to obtain word-level emotion annotations, and maps them through a
Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM) layer, enabling word-level emotion
control by directly modulating text embeddings. To support evaluation, we
construct the Fine-grained Emotion Dynamics Dataset (FEDD) with detailed
annotations of emotional transitions. Experiments show that Emo-FiLM
outperforms existing approaches on both global and fine-grained tasks,
demonstrating its effectiveness and generality for expressive speech synthesis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的对话推荐方法主要关注利用LLM的总结和分析能力，而忽略了训练问题，导致性能受限。

Method: 1. 设计基于LLM的偏好优化数据集构建策略用于强化学习训练；2. 在推理阶段提出自增强策略进一步挖掘训练获得的对话推荐潜力。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，该方法持续优于之前的最先进方法。

Conclusion: USB-Rec框架通过集成训练和推理优化，有效提升了LLM在对话推荐任务中的性能。

Abstract: Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have been widely employed in
Conversational Recommender Systems (CRSs). Unlike traditional language model
approaches that focus on training, all existing LLMs-based approaches are
mainly centered around how to leverage the summarization and analysis
capabilities of LLMs while ignoring the issue of training. Therefore, in this
work, we propose an integrated training-inference framework,
User-Simulator-Based framework (USB-Rec), for improving the performance of LLMs
in conversational recommendation at the model level. Firstly, we design a
LLM-based Preference Optimization (PO) dataset construction strategy for RL
training, which helps the LLMs understand the strategies and methods in
conversational recommendation. Secondly, we propose a Self-Enhancement Strategy
(SES) at the inference stage to further exploit the conversational
recommendation potential obtained from RL training. Extensive experiments on
various datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms previous
state-of-the-art methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前自动摘要系统在医疗、法律、金融等高风险领域缺乏对关键内容包含的可靠保证

Method: 基于句子级重要性分数校准阈值，实现可提取式文档摘要，支持用户指定关键内容的覆盖率和召回率，方法模型无关且仅需小规模校准集

Result: 在已建立的摘要基准测试中，Conformal Importance Summarization达到了理论保证的信息覆盖率

Conclusion: 该框架可与现有技术结合实现可靠可控的自动摘要，为AI摘要工具在关键应用中的安全部署铺平道路

Abstract: Automatic summarization systems have advanced rapidly with large language
models (LLMs), yet they still lack reliable guarantees on inclusion of critical
content in high-stakes domains like healthcare, law, and finance. In this work,
we introduce Conformal Importance Summarization, the first framework for
importance-preserving summary generation which uses conformal prediction to
provide rigorous, distribution-free coverage guarantees. By calibrating
thresholds on sentence-level importance scores, we enable extractive document
summarization with user-specified coverage and recall rates over critical
content. Our method is model-agnostic, requires only a small calibration set,
and seamlessly integrates with existing black-box LLMs. Experiments on
established summarization benchmarks demonstrate that Conformal Importance
Summarization achieves the theoretically assured information coverage rate. Our
work suggests that Conformal Importance Summarization can be combined with
existing techniques to achieve reliable, controllable automatic summarization,
paving the way for safer deployment of AI summarization tools in critical
applications. Code is available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SwasthLLM是一个统一的多语言医疗诊断框架，通过多任务学习和对比学习实现零样本跨语言诊断，在英语、印地语和孟加拉语上表现优异


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多语言医疗环境中临床文本自动诊断的挑战，特别是低资源语言标注数据稀缺和跨语言变异性问题

Method: 基于XLM-RoBERTa编码器，结合语言感知注意力机制、孪生对比学习模块、翻译一致性模块和多任务学习策略，使用MAML实现快速适应能力

Result: 在监督设置下达到97.22%准确率和97.17% F1分数，零样本场景下印地语92.78%准确率，孟加拉语73.33%准确率

Conclusion: SwasthLLM在多语言医疗诊断中表现出强大的泛化能力，特别适用于低资源语言环境

Abstract: In multilingual healthcare environments, automatic disease diagnosis from
clinical text remains a challenging task due to the scarcity of annotated
medical data in low-resource languages and the linguistic variability across
populations. This paper proposes SwasthLLM, a unified, zero-shot,
cross-lingual, and multi-task learning framework for medical diagnosis that
operates effectively across English, Hindi, and Bengali without requiring
language-specific fine-tuning. At its core, SwasthLLM leverages the
multilingual XLM-RoBERTa encoder augmented with a language-aware attention
mechanism and a disease classification head, enabling the model to extract
medically relevant information regardless of the language structure. To align
semantic representations across languages, a Siamese contrastive learning
module is introduced, ensuring that equivalent medical texts in different
languages produce similar embeddings. Further, a translation consistency module
and a contrastive projection head reinforce language-invariant representation
learning. SwasthLLM is trained using a multi-task learning strategy, jointly
optimizing disease classification, translation alignment, and contrastive
learning objectives. Additionally, we employ Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning
(MAML) to equip the model with rapid adaptation capabilities for unseen
languages or tasks with minimal data. Our phased training pipeline emphasizes
robust representation alignment before task-specific fine-tuning. Extensive
evaluation shows that SwasthLLM achieves high diagnostic performance, with a
test accuracy of 97.22% and an F1-score of 97.17% in supervised settings.
Crucially, in zero-shot scenarios, it attains 92.78% accuracy on Hindi and
73.33% accuracy on Bengali medical text, demonstrating strong generalization in
low-resource contexts.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MARS是一个基于角色的多智能体协作框架，通过模拟审稿流程来提升大语言模型的推理能力，在保持与多智能体辩论同等准确性的同时，将token使用量和推理时间减少约50%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多智能体辩论虽然能提升大语言模型的推理能力，但存在计算开销大的问题，需要频繁的智能体间通信。

Method: MARS采用审稿流程设计：作者智能体生成初始解决方案，审稿人智能体独立提供决策和评论，元审稿人整合反馈做出最终决策并指导进一步修订。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，MARS与多智能体辩论的准确性相当，但token使用量和推理时间减少了约50%。

Conclusion: MARS框架通过避免审稿人之间的交互，有效控制了计算成本，同时保持了高质量的推理能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive results in natural
language understanding, yet their reasoning capabilities remain limited when
operating as single agents. Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) has been proposed to
address this limitation by enabling collaborative reasoning among multiple
models in a round-table debate manner. While effective, MAD introduces
substantial computational overhead due to the number of agents involved and the
frequent communication required. In this paper, we propose MARS (Multi-Agent
Review System), a role-based collaboration framework inspired by the review
process. In MARS, an author agent generates an initial solution, reviewer
agents provide decisions and comments independently, and a meta-reviewer
integrates the feedback to make the final decision and guide further revision.
This design enhances reasoning quality while avoiding costly
reviewer-to-reviewer interactions, thereby controlling token consumption and
inference time. We compared MARS with both MAD and other state-of-the-art
reasoning strategies across multiple benchmarks. Extensive experiments with
different LLMs show that MARS matches the accuracy of MAD while reducing both
token usage and inference time by approximately 50\%. Code is available at

TL;DR: DS-MoE是一种动态深度专业化混合专家框架，通过为不同推理深度定制专家模块，实现按需激活的计算链，相比传统Transformer可节省16%计算量、提升35%推理速度，并在复杂推理任务上获得2.8%的准确率提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Transformer对所有输入使用相同的处理深度，导致简单查询浪费计算资源，复杂问题推理深度不足。需要一种能根据输入复杂度动态调整处理深度的自适应架构。

Method: 提出深度专业化混合专家(DS-MoE)框架，包含针对不同推理深度优化的专家模块（浅层模式识别、组合推理、逻辑推理、记忆整合、元认知监督），通过学习路由网络动态组装定制推理链。

Result: 在The Pile数据集上验证，DS-MoE相比均匀深度Transformer节省16%计算量，推理速度提升35%，复杂多步推理准确率提高2.8%，同时路由决策提供可解释的推理链。

Conclusion: DS-MoE通过深度专业化模块化处理，在效率、推理质量和可解释性方面实现显著提升，是自适应神经架构的重要进展。

Abstract: Contemporary transformer architectures apply identical processing depth to
all inputs, creating inefficiencies and limiting reasoning quality. Simple
factual queries are subjected to the same multilayered computation as complex
logical problems, wasting resources while constraining deep inference. To
overcome this, we came up with a concept of Dynamic Reasoning Chains through
Depth Specialised Mixture of Experts (DS-MoE), a modular framework that extends
the Mixture of Experts paradigm from width-based to depth specialised
computation. DS-MoE introduces expert modules optimised for distinct reasoning
depths, shallow pattern recognition, compositional reasoning, logical
inference, memory integration, and meta-cognitive supervision. A learned
routing network dynamically assembles custom reasoning chains, activating only
the necessary experts to match input complexity. The dataset on which we
trained and evaluated DS-MoE is on The Pile, an 800GB corpus covering diverse
domains such as scientific papers, legal texts, programming code, and web
content, enabling systematic assessment across reasoning depths. Experimental
results demonstrate that DS-MoE achieves up to 16 per cent computational
savings and 35 per cent faster inference compared to uniform-depth
transformers, while delivering 2.8 per cent higher accuracy on complex
multi-step reasoning benchmarks. Furthermore, routing decisions yield
interpretable reasoning chains, enhancing transparency and scalability. These
findings establish DS-MoE as a significant advancement in adaptive neural
architectures, demonstrating that depth-specialised modular processing can
simultaneously improve efficiency, reasoning quality, and interpretability in
large-scale language models.

Conclusion: SiniticMTError数据集为机器翻译社区提供了一个有价值的资源，可用于微调具有错误检测能力的模型，促进低资源语言机器翻译的发展。

Abstract: Despite major advances in machine translation (MT) in recent years, progress
remains limited for many low-resource languages that lack large-scale training
data and linguistic resources. Cantonese and Wu Chinese are two Sinitic

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准Transformer将文本处理为扁平标记序列，无法体现人类语言的层次结构，导致二次计算成本、弱组合泛化和不充分的语篇级建模。

Method: HRT构建多分辨率注意力机制，实现自下而上的组合和自上而下的语境化，通过跨尺度的指数序列缩减降低计算复杂度。

Result: 在GLUE、SuperGLUE、Long Range Arena和WikiText-103等基准测试中，HRT平均优于标准Transformer基线3.8%-6.1%，内存使用减少42%，推理延迟降低37%。

Conclusion: HRT是首个将计算结构与人类语言层次组织对齐的架构，证明了多尺度小波启发的处理既能获得理论效率增益，又能实际提升语言理解能力。

Abstract: Transformer architectures have achieved state-of-the-art performance across
natural language tasks, yet they fundamentally misrepresent the hierarchical
nature of human language by processing text as flat token sequences. This
results in quadratic computational cost, weak computational cost, weak
compositional generalization, and inadequate discourse-level modeling. We
propose Hierarchical Resolution Transformer (HRT), a novel wavelet-inspired
neural architecture that processes language simultaneously across multiple
resolutions, from characters to discourse-level units. HRT constructs a
multi-resolution attention, enabling bottom-up composition and top-down
contextualization. By employing exponential sequence reduction across scales,
HRT achieves O(nlogn) complexity, offering significant efficiency improvements
over standard transformers. We evaluated HRT on a diverse suite of benchmarks,
including GLUE, SuperGLUE, Long Range Arena, and WikiText-103, and results
demonstrated that HRT outperforms standard transformer baselines by an average
of +3.8% on GLUE, +4.5% on SuperGLUE, and +6.1% on Long Range Arena, while
reducing memory usage by 42% and inference latency by 37% compared to BERT and
GPT style models of similar parameter count. Ablation studies confirm the
effectiveness of cross-resolution attention and scale-specialized modules,
showing that each contributes independently to both efficiency and accuracy.
Our findings establish HRT as the first architecture to align computational
structure with the hierarchical organization of human language, demonstrating
that multi-scale, wavelet-inspired processing yields both theoretical
efficiency gains and practical improvements in language understanding.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实应用中常面临少样本和无训练的情况，传统方法需要大量用户评论历史或额外模型训练。LLMs虽然能处理低资源场景，但效果依赖于提示工程。

Method: 提出对话式提示方法：简单对话提示(SCP)仅使用用户自身评论，对比对话提示(CCP)插入其他用户或LLMs的错误回复并要求模型修正，以鼓励生成符合用户风格的文本。

Result: 在8个产品领域和5个LLMs上的实验表明，传统非对话提示生成的评论与随机用户相似，而SCP和CCP生成的评论更接近目标用户风格，即使每个用户只有2条评论。CCP在有高质量负样本时效果更好，SCP在无法收集负样本时仍具竞争力。

Conclusion: 对话式提示为少样本和无训练约束下的评论生成提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Personalized review generation helps businesses understand user preferences,
yet most existing approaches assume extensive review histories of the target
user or require additional model training. Real-world applications often face
few-shot and training-free situations, where only a few user reviews are
available and fine-tuning is infeasible. It is well known that large language
models (LLMs) can address such low-resource settings, but their effectiveness
depends on prompt engineering. In this paper, we propose Conversational
Prompting, a lightweight method that reformulates user reviews as multi-turn
conversations. Its simple variant, Simple Conversational Prompting (SCP),
relies solely on the user's own reviews, while the contrastive variant,
Contrastive Conversational Prompting (CCP), inserts reviews from other users or
LLMs as incorrect replies and then asks the model to correct them, encouraging
the model to produce text in the user's style. Experiments on eight product
domains and five LLMs showed that the conventional non-conversational prompt
often produced reviews similar to those written by random users, based on
text-based metrics such as ROUGE-L and BERTScore, and application-oriented
tasks like user identity matching and sentiment analysis. In contrast, both SCP
and CCP produced reviews much closer to those of the target user, even when
each user had only two reviews. CCP brings further improvements when
high-quality negative examples are available, whereas SCP remains competitive
when such data cannot be collected. These results suggest that conversational
prompting offers a practical solution for review generation under few-shot and
training-free constraints.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的搜索增强LLMs虽然通过集成检索来减少用户认知负担，但无法充分满足不同用户的多样化需求，缺乏对个性化效果的系统性评估。

Method: 通过长期深入的人类标注构建基准，标注者贡献自己的历史记录、编写详细信息需求的查询，并使用评分和诊断反馈评估响应。

Result: 基于BESPOKE的系统分析揭示了信息寻求任务中有效个性化的关键要求。

Conclusion: BESPOKE为个性化搜索增强LLMs的细粒度评估提供了基础，代码和数据已公开。

Abstract: Search-augmented large language models (LLMs) have advanced
information-seeking tasks by integrating retrieval into generation, reducing
users' cognitive burden compared to traditional search systems. Yet they remain
insufficient for fully addressing diverse user needs, which requires
recognizing how the same query can reflect different intents across users and
delivering information in preferred forms. While recent systems such as ChatGPT
and Gemini attempt personalization by leveraging user histories, systematic
evaluation of such personalization is under-explored. To address this gap, we
propose BESPOKE, the realistic benchmark for evaluating personalization in
search-augmented LLMs. BESPOKE is designed to be both realistic, by collecting
authentic chat and search histories directly from humans, and diagnostic, by
pairing responses with fine-grained preference scores and feedback. The
benchmark is constructed through long-term, deeply engaged human annotation,
where human annotators contributed their own histories, authored queries with
detailed information needs, and evaluated responses with scores and diagnostic
feedback. Leveraging BESPOKE, we conduct systematic analyses that reveal key
requirements for effective personalization in information-seeking tasks,
providing a foundation for fine-grained evaluation of personalized
search-augmented LLMs. Our code and data are available at

Motivation: 传统多模态关系抽取方法采用基于分类的范式，存在两个主要局限：(1)忽略实体类型和位置线索等结构约束；(2)缺乏对细粒度关系理解的语义表达能力。

Method: ROC框架包含三个关键组件：1)通过多模态编码器整合实体类型和位置信息；2)使用大语言模型将关系标签扩展为自然语言描述；3)基于语义相似度的对比学习来对齐实体-关系对。

Result: 在MNRE和MORE基准数据集上的实验表明，该方法达到了最先进的性能，并表现出更强的鲁棒性和可解释性。

Conclusion: ROC框架通过检索范式克服了传统分类方法的局限性，在多模态关系抽取任务中取得了显著改进。

Abstract: Relation extraction (RE) aims to identify semantic relations between entities
in unstructured text. Although recent work extends traditional RE to multimodal
scenarios, most approaches still adopt classification-based paradigms with
fused multimodal features, representing relations as discrete labels. This
paradigm has two significant limitations: (1) it overlooks structural
constraints like entity types and positional cues, and (2) it lacks semantic
expressiveness for fine-grained relation understanding. We propose
\underline{R}etrieval \underline{O}ver \underline{C}lassification (ROC), a
novel framework that reformulates multimodal RE as a retrieval task driven by
relation semantics. ROC integrates entity type and positional information
through a multimodal encoder, expands relation labels into natural language
descriptions using a large language model, and aligns entity-relation pairs via
semantic similarity-based contrastive learning. Experiments show that our
method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the benchmark datasets MNRE and
MORE and exhibits stronger robustness and interpretability.

*Amin Karimi Monsefi,Nikhil Bhendawade,Manuel Rafael Ciosici,Dominic Culver,Yizhe Zhang,Irina Belousova*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: FS-DFM是一种少步离散流匹配模型，通过将采样步数作为显式参数训练，实现8步采样即可达到1024步离散流模型的困惑度水平，采样速度提升128倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归语言模型生成速度慢，扩散语言模型需要数百到数千次模型评估才能达到高质量，存在速度与质量的权衡问题。

Method: 采用离散流匹配技术，训练模型在不同步数预算下保持一致性，配合可靠的更新规则和从长轨迹中提取的强教师指导。

Result: 在语言建模基准测试中，FS-DFM仅用8个采样步骤就实现了与1024步离散流基线相当的困惑度，采样速度提升128倍。

Conclusion: FS-DFM在保持高质量的同时显著提升了语言生成效率，为快速语言生成提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: Autoregressive language models (ARMs) deliver strong likelihoods, but are
inherently serial: they generate one token per forward pass, which limits
throughput and inflates latency for long sequences. Diffusion Language Models
(DLMs) parallelize across positions and thus appear promising for language
generation, yet standard discrete diffusion typically needs hundreds to
thousands of model evaluations to reach high quality, trading serial depth for
iterative breadth. We introduce FS-DFM, Few-Step Discrete Flow-Matching. A
discrete flow-matching model designed for speed without sacrificing quality.
The core idea is simple: make the number of sampling steps an explicit
parameter and train the model to be consistent across step budgets, so one big
move lands where many small moves would. We pair this with a reliable update
rule that moves probability in the right direction without overshooting, and
with strong teacher guidance distilled from long-run trajectories. Together,
these choices make few-step sampling stable, accurate, and easy to control. On
language modeling benchmarks, FS-DFM with 8 sampling steps achieves perplexity
parity with a 1,024-step discrete-flow baseline for generating 1,024 tokens
using a similar-size model, delivering up to 128 times faster sampling and
corresponding latency/throughput gains.

*Yaxiong Wu,Yongyue Zhang,Sheng Liang,Yong Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SGMem是一种基于句子图记忆的长期对话记忆管理方法，通过构建句子级图结构来组织多粒度对话信息，提升LLM在长对话问答中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于事实提取或摘要的方法难以有效组织和检索不同粒度的对话信息，无法满足长期对话代理对超出LLM上下文窗口的历史对话进行有效管理的需求。

Method: SGMem将对话表示为分块单元内的句子级图，捕捉轮次、回合和会话级别的关联，结合检索的原始对话和生成的记忆（如摘要、事实和见解）为LLM提供连贯相关上下文。

Result: 在LongMemEval和LoCoMo数据集上的实验表明，SGMem持续提高准确性，并在长期对话问答中优于强基线方法。

Conclusion: SGMem通过句子图结构有效管理长期对话记忆，为LLM提供更好的上下文支持，在长对话任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Long-term conversational agents require effective memory management to handle
dialogue histories that exceed the context window of large language models
(LLMs). Existing methods based on fact extraction or summarization reduce
redundancy but struggle to organize and retrieve relevant information across
different granularities of dialogue and generated memory. We introduce SGMem
(Sentence Graph Memory), which represents dialogue as sentence-level graphs
within chunked units, capturing associations across turn-, round-, and
session-level contexts. By combining retrieved raw dialogue with generated
memory such as summaries, facts and insights, SGMem supplies LLMs with coherent
and relevant context for response generation. Experiments on LongMemEval and
LoCoMo show that SGMem consistently improves accuracy and outperforms strong
baselines in long-term conversational question answering.

*Jungsoo Park,Ethan Mendes,Gabriel Stanovsky,Alan Ritter*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了PRECOG方法，通过文本描述和配置来预测语言模型性能，无需实际实验，旨在解决评估瓶颈问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型的进展受到评估瓶颈的制约：需要构建基准、评估模型和设置，然后迭代。因此研究能否在运行实验前预测结果。

Method: 研究文本性能预测：从脱敏任务描述和配置中估计模型得分，无需访问数据集实例。构建PRECOG语料库，包含多样化任务、领域和指标。使用配备检索模块的模型进行预测。

Result: 任务具有挑战性但可行：配备检索模块的模型达到中等预测性能，在准确性子集上平均绝对误差低至8.7。强推理模型进行多样化迭代查询，而开源模型表现滞后。在零泄漏设置下，GPT-5仍获得非平凡预测准确性。

Conclusion: PRECOG语料库和分析为开放式预期评估提供了初步步骤，支持难度估计和更智能的实验优先级排序。

Abstract: Progress in large language models is constrained by an evaluation bottleneck:
build a benchmark, evaluate models and settings, then iterate. We therefore ask
a simple question: can we forecast outcomes before running any experiments? We
study text-only performance forecasting: estimating a model's score from a
redacted task description and intended configuration, with no access to dataset
instances. To support systematic study, we curate PRECOG, a corpus of redacted
description-performance pairs spanning diverse tasks, domains, and metrics.
Experiments show the task is challenging but feasible: models equipped with a
retrieval module that excludes source papers achieve moderate prediction
performance with well-calibrated uncertainty, reaching mean absolute error as
low as 8.7 on the Accuracy subset at high-confidence thresholds. Our analysis
indicates that stronger reasoning models engage in diverse, iterative querying,
whereas current open-source models lag and often skip retrieval or gather
evidence with limited diversity. We further test a zero-leakage setting,
forecasting on newly released datasets or experiments before their papers are
indexed, where GPT-5 with built-in web search still attains nontrivial
prediction accuracy. Overall, our corpus and analyses offer an initial step
toward open-ended anticipatory evaluation, supporting difficulty estimation and
smarter experiment prioritization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的图RAG方法面临粒度困境：细粒度实体级图会产生高token成本并丢失上下文，而粗粒度文档级图无法捕捉细微关系。需要一种能够平衡粒度控制和检索效率的方法。

Method: 提出QCG-RAG框架，利用Doc2Query和Doc2Query--构建查询中心图，实现可控粒度的索引。采用定制的多跳检索机制通过生成的查询选择相关块。

Result: 在LiHuaWorld和MultiHop-RAG数据集上的实验表明，QCG-RAG在问答准确性上持续优于现有的基于块和基于图的RAG方法。

Conclusion: QCG-RAG为多跳推理建立了一个新范式，通过查询中心的方法提高了图质量和可解释性，在多跳问答任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Graph-based retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enriches large language
models (LLMs) with external knowledge for long-context understanding and
multi-hop reasoning, but existing methods face a granularity dilemma:
fine-grained entity-level graphs incur high token costs and lose context, while
coarse document-level graphs fail to capture nuanced relations. We introduce
QCG-RAG, a query-centric graph RAG framework that enables query-granular
indexing and multi-hop chunk retrieval. Our query-centric approach leverages
Doc2Query and Doc2Query{-}{-} to construct query-centric graphs with
controllable granularity, improving graph quality and interpretability. A
tailored multi-hop retrieval mechanism then selects relevant chunks via the
generated queries. Experiments on LiHuaWorld and MultiHop-RAG show that QCG-RAG
consistently outperforms prior chunk-based and graph-based RAG methods in
question answering accuracy, establishing a new paradigm for multi-hop
reasoning.

TL;DR: 本文提出了为日语口语评估任务构建语音识别器的方法，通过多任务训练和融合技术解决日语语音数据稀疏问题，显著降低了音素标签错误率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 日语虽然是资源丰富的语言，但包含重音标记的准确音素转录训练数据很少，需要解决数据稀疏问题来构建准确的日语语音识别器。

Method: 提出两种方法：1）多任务训练方案，引入辅助损失函数估计正交文本标签和音高模式；2）融合基于音素字母串和文本标记序列的两个估计器，使用有限状态转换器框架开发融合算法。

Result: 提出的方法将CSJ核心评估集的平均音素标签错误率从12.3%降低到7.1%，相比通用多语言识别器具有优势。

Conclusion: 多任务学习和融合技术对于构建准确的音素识别器是有效的，所提出的方法在日语口语评估任务中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: This paper presents methods for building speech recognizers tailored for
Japanese speaking assessment tasks. Specifically, we build a speech recognizer
that outputs phonemic labels with accent markers. Although Japanese is
resource-rich, there is only a small amount of data for training models to
produce accurate phonemic transcriptions that include accent marks. We propose
two methods to mitigate data sparsity. First, a multitask training scheme
introduces auxiliary loss functions to estimate orthographic text labels and
pitch patterns of the input signal, so that utterances with only orthographic
annotations can be leveraged in training. The second fuses two estimators, one
over phonetic alphabet strings, and the other over text token sequences. To
combine these estimates we develop an algorithm based on the finite-state
transducer framework. Our results indicate that the use of multitask learning
and fusion is effective for building an accurate phonemic recognizer. We show
that this approach is advantageous compared to the use of generic multilingual
recognizers. The relative advantages of the proposed methods were also
compared. Our proposed methods reduced the average of mora-label error rates
from 12.3% to 7.1% over the CSJ core evaluation sets.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖框架，首次将LLM提取的知识与预训练分子模型的结构特征相结合，以增强分子性质预测（MPP）性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然图神经网络（GNNs）和自监督学习在分子性质预测方面取得了进展，但人类先验知识的整合仍然不可或缺。LLMs存在知识空白和幻觉问题，特别是对于研究较少的分子性质。

Method: 通过提示LLMs生成领域相关知识和可执行代码进行分子向量化，产生基于知识的特征，然后与结构表示融合。使用了GPT-4o、GPT-4.1和DeepSeek-R1三种先进LLMs进行知识提取。

Result: 大量实验表明，该集成方法优于现有方法，证实了LLM衍生知识与结构信息的结合为MPP提供了稳健有效的解决方案。

Conclusion: LLM提取的知识与分子结构特征的集成是提升分子性质预测性能的有效途径，特别是在处理研究较少的分子性质时。

Abstract: Predicting molecular properties is a critical component of drug discovery.
Recent advances in deep learning, particularly Graph Neural Networks (GNNs),
have enabled end-to-end learning from molecular structures, reducing reliance
on manual feature engineering. However, while GNNs and self-supervised learning
approaches have advanced molecular property prediction (MPP), the integration
of human prior knowledge remains indispensable, as evidenced by recent methods
that leverage large language models (LLMs) for knowledge extraction. Despite
their strengths, LLMs are constrained by knowledge gaps and hallucinations,
particularly for less-studied molecular properties. In this work, we propose a
novel framework that, for the first time, integrates knowledge extracted from
LLMs with structural features derived from pre-trained molecular models to
enhance MPP. Our approach prompts LLMs to generate both domain-relevant
knowledge and executable code for molecular vectorization, producing
knowledge-based features that are subsequently fused with structural
representations. We employ three state-of-the-art LLMs, GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, and
DeepSeek-R1, for knowledge extraction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our integrated method outperforms existing approaches, confirming that the
combination of LLM-derived knowledge and structural information provides a
robust and effective solution for MPP.

*Jonathan Rusert*

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为RedHerring的新型攻击方法，旨在使对抗文本攻击检测模型不可靠，同时保持分类器的正确性，从而在分类器和检测器之间制造矛盾。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的对抗文本攻击检测模型虽然能成功识别被修改的文本，但其可靠性尚未得到充分研究。作者希望探索攻击者如何针对检测模型进行攻击。

Method: RedHerring攻击通过修改文本来使检测模型预测为攻击，同时保持分类器的正确预测。在4个数据集上对3个检测器和4个分类器进行了测试，并提出了简单的置信度检查作为防御方法。

Result: RedHerring能够将检测准确率降低20-71个百分点，同时保持（甚至提高）分类器准确率。提出的置信度检查防御方法无需重新训练即可大幅提高检测准确率。

Conclusion: 这种新型威胁模型为理解攻击者如何针对检测模型提供了新的视角，揭示了检测模型可能存在的脆弱性。

Abstract: In response to adversarial text attacks, attack detection models have been
proposed and shown to successfully identify text modified by adversaries.
Attack detection models can be leveraged to provide an additional check for NLP
models and give signals for human input. However, the reliability of these
models has not yet been thoroughly explored. Thus, we propose and test a novel
attack setting and attack, RedHerring. RedHerring aims to make attack detection
models unreliable by modifying a text to cause the detection model to predict
an attack, while keeping the classifier correct. This creates a tension between
the classifier and detector. If a human sees that the detector is giving an
``incorrect'' prediction, but the classifier a correct one, then the human will
see the detector as unreliable. We test this novel threat model on 4 datasets
against 3 detectors defending 4 classifiers. We find that RedHerring is able to
drop detection accuracy between 20 - 71 points, while maintaining (or
improving) classifier accuracy. As an initial defense, we propose a simple
confidence check which requires no retraining of the classifier or detector and
increases detection accuracy greatly. This novel threat model offers new
insights into how adversaries may target detection models.

TL;DR: 提出了两种新的对抗文本攻击选择策略（Hybrid和Dynamic Select），通过结合BinarySelect和GreedySelect的优势，显著降低了攻击所需的查询次数，同时保持攻击效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着基于transformer的架构复杂性增加，对抗文本攻击测试的计算成本急剧上升，现有黑盒攻击方法需要大量查询，对资源有限的研究者来说效率低下且不实用。

Method: Hybrid Select通过引入大小阈值来决定使用哪种选择算法，将广义BinarySelect技术与GreedySelect结合；Dynamic Select通过学习每种选择方法应应用于多长文本，提供另一种结合广义Binary和GreedySelect的方法。

Result: 在4个数据集和6个目标模型上，最佳方法（句子级Hybrid Select）平均可将每次攻击所需的查询次数减少25.82%，且不损失攻击效果。

Conclusion: 提出的新攻击选择策略有效解决了对抗文本攻击中的计算效率问题，为资源有限的研究者提供了实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Adversarial text attack research plays a crucial role in evaluating the
robustness of NLP models. However, the increasing complexity of
transformer-based architectures has dramatically raised the computational cost
of attack testing, especially for researchers with limited resources (e.g.,
GPUs). Existing popular black-box attack methods often require a large number
of queries, which can make them inefficient and impractical for researchers. To
address these challenges, we propose two new attack selection strategies called
Hybrid and Dynamic Select, which better combine the strengths of previous
selection algorithms. Hybrid Select merges generalized BinarySelect techniques
with GreedySelect by introducing a size threshold to decide which selection
algorithm to use. Dynamic Select provides an alternative approach of combining
the generalized Binary and GreedySelect by learning which lengths of texts each
selection method should be applied to. This greatly reduces the number of
queries needed while maintaining attack effectiveness (a limitation of
BinarySelect). Across 4 datasets and 6 target models, our best
method(sentence-level Hybrid Select) is able to reduce the number of required
queries per attack up 25.82\% on average against both encoder models and LLMs,
without losing the effectiveness of the attack.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MI-Fuse是一个去噪标签融合框架，通过结合大型音频语言模型和源域训练的SER分类器作为辅助教师，在目标域无标签音频数据上训练学生模型，以解决领域不匹配问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的语音情感识别在领域不匹配情况下表现不佳，且源数据不可用，只能通过API访问大型音频语言模型。需要开发一种方法，仅使用无标签目标域音频和API访问的LALM，使学生模型在目标域表现优于LALM。

Method: 提出MI-Fuse框架，将源域训练的SER分类器作为辅助教师与LALM结合，通过互信息不确定性加权多个随机预测的均值分布，并使用指数移动平均教师稳定训练过程。

Result: 在三个公共情感数据集和六个跨领域转移任务上的实验显示，学生模型持续优于LALM，且比最强基线高出3.9%。

Conclusion: 该方法在不共享源数据的情况下增强了情感感知语音系统，实现了现实的适应能力。

Abstract: Large audio-language models (LALMs) show strong zero-shot ability on speech
tasks, suggesting promise for speech emotion recognition (SER). However, SER in
real-world deployments often fails under domain mismatch, where source data are
unavailable and powerful LALMs are accessible only through an API. We ask:
given only unlabeled target-domain audio and an API-only LALM, can a student
model be adapted to outperform the LALM in the target domain? To this end, we
propose MI-Fuse, a denoised label fusion framework that supplements the LALM
with a source-domain trained SER classifier as an auxiliary teacher. The
framework draws multiple stochastic predictions from both teachers, weights
their mean distributions by mutual-information-based uncertainty, and
stabilizes training with an exponential moving average teacher. Experiments
across three public emotion datasets and six cross-domain transfers show
consistent gains, with the student surpassing the LALM and outperforming the
strongest baseline by 3.9%. This approach strengthens emotion-aware speech
systems without sharing source data, enabling realistic adaptation.

Motivation: 现有无监督神经语法归纳模型面临表达能力瓶颈，导致语法模型过大但性能不佳。核心问题是概率分布崩溃现象限制了模型的表达能力。

Method: 分析了神经参数化关键组件中概率分布崩溃的出现时机和机制，提出了针对性的崩溃松弛神经参数化方法来解决这一问题。

Result: 该方法显著提高了解析性能，同时使模型能够在多种语言中使用更紧凑的语法，通过大量实证分析验证了有效性。

Conclusion: 崩溃松弛神经参数化是解决无监督语法归纳中表达能力瓶颈的有效方法，为构建更高效紧凑的语法模型提供了新思路。

Abstract: Unsupervised neural grammar induction aims to learn interpretable
hierarchical structures from language data. However, existing models face an
expressiveness bottleneck, often resulting in unnecessarily large yet
underperforming grammars. We identify a core issue, $\textit{probability
distribution collapse}$, as the underlying cause of this limitation. We analyze
when and how the collapse emerges across key components of neural
parameterization and introduce a targeted solution, $\textit{collapse-relaxing
neural parameterization}$, to mitigate it. Our approach substantially improves
parsing performance while enabling the use of significantly more compact
grammars across a wide range of languages, as demonstrated through extensive
empirical analysis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的问答模型在处理复杂问题时缺乏可靠的置信度评估机制，需要一种能够无缝集成到各种模型中的通用框架来提升推理可靠性。

Method: 首先筛选子问题集合探索不同推理路径，然后比较答案候选的置信度分数来选择最可靠的最终答案，完全基于模型自身的置信度评分。

Result: C2R在不同模型和基准测试中均表现出稳定的性能提升，能够无缝集成到现有QA模型中。

Conclusion: 该研究不仅提出了有效的置信度引导推理框架，还深入分析了子问题数量和质量对模型推理鲁棒性的影响，为可靠推理提供了重要见解。

Abstract: We propose Confidence-guided Refinement Reasoning (C2R), a novel
training-free framework applicable to question-answering (QA) tasks across
text, image, and video domains. C2R strategically constructs and refines
sub-questions and their answers (sub-QAs), deriving a better confidence score
for the target answer. C2R first curates a subset of sub-QAs to explore diverse
reasoning paths, then compares the confidence scores of the resulting answer
candidates to select the most reliable final answer. Since C2R relies solely on
confidence scores derived from the model itself, it can be seamlessly
integrated with various existing QA models, demonstrating consistent
performance improvements across diverse models and benchmarks. Furthermore, we
provide essential yet underexplored insights into how leveraging sub-QAs
affects model behavior, specifically analyzing the impact of both the quantity
and quality of sub-QAs on achieving robust and reliable reasoning.

Motivation: 传统观点认为领域特定的监督微调会损害LLM的通用能力，但作者希望通过实证和理论分析重新审视这一权衡关系。

Method: 提出了Token-Adaptive Loss Reweighting方法，并与L2正则化、LoRA、模型平均、FLOW等基线方法进行比较。

Result: 实验表明虽然没有任何方法能完全消除权衡，但TALR在平衡领域特定增益和通用能力方面表现最佳。

Conclusion: 提出了实用指南：使用小学习率实现有利权衡，当需要更强平衡时采用TALR策略。

Abstract: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on domain-specific datasets is a common approach
to adapt Large Language Models (LLMs) to specialized tasks but is often
believed to degrade their general capabilities. In this work, we revisit this
trade-off and present both empirical and theoretical insights. First, we show
that SFT does not always hurt: using a smaller learning rate can substantially
mitigate general performance degradation while preserving comparable
target-domain performance. We then provide a theoretical analysis that explains
these phenomena and further motivates a new method, Token-Adaptive Loss
Reweighting (TALR). Building on this, and recognizing that smaller learning
rates alone do not fully eliminate general-performance degradation in all
cases, we evaluate a range of strategies for reducing general capability loss,
including L2 regularization, LoRA, model averaging, FLOW, and our proposed
TALR. Experimental results demonstrate that while no method completely
eliminates the trade-off, TALR consistently outperforms these baselines in
balancing domain-specific gains and general capabilities. Finally, we distill
our findings into practical guidelines for adapting LLMs to new domains: (i)
using a small learning rate to achieve a favorable trade-off, and (ii) when a
stronger balance is further desired, adopt TALR as an effective strategy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型的内部表示基本单元尚未明确定义，限制了对其机制的理解。神经元存在多义性问题，而特征则面临重建不可靠和不稳定的担忧，需要找到更合适的表示单元。

Method: 提出原子理论，定义原子为基本表示单元；引入原子内积校正表示偏移；证明原子满足受限等距性质；训练阈值激活的稀疏自编码器在Gemma2-2B、Gemma2-9B和Llama3.1-8B模型上进行验证。

Result: 在多个模型层上平均达到99.9%的稀疏重建精度；99.8%的原子满足唯一性条件，而神经元和特征分别只有0.5%和68.2%；揭示了稀疏自编码器大小与恢复能力之间的关系。

Conclusion: 原子理论系统地定义和验证了大语言模型的原子表示，为理解内部表示提供了理论框架，为机制可解释性奠定了基础，证明原子比神经元和特征更能忠实捕捉大语言模型的内在表示。

Abstract: The fundamental units of internal representations in large language models
(LLMs) remain undefined, limiting further understanding of their mechanisms.
Neurons or features are often regarded as such units, yet neurons suffer from
polysemy, while features face concerns of unreliable reconstruction and
instability. To address this issue, we propose the Atoms Theory, which defines
such units as atoms. We introduce the atomic inner product (AIP) to correct
representation shifting, formally define atoms, and prove the conditions that
atoms satisfy the Restricted Isometry Property (RIP), ensuring stable sparse
representations over atom set and linking to compressed sensing. Under stronger
conditions, we further establish the uniqueness and exact $\ell_1$
recoverability of the sparse representations, and provide guarantees that
single-layer sparse autoencoders (SAEs) with threshold activations can reliably
identify the atoms. To validate the Atoms Theory, we train threshold-activated
SAEs on Gemma2-2B, Gemma2-9B, and Llama3.1-8B, achieving 99.9% sparse
reconstruction across layers on average, and more than 99.8% of atoms satisfy
the uniqueness condition, compared to 0.5% for neurons and 68.2% for features,
showing that atoms more faithfully capture intrinsic representations of LLMs.
Scaling experiments further reveal the link between SAEs size and recovery
capacity. Overall, this work systematically introduces and validates Atoms
Theory of LLMs, providing a theoretical framework for understanding internal
representations and a foundation for mechanistic interpretability. Code

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在复杂任务中表现出强大推理能力，但在知识密集型场景（如KGQA）中仍存在幻觉和事实错误问题，这源于结构化知识图谱与非结构化查询之间的语义鸿沟。

Method: 提出灵活的Enrich-on-Graph框架，利用LLM的先验知识丰富知识图谱，通过三个图质量评估指标分析查询-图对齐，实现高效证据提取和精确推理。

Result: 在两个KGQA基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，EoG能有效生成高质量KG并达到最先进的性能，同时确保低计算成本、可扩展性和跨方法适应性。

Conclusion: EoG框架成功解决了KGQA中的语义鸿沟问题，为知识密集型任务提供了高效、可扩展的解决方案，并通过理论验证证明了优化目标的有效性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit strong reasoning capabilities in complex
tasks. However, they still struggle with hallucinations and factual errors in
knowledge-intensive scenarios like knowledge graph question answering (KGQA).
We attribute this to the semantic gap between structured knowledge graphs (KGs)
and unstructured queries, caused by inherent differences in their focuses and
structures. Existing methods usually employ resource-intensive, non-scalable
workflows reasoning on vanilla KGs, but overlook this gap. To address this
challenge, we propose a flexible framework, Enrich-on-Graph (EoG), which
leverages LLMs' prior knowledge to enrich KGs, bridge the semantic gap between
graphs and queries. EoG enables efficient evidence extraction from KGs for
precise and robust reasoning, while ensuring low computational costs,
scalability, and adaptability across different methods. Furthermore, we propose
three graph quality evaluation metrics to analyze query-graph alignment in KGQA
task, supported by theoretical validation of our optimization objectives.
Extensive experiments on two KGQA benchmark datasets indicate that EoG can
effectively generate high-quality KGs and achieve the state-of-the-art
performance. Our code and data are available at

*Taehee Park,Heejin Do,Gary Geunbae Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PoCO方法通过先利用大语言模型进行过度修正以最大化召回率，然后使用小模型进行后修正来平衡语法错误校正的召回率和精确度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决小语言模型在语法错误校正中召回率低（过度保守）和大语言模型精确度低（过度修正）的问题

Method: 先使用LLM进行过度修正以最大化召回率，然后训练小模型对LLM输出进行后修正以提升精确度

Result: 实验证明PoCO能有效平衡GEC性能，在保持竞争力的精确度同时显著提升召回率

Conclusion: PoCO方法成功结合了LLMs的生成能力和小监督模型的可靠性，改善了语法错误校正的整体质量

Abstract: Robust supervised fine-tuned small Language Models (sLMs) often show high
reliability but tend to undercorrect. They achieve high precision at the cost
of low recall. Conversely, Large Language Models (LLMs) often show the opposite
tendency, making excessive overcorrection, leading to low precision. To
effectively harness the strengths of LLMs to address the recall challenges in
sLMs, we propose Post-Correction via Overcorrection (PoCO), a novel approach
that strategically balances recall and precision. PoCO first intentionally
triggers overcorrection via LLM to maximize recall by allowing comprehensive
revisions, then applies a targeted post-correction step via fine-tuning smaller
models to identify and refine erroneous outputs. We aim to harmonize both
aspects by leveraging the generative power of LLMs while preserving the
reliability of smaller supervised models. Our extensive experiments demonstrate
that PoCO effectively balances GEC performance by increasing recall with
competitive precision, ultimately improving the overall quality of grammatical
error correction.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为"cheat-sheet ICL"的方法，将多示例上下文学习的信息提炼为简洁的文本摘要，在推理时使用更少的token达到相似或更好的性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型的多示例上下文学习虽然有效但计算成本高，需要处理更长的输入token

Method: 将多示例上下文学习的信息蒸馏为简洁的文本摘要（cheat sheet），在推理时使用该摘要作为上下文

Result: 在具有挑战性的推理任务上，cheat-sheet ICL使用更少的token实现了与多示例ICL相当或更好的性能，并且无需测试时检索就能达到基于检索的ICL的效果

Conclusion: cheat-sheet ICL是利用LLMs进行下游任务的一个实用替代方案

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) enable effective in-context
learning (ICL) with many-shot examples, but at the cost of high computational
demand due to longer input tokens. To address this, we propose cheat-sheet ICL,
which distills the information from many-shot ICL into a concise textual
summary (cheat sheet) used as the context at inference time. Experiments on
challenging reasoning tasks show that cheat-sheet ICL achieves comparable or
better performance than many-shot ICL with far fewer tokens, and matches
retrieval-based ICL without requiring test-time retrieval. These findings
demonstrate that cheat-sheet ICL is a practical alternative for leveraging LLMs
in downstream tasks.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于树搜索的零样本迭代句子重写算法，用于在保护隐私的同时保持文本的自然性和实用性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型语言模型在云服务中的广泛应用，用户输入可能无意中暴露敏感信息，现有文本匿名化技术难以平衡隐私保护与文本自然性

Method: 采用零样本、基于树搜索的迭代句子重写算法，通过结构化搜索引导的奖励模型逐步重写隐私敏感片段

Result: 在隐私敏感数据集上的实验表明，该方法显著优于现有基线方法，在隐私保护和实用性之间实现了更好的平衡

Conclusion: 该方法为隐私保护文本处理提供了有效的解决方案，能够在不牺牲文本质量的前提下有效保护用户隐私

Abstract: The increasing adoption of large language models (LLMs) in cloud-based
services has raised significant privacy concerns, as user inputs may
inadvertently expose sensitive information. Existing text anonymization and
de-identification techniques, such as rule-based redaction and scrubbing, often
struggle to balance privacy preservation with text naturalness and utility. In
this work, we propose a zero-shot, tree-search-based iterative sentence
rewriting algorithm that systematically obfuscates or deletes private
information while preserving coherence, relevance, and naturalness. Our method
incrementally rewrites privacy-sensitive segments through a structured search
guided by a reward model, enabling dynamic exploration of the rewriting space.
Experiments on privacy-sensitive datasets show that our approach significantly
outperforms existing baselines, achieving a superior balance between privacy
protection and utility preservation.

<details>

Motivation: 现有RAG系统的引用通常在句子或段落级别，存在两个问题：长句子包含大量无关内容；句子级别引用可能遗漏验证所需的关键信息，迫使用户阅读上下文。

Method: 开发了子句级别引用的标注指南并构建数据集；提出一个引用生成框架，利用LLM自动生成微调数据，并使用信用模型过滤低质量样本。

Result: 在构建的数据集上的实验表明，该方法能够生成高质量且更易读的引用。

Conclusion: 提出的子句级别引用方法能够生成既简洁又充分的引用，减少用户验证生成输出正确性所需的工作量。

Abstract: In retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) question answering systems,
generating citations for large language model (LLM) outputs enhances
verifiability and helps users identify potential hallucinations. However, we
observe two problems in the citations produced by existing attribution methods.
First, the citations are typically provided at the sentence or even paragraph
level. Long sentences or paragraphs may include a substantial amount of
irrelevant content. Second, sentence-level citations may omit information that
is essential for verifying the output, forcing users to read the surrounding
context. In this paper, we propose generating sub-sentence citations that are
both concise and sufficient, thereby reducing the effort required by users to
confirm the correctness of the generated output. To this end, we first develop
annotation guidelines for such citations and construct a corresponding dataset.
Then, we propose an attribution framework for generating citations that adhere
to our standards. This framework leverages LLMs to automatically generate
fine-tuning data for our task and employs a credit model to filter out
low-quality examples. Our experiments on the constructed dataset demonstrate
that the propose approach can generate high-quality and more readable
citations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在语言建模中展现出潜力，但缺乏每个去噪步骤的精确概率估计，导致生成过程不可预测和不一致，需要控制关键标记来引导生成方向

Method: 提出WeFT方法，基于扩散理论为标记分配不同的权重（根据熵值），实现加权的监督微调

Result: 在s1K、s1K-1.1和3k样本上训练，在Sudoku、Countdown、GSM8K和MATH-500四个推理基准上分别比标准SFT提升39%、64%和83%

Conclusion: WeFT方法有效解决了扩散语言模型的监督微调挑战，显著提升了推理能力，代码和模型将公开

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently shown strong potential in language modeling,
offering faster generation compared to traditional autoregressive approaches.
However, applying supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to diffusion models remains
challenging, as they lack precise probability estimates at each denoising step.
While the diffusion mechanism enables the model to reason over entire
sequences, it also makes the generation process less predictable and often
inconsistent. This highlights the importance of controlling key tokens that
guide the direction of generation. To address this issue, we propose WeFT, a
weighted SFT method for diffusion language models, where tokens are assigned
different weights based on their entropy. Derived from diffusion theory, WeFT
delivers substantial gains: training on s1K, s1K-1.1, and 3k samples from
open-r1, it achieves relative improvements of 39%, 64%, and 83% over standard
SFT on four widely used reasoning benchmarks (Sudoku, Countdown, GSM8K, and
MATH-500). The code and models will be made publicly available.

TL;DR: 本文系统研究了让医学推理模型生成答案排名列表的方法，提出了提示和微调两种方法，发现强化微调比监督微调在多种答案格式上表现更稳健。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床决策通常需要考虑多个选项而非单一答案，但现有医学推理模型主要训练生成单一答案，无法满足开放性问题中多答案排名的需求。

Method: 提出了两种方法：提示法（低成本引导模型响应）和微调法（包括监督微调和强化微调），并设计了针对排名列表格式的新奖励函数。

Result: 研究发现虽然某些监督微调模型能在特定答案格式上泛化，但强化微调训练的模型在多种格式上表现更稳健。模型可能无法选择基准偏好的标准答案，但能识别有效答案。

Conclusion: 这是首个系统研究医学推理模型生成排名列表答案方法的工作，为开发超越单一答案的替代答案格式提供了初步探索。

Abstract: This paper presents a systematic study on enabling medical reasoning models
(MRMs) to generate ranked lists of answers for open-ended questions. Clinical
decision-making rarely relies on a single answer but instead considers multiple
options, reducing the risks of narrow perspectives. Yet current MRMs are
typically trained to produce only one answer, even in open-ended settings. We
propose an alternative format: ranked lists and investigate two approaches:
prompting and fine-tuning. While prompting is a cost-effective way to steer an
MRM's response, not all MRMs generalize well across different answer formats:
choice, short text, and list answers. Based on our prompting findings, we train
and evaluate MRMs using supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement
fine-tuning (RFT). SFT teaches a model to imitate annotated responses, and RFT
incentivizes exploration through the responses that maximize a reward. We
propose new reward functions targeted at ranked-list answer formats, and
conduct ablation studies for RFT. Our results show that while some SFT models
generalize to certain answer formats, models trained with RFT are more robust
across multiple formats. We also present a case study on a modified MedQA with
multiple valid answers, finding that although MRMs might fail to select the
benchmark's preferred ground truth, they can recognize valid answers. To the
best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic investigation of approaches
for enabling MRMs to generate answers as ranked lists. We hope this work
provides a first step toward developing alternative answer formats that are
beneficial beyond single answers in medical domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型语言模型在处理超长文档摘要时普遍存在信息丢失、事实不一致和连贯性问题，需要新的方法来提升长文档摘要质量。

Method: 采用对抗性多智能体框架，包含摘要生成器、审阅者、测验生成器、审阅者和考生智能体，通过协作和对抗机制实现迭代优化。

Result: 在三个广泛使用的长文档摘要基准测试中，SummQ在ROUGE、BERTScore、LLM-as-a-Judge和人工评估指标上显著优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: 这项工作为长文档摘要建立了一种新方法，利用对抗性智能体协作来提升摘要质量，多智能体协作动态和测验机制的有效性得到了验证。

Abstract: Long document summarization remains a significant challenge for current large
language models (LLMs), as existing approaches commonly struggle with
information loss, factual inconsistencies, and coherence issues when processing
excessively long documents. We propose SummQ, a novel adversarial multi-agent
framework that addresses these limitations through collaborative intelligence
between specialized agents operating in two complementary domains:
summarization and quizzing. Our approach employs summary generators and
reviewers that work collaboratively to create and evaluate comprehensive
summaries, while quiz generators and reviewers create comprehension questions
that serve as continuous quality checks for the summarization process. This
adversarial dynamic, enhanced by an examinee agent that validates whether the
generated summary contains the information needed to answer the quiz questions,
enables iterative refinement through multifaceted feedback mechanisms. We
evaluate SummQ on three widely used long document summarization benchmarks.
Experimental results demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms
existing state-of-the-art methods across ROUGE and BERTScore metrics, as well
as in LLM-as-a-Judge and human evaluations. Our comprehensive analyses reveal
the effectiveness of the multi-agent collaboration dynamics, the influence of
different agent configurations, and the impact of the quizzing mechanism. This
work establishes a new approach for long document summarization that uses
adversarial agentic collaboration to improve summarization quality.

TL;DR: 提出MemLens方法，通过分析数字令牌在生成过程中的概率轨迹来检测LLM的记忆化现象，发现受污染样本在早期层就锁定答案，而干净样本则在整个模型深度中逐渐积累证据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于词汇重叠和困惑度的记忆化检测方法泛化能力差，对隐式污染数据效果不佳，需要更有效的检测手段。

Method: MemLens方法分析数字令牌在模型各层的概率变化轨迹，识别受污染样本的"捷径"行为模式。通过LoRA微调注入设计样本进行验证。

Result: 受污染样本和干净样本展现出明显分离的推理轨迹，验证了MemLens能够捕捉真实的记忆化信号而非虚假相关。

Conclusion: MemLens提供了一种有效的记忆化检测方法，揭示了LLM在处理记忆化内容时的内部工作机制，为模型评估提供了新视角。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are commonly evaluated on challenging benchmarks
such as AIME and Math500, which are susceptible to contamination and risk of
being memorized. Existing detection methods, which primarily rely on
surface-level lexical overlap and perplexity, demonstrate low generalization
and degrade significantly when encountering implicitly contaminated data. In
this paper, we propose MemLens (An Activation Lens for Memorization Detection)
to detect memorization by analyzing the probability trajectories of numeric
tokens during generation. Our method reveals that contaminated samples exhibit
``shortcut'' behaviors, locking onto an answer with high confidence in the
model's early layers, whereas clean samples show more gradual evidence
accumulation across the model's full depth. We observe that contaminated and
clean samples exhibit distinct and well-separated reasoning trajectories. To
further validate this, we inject carefully designed samples into the model
through LoRA fine-tuning and observe the same trajectory patterns as in
naturally contaminated data. These results provide strong evidence that MemLens
captures genuine signals of memorization rather than spurious correlations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于局部性理论和跨语言依赖长度最小化证据，研究旨在调和线性距离和层次结构对记忆负荷的解释，为句子理解中的记忆负荷理论提供更精确的评估方法。

Method: 使用统一依赖树库和混合效应模型，在多语言中同时评估句子长度、依赖长度和干预者复杂度对记忆负荷的预测能力，将记忆负荷操作化为特征错误绑定和特征干扰的线性总和。

Result: 所有三个因素都与记忆负荷正相关，句子长度影响最广泛，干预者复杂度在线性距离之外提供了额外的解释力。

Conclusion: 研究发现将依赖长度视为重要表面特征，同时将干预头识别为更直接的整合和维护需求指标，调和了线性和层次视角，为评估记忆负荷理论提供了原则性路径。

Abstract: This study examines whether sentence-level memory load in comprehension is
better explained by linear proximity between syntactically related words or by
the structural density of the intervening material. Building on locality-based
accounts and cross-linguistic evidence for dependency length minimization, the
work advances Intervener Complexity-the number of intervening heads between a
head and its dependent-as a structurally grounded lens that refines linear
distance measures. Using harmonized dependency treebanks and a mixed-effects
framework across multiple languages, the analysis jointly evaluates sentence
length, dependency length, and Intervener Complexity as predictors of the
Memory-load measure. Studies in Psycholinguistics have reported the
contributions of feature interference and misbinding to memory load during
processing. For this study, I operationalized sentence-level memory load as the
linear sum of feature misbinding and feature interference for tractability;
current evidence does not establish that their cognitive contributions combine
additively. All three factors are positively associated with memory load, with
sentence length exerting the broadest influence and Intervener Complexity
offering explanatory power beyond linear distance. Conceptually, the findings
reconcile linear and hierarchical perspectives on locality by treating
dependency length as an important surface signature while identifying
intervening heads as a more proximate indicator of integration and maintenance
demands. Methodologically, the study illustrates how UD-based graph measures
and cross-linguistic mixed-effects modelling can disentangle linear and
structural contributions to processing efficiency, providing a principled path
for evaluating competing theories of memory load in sentence comprehension.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前工具调用研究主要集中于英语，缺乏对阿拉伯语等其他语言的研究，需要填补这一空白以开发阿拉伯语工具增强代理。

Method: 通过翻译和适配两个开源工具调用数据集为阿拉伯语，在阿拉伯语LLM的基础版本和后期训练变体上进行广泛实验。

Result: 研究结果揭示了开发阿拉伯语工具增强代理的最佳策略，包括对三个关键研究问题的实证分析。

Conclusion: 该研究为开发鲁棒的阿拉伯语工具增强代理提供了关键见解，填补了非英语语言工具调用研究的空白。

Abstract: Tool calling is a critical capability that allows Large Language Models
(LLMs) to interact with external systems, significantly expanding their
utility. However, research and resources for tool calling are predominantly
English-centric, leaving a gap in our understanding of how to enable this
functionality for other languages, such as Arabic. This paper investigates
three key research questions: (1) the necessity of in-language (Arabic)
tool-calling data versus relying on cross-lingual transfer, (2) the effect of
general-purpose instruction tuning on tool-calling performance, and (3) the
value of fine-tuning on specific, high-priority tools. To address these
questions, we conduct extensive experiments using base and post-trained
variants of an open-weight Arabic LLM. To enable this study, we bridge the
resource gap by translating and adapting two open-source tool-calling datasets
into Arabic. Our findings provide crucial insights into the optimal strategies
for developing robust tool-augmented agents for Arabic.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在教育领域，LLMs已被研究作为学生和教师的辅助工具，但如何利用LLMs构建自动评估系统来评估学术文本输入问题（使用评分标准）仍需深入探索。

Method: 提出了五种评估系统：JudgeLM评估、参考辅助评估、无参考评估、加法评估和自适应评估。在包含110个高等教育学生计算机科学答案的自定义数据集上，使用JudgeLM、Llama-3.1-8B和DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B三个模型进行测试，并与人工评估结果对比。

Result: 参考辅助评估方法表现最佳，具有最低的中位数绝对偏差（0.945）和均方根偏差（1.214），能够提供公平的评分以及深入完整的评估。其他方法在简洁答案评估或信息完整性方面存在不足。

Conclusion: 基于人工智能的自动评估系统，配合适当的方法论，有潜力作为其他学术资源的补充工具。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can act as evaluators, a role studied by methods
like LLM-as-a-Judge and fine-tuned judging LLMs. In the field of education,
LLMs have been studied as assistant tools for students and teachers. Our
research investigates LLM-driven automatic evaluation systems for academic
Text-Input Problems using rubrics. We propose five evaluation systems that have
been tested on a custom dataset of 110 answers about computer science from
higher education students with three models: JudgeLM, Llama-3.1-8B and
DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B. The evaluation systems include: The JudgeLM
evaluation, which uses the model's single answer prompt to obtain a score;
Reference Aided Evaluation, which uses a correct answer as a guide aside from
the original context of the question; No Reference Evaluation, which ommits the
reference answer; Additive Evaluation, which uses atomic criteria; and Adaptive
Evaluation, which is an evaluation done with generated criteria fitted to each
question. All evaluation methods have been compared with the results of a human
evaluator. Results show that the best method to automatically evaluate and
score Text-Input Problems using LLMs is Reference Aided Evaluation. With the
lowest median absolute deviation (0.945) and the lowest root mean square
deviation (1.214) when compared to human evaluation, Reference Aided Evaluation
offers fair scoring as well as insightful and complete evaluations. Other
methods such as Additive and Adaptive Evaluation fail to provide good results
in concise answers, No Reference Evaluation lacks information needed to
correctly assess questions and JudgeLM Evaluations have not provided good
results due to the model's limitations. As a result, we conclude that
Artificial Intelligence-driven automatic evaluation systems, aided with proper
methodologies, show potential to work as complementary tools to other academic
resources.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文证明因果掩码可以在没有参数或输入因果依赖的情况下，在注意力分数中诱导出位置依赖模式，这种模式倾向于偏好附近的查询-键对，与常见位置编码的行为类似。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然显式位置编码（如RoPE）是Transformer解码器中位置信息的主要来源，但因果掩码也提供位置信息。本文旨在研究因果掩码作为位置信息源的重要性。

Method: 通过理论分析和实证分析相结合的方法，研究因果掩码如何诱导注意力模式，并分析其与RoPE的交互作用。

Result: 研究发现因果掩码诱导的注意力模式倾向于偏好附近的查询-键对，而且因果掩码与RoPE的交互会扭曲RoPE的相对注意力分数模式，使其变为非相对模式。在现代大语言模型中一致观察到这种效应。

Conclusion: 因果掩码应被视为与显式位置编码同等重要的位置信息源，在模型设计中需要同时考虑两者的作用。

Abstract: While explicit positional encodings such as RoPE are a primary source of
positional information in Transformer decoders, the causal mask also provides
positional information. In this work, we prove that the causal mask can induce
position-dependent patterns in attention scores, even without parameters or
causal dependency in the input. Our theoretical analysis indicates that the
induced attention pattern tends to favor nearby query-key pairs, mirroring the
behavior of common positional encodings. Empirical analysis confirms that
trained models exhibit the same behavior, with learned parameters further
amplifying these patterns. Notably, we found that the interaction of causal
mask and RoPE distorts RoPE's relative attention score patterns into
non-relative ones. We consistently observed this effect in modern large
language models, suggesting the importance of considering the causal mask as a
source of positional information alongside explicit positional encodings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在现实场景中的应用增加，理解它们同时遵循多个指令的能力变得至关重要，但现有评估方法在计算上不可行。

Method: 创建ManyIFEval（文本生成，最多10个指令）和StyleMBPP（代码生成，最多6个指令）两个基准，在10个LLMs上进行实验，并开发三种回归模型来预测未见指令组合的性能。

Result: 实验显示随着指令数量增加，模型性能持续下降；逻辑回归模型使用指令数量作为解释变量，可以以约10%的误差预测多指令跟随性能，即使对于未见指令组合也有效。

Conclusion: 相对较小的样本量（ManyIFEval 500个，StyleMBPP 300个）足以进行性能估计，能够高效评估LLMs在各种指令组合下的表现。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to real-world
scenarios, it becomes crucial to understand their ability to follow multiple
instructions simultaneously. To systematically evaluate these capabilities, we
introduce two specialized benchmarks for fundamental domains where multiple
instructions following is important: Many Instruction-Following Eval
(ManyIFEval) for text generation with up to ten instructions, and Style-aware
Mostly Basic Programming Problems (StyleMBPP) for code generation with up to
six instructions. Our experiments with the created benchmarks across ten LLMs
reveal that performance consistently degrades as the number of instructions
increases. Furthermore, given the fact that evaluating all the possible
combinations of multiple instructions is computationally impractical in actual
use cases, we developed three types of regression models that can estimate
performance on both unseen instruction combinations and different numbers of
instructions which are not used during training. We demonstrate that a logistic
regression model using instruction count as an explanatory variable can predict
performance of following multiple instructions with approximately 10% error,
even for unseen instruction combinations. We show that relatively modest sample
sizes (500 for ManyIFEval and 300 for StyleMBPP) are sufficient for performance
estimation, enabling efficient evaluation of LLMs under various instruction
combinations.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了SoM-1K基准数据集，这是首个专门评估基础模型在材料强度问题上的大规模多模态基准。研究发现当前基础模型在复杂工程问题上表现不佳，并提出了DoI提示策略来改善视觉理解问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基础模型在各种领域表现出色，但在复杂多模态工程问题上的性能尚未得到充分探索。作者旨在评估基础模型在材料强度等工程问题上的能力。

Method: 创建了包含1,065个标注材料强度问题的SoM-1K数据集，包含文本问题和示意图。提出了DoI（图像描述）提示策略，用专家生成的文本描述替代视觉图表。评估了8个代表性基础模型（LLMs和VLMs）。

Result: 当前基础模型在工程问题上表现显著不足，最佳模型准确率仅为56.6%。有趣的是，配备DoI的LLMs通常优于配备视觉图表的VLMs。错误分析显示DoI能有效减少视觉误解错误。

Conclusion: 这项工作为工程AI建立了严谨的基准，并强调了在基础模型中开发更强大多模态推理能力的迫切需求，特别是在科学和工程背景下。

Abstract: Foundation models have shown remarkable capabilities in various domains, but
their performance on complex, multimodal engineering problems remains largely
unexplored. We introduce SoM-1K, the first large-scale multimodal benchmark
dataset dedicated to evaluating foundation models on problems in the strength
of materials (SoM). The dataset, which contains 1,065 annotated SoM problems,
mirrors real-world engineering tasks by including both textual problem
statements and schematic diagrams. Due to the limited capabilities of current
foundation models in understanding complicated visual information, we propose a
novel prompting strategy called Descriptions of Images (DoI), which provides
rigorous expert-generated text descriptions of the visual diagrams as the
context. We evaluate eight representative foundation models, including both
large language models (LLMs) and vision language models (VLMs). Our results
show that current foundation models struggle significantly with these
engineering problems, with the best-performing model achieving only 56.6%
accuracy. Interestingly, we found that LLMs, when provided with DoI, often
outperform VLMs provided with visual diagrams. A detailed error analysis
reveals that DoI plays a crucial role in mitigating visual misinterpretation
errors, suggesting that accurate text-based descriptions can be more effective
than direct image input for current foundation models. This work establishes a
rigorous benchmark for engineering AI and highlights a critical need for
developing more robust multimodal reasoning capabilities in foundation models,
particularly in scientific and engineering contexts.

### [135] [Which Cultural Lens Do Models Adopt? On Cultural Positioning Bias and Agentic Mitigation in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21080)
*Yixin Wan,Xingrun Chen,Kai-Wei Chang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文识别并系统研究了LLMs中的文化定位偏见，即模型默认生成立场与主流美国文化对齐，将其他文化视为局外人。提出了CultureLens基准和两种推理时缓解方法，特别是基于代理的框架能有效减轻偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 发现LLMs在生成内容时存在微妙的文化公平性问题，倾向于从主流美国文化视角生成内容，对其他文化表现出外部性，这可能导致文化偏见传播。

Method: 1) 提出CultureLens基准，包含4000个生成提示和3个评估指标；2) 设计文化情境访谈脚本生成任务；3) 提出两种缓解方法：基于提示的FIP方法和基于代理的MFA框架（包括单代理和多代理两种管道）。

Result: 对5个最先进LLMs的评估显示：模型在美国情境脚本中88%以上采用内部视角，但对非主流文化主要采用外部立场。基于代理的方法在减轻偏见方面表现出有效性。

Conclusion: LLMs存在显著的文化定位偏见，基于代理的缓解方法为解决生成式LLMs中的偏见问题提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have unlocked a wide range of downstream
generative applications. However, we found that they also risk perpetuating
subtle fairness issues tied to culture, positioning their generations from the
perspectives of the mainstream US culture while demonstrating salient
externality towards non-mainstream ones. In this work, we identify and
systematically investigate this novel culture positioning bias, in which an
LLM's default generative stance aligns with a mainstream view and treats other
cultures as outsiders. We propose the CultureLens benchmark with 4000
generation prompts and 3 evaluation metrics for quantifying this bias through
the lens of a culturally situated interview script generation task, in which an
LLM is positioned as an onsite reporter interviewing local people across 10
diverse cultures. Empirical evaluation on 5 state-of-the-art LLMs reveals a
stark pattern: while models adopt insider tones in over 88 percent of
US-contexted scripts on average, they disproportionately adopt mainly outsider
stances for less dominant cultures. To resolve these biases, we propose 2
inference-time mitigation methods: a baseline prompt-based Fairness
Intervention Pillars (FIP) method, and a structured Mitigation via Fairness
Agents (MFA) framework consisting of 2 pipelines: (1) MFA-SA (Single-Agent)
introduces a self-reflection and rewriting loop based on fairness guidelines.
(2) MFA-MA (Multi-Agent) structures the process into a hierarchy of specialized
agents: a Planner Agent(initial script generation), a Critique Agent (evaluates
initial script against fairness pillars), and a Refinement Agent (incorporates
feedback to produce a polished, unbiased script). Empirical results showcase
the effectiveness of agent-based methods as a promising direction for
mitigating biases in generative LLMs.

*Mohammad Hosseini,Kimia Hosseini,Shayan Bali,Zahra Zanjani,Saeedeh Momtazi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PerHalluEval是首个针对波斯语的动态幻觉评估基准，通过三阶段LLM驱动流程生成可信答案和摘要，专门检测外在和内在幻觉，评估了12个LLM在波斯语幻觉检测方面的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 幻觉问题是影响所有大语言模型的持续性问题，特别是在波斯语等低资源语言中更为严重，需要专门的评估基准来检测和缓解这一问题。

Method: 采用三阶段LLM驱动流程，结合人工验证生成可信答案和摘要，利用生成token的对数概率选择最可信的幻觉实例，并让人工标注者突出波斯语特定语境。

Result: 评估的12个LLM在检测波斯语幻觉文本方面普遍表现不佳，提供外部知识（如原始文档）可以部分缓解幻觉问题，波斯语专门训练的LLM与其他模型在幻觉方面没有显著差异。

Conclusion: 波斯语LLM在幻觉检测方面存在明显挑战，需要进一步研究来改进低资源语言的幻觉缓解技术。

Abstract: Hallucination is a persistent issue affecting all large language Models
(LLMs), particularly within low-resource languages such as Persian.
PerHalluEval (Persian Hallucination Evaluation) is the first dynamic
hallucination evaluation benchmark tailored for the Persian language. Our
benchmark leverages a three-stage LLM-driven pipeline, augmented with human
validation, to generate plausible answers and summaries regarding QA and
summarization tasks, focusing on detecting extrinsic and intrinsic
hallucinations. Moreover, we used the log probabilities of generated tokens to
select the most believable hallucinated instances. In addition, we engaged
human annotators to highlight Persian-specific contexts in the QA dataset in
order to evaluate LLMs' performance on content specifically related to Persian
culture. Our evaluation of 12 LLMs, including open- and closed-source models
using PerHalluEval, revealed that the models generally struggle in detecting
hallucinated Persian text. We showed that providing external knowledge, i.e.,
the original document for the summarization task, could mitigate hallucination
partially. Furthermore, there was no significant difference in terms of
hallucination when comparing LLMs specifically trained for Persian with others.

*Junhyuk Choi,Ro-hoon Oh,Jihwan Seol,Bugeun Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: VoiceBBQ是BBQ数据集的语音扩展版本，用于评估语音语言模型在内容和声学两个方面的社会偏见。该数据集将BBQ上下文转换为受控语音条件，可测量准确性、偏见和一致性得分。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于语音的特性，语音语言模型的社会偏见可能来自内容方面和声学方面，需要专门的评估工具来诊断这两种偏见源。

Method: 将BBQ数据集的所有上下文转换为受控语音条件，创建VoiceBBQ数据集，用于评估语音语言模型在内容和声学偏见方面的表现。

Result: 评估了LLaMA-Omni和Qwen2-Audio两个模型：LLaMA-Omni抵抗声学偏见但放大性别和口音偏见；Qwen2-Audio显著减弱这些偏见线索同时保持内容保真度。

Conclusion: VoiceBBQ提供了一个紧凑的测试平台，可用于联合诊断语音语言模型的内容和声学偏见。

Abstract: We introduce VoiceBBQ, a spoken extension of the BBQ (Bias Benchmark for
Question Answering) - a dataset that measures social bias by presenting
ambiguous or disambiguated contexts followed by questions that may elicit
stereotypical responses. Due to the nature of speech, social bias in Spoken
Language Models (SLMs) can emerge from two distinct sources: 1) content aspect
and 2) acoustic aspect. The dataset converts every BBQ context into controlled
voice conditions, enabling per-axis accuracy, bias, and consistency scores that
remain comparable to the original text benchmark. Using VoiceBBQ, we evaluate
two SLMs - LLaMA-Omni and Qwen2-Audio - and observe architectural contrasts:
LLaMA-Omni resists acoustic bias while amplifying gender and accent bias,
whereas Qwen2-Audio substantially dampens these cues while preserving content
fidelity. VoiceBBQ thus provides a compact, drop-in testbed for jointly
diagnosing content and acoustic bias across spoken language models.

### [138] [Acoustic-based Gender Differentiation in Speech-aware Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21125)
*Junhyuk Choi,Jihwan Seol,Nayeon Kim,Chanhee Cho,EunBin Cho,Bugeun Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个用于分析语音语言模型中基于声学的性别差异的新数据集，发现LLaMA-Omni系列模型存在矛盾模式：在性别刻板印象问题上偏向男性回答，而在需要性别区分的情境中却给出性别无关的回答。这种偏见主要源于Whisper语音编码器生成的男性导向声学标记。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语音语言模型可能存在基于说话者性别的响应差异，即使问题相同。为了系统分析这一现象，需要专门的数据集和方法来评估模型中的性别偏见。

Method: 创建包含9,208个语音样本的数据集，分为性别无关、性别刻板印象和性别依赖三类问题。评估LLaMA-Omni系列模型，分析其在不同类别问题上的响应模式，并通过中性选项和性别中性化方法进行验证。

Result: 发现矛盾模式：在性别刻板印象问题上所有模型都表现出男性导向响应，而在需要性别区分的性别依赖问题上却给出性别无关响应。这种模式主要源于Whisper语音编码器的男性偏向。

Conclusion: 当前语音语言模型未能成功消除性别偏见，过分强调一般公平原则而忽视了情境适当性，需要更复杂的技术来正确处理语音技术中的性别信息。

Abstract: Speech-aware Language Models (SpeechLMs) have fundamentally transformed
human-AI interaction by enabling voice-based communication, yet they may
exhibit acoustic-based gender differentiation where identical questions lead to
different responses based on the speaker's gender. This paper propose a new
dataset that enables systematic analysis of this phenomenon, containing 9,208
speech samples across three categories: Gender-Independent,
Gender-Stereotypical, and Gender-Dependent. We further evaluated LLaMA-Omni
series and discovered a paradoxical pattern; while overall responses seems
identical regardless of gender, the pattern is far from unbiased responses.
Specifically, in Gender-Stereotypical questions, all models consistently
exhibited male-oriented responses; meanwhile, in Gender-Dependent questions
where gender differentiation would be contextually appropriate, models
exhibited responses independent to gender instead. We also confirm that this
pattern does not result from neutral options nor perceived gender of a voice.
When we allow neutral response, models tends to respond neutrally also in
Gender-Dependent questions. The paradoxical pattern yet retains when we applied
gender neutralization methods on speech. Through comparison between SpeechLMs
with corresponding backbone LLMs, we confirmed that these paradoxical patterns
primarily stem from Whisper speech encoders, which generates male-oriented
acoustic tokens. These findings reveal that current SpeechLMs may not
successfully remove gender biases though they prioritized general fairness
principles over contextual appropriateness, highlighting the need for more
sophisticated techniques to utilize gender information properly in speech
technology.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文研究发现LLM训练数据中存在句法模板与领域之间的虚假相关性，这种相关性会干扰模型对指令语义的理解，甚至可能被用于绕过安全微调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM需要理解任务指令的语义和领域，但句法也可能传递隐含信息。研究发现训练数据中句法模板与领域存在虚假相关性，可能影响模型性能。

Method: 使用合成训练数据集分析句法-领域相关性对OLMo-2模型的影响，建立评估框架检测该现象在FlanV2数据集和不同模型中的存在，并通过案例研究分析对安全微调的影响。

Result: 句法-领域相关性会降低OLMo-2模型在实体知识任务上的性能（平均0.51±0.06），在OLMo-2-7B、Llama-4-Maverick和GPT-4o等模型中均存在该现象，且可被用于绕过安全拒绝机制。

Conclusion: 需要显式测试句法-领域相关性，并确保训练数据中特别是领域内的句法多样性，以防止此类虚假相关性。

Abstract: For an LLM to correctly respond to an instruction it must understand both the
semantics and the domain (i.e., subject area) of a given task-instruction pair.
However, syntax can also convey implicit information Recent work shows that
syntactic templates--frequent sequences of Part-of-Speech (PoS) tags--are
prevalent in training data and often appear in model outputs. In this work we
characterize syntactic templates, domain, and semantics in task-instruction
pairs. We identify cases of spurious correlations between syntax and domain,
where models learn to associate a domain with syntax during training; this can
sometimes override prompt semantics. Using a synthetic training dataset, we
find that the syntactic-domain correlation can lower performance (mean 0.51 +/-
0.06) on entity knowledge tasks in OLMo-2 models (1B-13B). We introduce an
evaluation framework to detect this phenomenon in trained models, and show that
it occurs on a subset of the FlanV2 dataset in open (OLMo-2-7B;
Llama-4-Maverick), and closed (GPT-4o) models. Finally, we present a case study
on the implications for safety finetuning, showing that unintended
syntactic-domain correlations can be used to bypass refusals in OLMo-2-7B
Instruct and GPT-4o. Our findings highlight two needs: (1) to explicitly test
for syntactic-domain correlations, and (2) to ensure syntactic diversity in
training data, specifically within domains, to prevent such spurious
correlations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 幽默是人类的基本特质，其计算理解是NLP中最具挑战性的任务之一。幽默作为抽象、创造性且依赖语境的概念，需要大量推理能力来理解和创造，因此成为评估现代大语言模型常识知识和推理能力的合适任务。

Method: 本文采用文献综述的方法，系统梳理了计算幽默领域的研究现状，特别是关于幽默生成和解释的任务。

Result: 研究发现，尽管幽默理解具有基础NLP任务的所有特征，但超越双关语的幽默生成和解释研究仍然稀少，最先进的模型在幽默处理能力上仍远不及人类水平。

Conclusion: 作者强调了计算幽默处理作为NLP子学科的重要性，并就该领域未来研究方向进行了广泛讨论，特别考虑了幽默的主观性和伦理模糊性特点。

Abstract: The creation and perception of humour is a fundamental human trait,
positioning its computational understanding as one of the most challenging
tasks in natural language processing (NLP). As an abstract, creative, and
frequently context-dependent construct, humour requires extensive reasoning to
understand and create, making it a pertinent task for assessing the
common-sense knowledge and reasoning abilities of modern large language models
(LLMs). In this work, we survey the landscape of computational humour as it
pertains to the generative tasks of creation and explanation. We observe that,
despite the task of understanding humour bearing all the hallmarks of a
foundational NLP task, work on generating and explaining humour beyond puns
remains sparse, while state-of-the-art models continue to fall short of human
capabilities. We bookend our literature survey by motivating the importance of
computational humour processing as a subdiscipline of NLP and presenting an
extensive discussion of future directions for research in the area that takes
into account the subjective and ethically ambiguous nature of humour.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究探讨了基于小型语言模型（SLM）的聊天机器人的个人可识别信息（PII）泄露问题，提出了专门针对PII提取的贪婪坐标梯度方法（GEP），在复杂场景下实现了比传统模板方法高60倍的泄露检测效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着小型语言模型在某些领域表现出与大型语言模型相当的性能但消耗更少的能源和时间，其在下游任务中的PII泄露风险尚未被充分研究。

Method: 首先基于BioGPT微调了ChatBioGPT聊天机器人，然后提出了GEP方法——一种专门针对PII提取的贪婪坐标梯度方法，并在自由风格插入的复杂场景下进行测试。

Result: GEP方法相比传统模板方法泄露检测效果提升高达60倍，在自由风格插入的复杂场景下仍能达到4.53%的PII泄露率。

Conclusion: SLM存在显著的PII泄露风险，需要开发更有效的检测和防护方法，GEP为PII泄露检测提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Small language models (SLMs) become unprecedentedly appealing due to their
approximately equivalent performance compared to large language models (LLMs)
in certain fields with less energy and time consumption during training and
inference. However, the personally identifiable information (PII) leakage of
SLMs for downstream tasks has yet to be explored. In this study, we investigate
the PII leakage of the chatbot based on SLM. We first finetune a new chatbot,
i.e., ChatBioGPT based on the backbone of BioGPT using medical datasets Alpaca
and HealthCareMagic. It shows a matchable performance in BERTscore compared
with previous studies of ChatDoctor and ChatGPT. Based on this model, we prove
that the previous template-based PII attacking methods cannot effectively
extract the PII in the dataset for leakage detection under the SLM condition.
We then propose GEP, which is a greedy coordinate gradient-based (GCG) method
specifically designed for PII extraction. We conduct experimental studies of
GEP and the results show an increment of up to 60$\times$ more leakage compared
with the previous template-based methods. We further expand the capability of
GEP in the case of a more complicated and realistic situation by conducting
free-style insertion where the inserted PII in the dataset is in the form of
various syntactic expressions instead of fixed templates, and GEP is still able
to reveal a PII leakage rate of up to 4.53%.

Motivation: 解决LLMs在科学推理中的两个主要瓶颈：显式检索会打断推理过程并带来额外开销，多智能体管道会稀释强解决方案

Method: 使用Monitor-based检索模块在token级别集成外部知识，结合分层解决方案精炼（HSR）和质量感知迭代推理（QAIR）机制

Result: 在Humanity's Last Exam Bio/Chem Gold上达到48.3%准确率，比最强基线提升13.4个百分点，同时减少53.5%的token使用和43.7%的步骤

Conclusion: 隐式增强和结构化精炼能够克服显式工具使用和统一聚合的低效性，错误分析显示推理失败和知识缺口在85%情况下同时出现

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently shown strong progress on
scientific reasoning, yet two major bottlenecks remain. First, explicit
retrieval fragments reasoning, imposing a hidden "tool tax" of extra tokens and
steps. Second, multi-agent pipelines often dilute strong solutions by averaging
across all candidates. We address these challenges with a unified framework
that combines implicit retrieval and structured collaboration. At its
foundation, a Monitor-based retrieval module operates at the token level,
integrating external knowledge with minimal disruption to reasoning. On top of
this substrate, Hierarchical Solution Refinement (HSR) iteratively designates
each candidate as an anchor to be repaired by its peers, while Quality-Aware
Iterative Reasoning (QAIR) adapts refinement to solution quality. On Humanity's
Last Exam (HLE) Bio/Chem Gold, our framework achieves 48.3\% accuracy -- the
highest reported to date, surpassing the strongest agent baseline by 13.4
points and leading frontier LLMs by up to 18.1 points, while simultaneously
reducing token usage by 53.5\% and agent steps by 43.7\%. Results on SuperGPQA
and TRQA confirm robustness across domains. Error analysis shows that reasoning
failures and knowledge gaps co-occur in over 85\% of cases, while diversity
analysis reveals a clear dichotomy: retrieval tasks benefit from solution
variety, whereas reasoning tasks favor consensus. Together, these findings
demonstrate how implicit augmentation and structured refinement overcome the
inefficiencies of explicit tool use and uniform aggregation. Code is available

TL;DR: 本文介绍了CLaw基准，用于评估LLMs在中国法律知识及其推理应用方面的表现，发现当前LLMs在准确复述法律条文方面存在显著困难。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在法律文本分析和引用相关法规方面的可靠性受到通用预训练的限制，需要专门的法律知识评估基准。

Method: 构建包含306部中国国家法规的细粒度语料库（64,849条目）和254个基于案例的推理实例，用于评估LLMs的法律知识检索和推理能力。

Result: 实证评估显示大多数当代LLMs难以准确复述法律条文，这严重影响了其法律推理的可靠性。

Conclusion: 实现可信赖的法律推理需要准确的知识检索（通过SFT或RAG增强）与强大的一般推理能力的协同作用。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly tasked with analyzing legal
texts and citing relevant statutes, yet their reliability is often compromised
by general pre-training that ingests legal texts without specialized focus,
obscuring the true depth of their legal knowledge. This paper introduces CLaw,
a novel benchmark specifically engineered to meticulously evaluate LLMs on
Chinese legal knowledge and its application in reasoning. CLaw comprises two
key components: (1) a comprehensive, fine-grained corpus of all 306 Chinese
national statutes, segmented to the subparagraph level and incorporating
precise historical revision timesteps for rigorous recall evaluation (64,849
entries), and (2) a challenging set of 254 case-based reasoning instances
derived from China Supreme Court curated materials to assess the practical
application of legal knowledge. Our empirical evaluation reveals that most
contemporary LLMs significantly struggle to faithfully reproduce legal
provisions. As accurate retrieval and citation of legal provisions form the
basis of legal reasoning, this deficiency critically undermines the reliability
of their responses. We contend that achieving trustworthy legal reasoning in
LLMs requires a robust synergy of accurate knowledge retrieval--potentially
enhanced through supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG)--and strong general reasoning capabilities. This work provides an
essential benchmark and critical insights for advancing domain-specific LLM
reasoning, particularly within the complex legal sphere.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 同音异义词（拼写相同但含义不同的词）对生成模型构成挑战，扩散模型在处理含同音异义词的提示时可能同时生成该词的多个含义，即同音异义词重复问题。这个问题因英语中心偏见而更加复杂，即使原始语言中不是同音异义词的词在翻译成英语后也可能变成同音异义词而失去原意。

Method: 引入测量重复率的方法，使用视觉语言模型（VLM）进行自动评估和人工评估，研究通过提示扩展来缓解同音异义词重复问题。

Result: 展示了不同扩散模型的评估结果，证明提示扩展方法能有效减少同音异义词重复问题，包括由英语中心偏见引起的重复。

Conclusion: 提出的自动评估管道代码已公开可用，提示扩展是缓解同音异义词重复问题的有效方法，尤其对处理英语中心偏见带来的翻译后同音异义问题有显著效果。

Abstract: Homonyms are words with identical spelling but distinct meanings, which pose
challenges for many generative models. When a homonym appears in a prompt,
diffusion models may generate multiple senses of the word simultaneously, which
is known as homonym duplication. This issue is further complicated by an
Anglocentric bias, which includes an additional translation step before the
text-to-image model pipeline. As a result, even words that are not homonymous
in the original language may become homonyms and lose their meaning after
translation into English. In this paper, we introduce a method for measuring
duplication rates and conduct evaluations of different diffusion models using
both automatic evaluation utilizing Vision-Language Models (VLM) and human
evaluation. Additionally, we investigate methods to mitigate the homonym
duplication problem through prompt expansion, demonstrating that this approach
also effectively reduces duplication related to Anglocentric bias. The code for
the automatic evaluation pipeline is publicly available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究在处理输出同质化问题时往往未能以任务依赖的方式概念化多样性，不同任务对同质化的定义和期望各不相同。

Method: 提出了包含八个任务类别的分类法，引入任务锚定功能多样性评估方法，并开发任务锚定采样技术来增加功能多样性。

Result: 成功提高了功能多样性，同时保持了响应质量，挑战了多样性-质量权衡的传统认知。

Conclusion: 任务依赖的方法能够有效改进输出同质化的评估和缓解策略。

Abstract: A large language model can be less helpful if it exhibits output response
homogenization. But whether two responses are considered homogeneous, and
whether such homogenization is problematic, both depend on the task category.
For instance, in objective math tasks, we often expect no variation in the
final answer but anticipate variation in the problem-solving strategy. Whereas,
for creative writing tasks, we may expect variation in key narrative components
(e.g. plot, genre, setting, etc), beyond the vocabulary or embedding diversity
produced by temperature-sampling. Previous work addressing output
homogenization often fails to conceptualize diversity in a task-dependent way.
We address this gap in the literature directly by making the following
contributions. (1) We present a task taxonomy comprised of eight task
categories that each have distinct conceptualizations of output homogenization.
(2) We introduce task-anchored functional diversity to better evaluate output
homogenization. (3) We propose a task-anchored sampling technique that
increases functional diversity for task categories where homogenization is
undesired, while preserving homogenization where it is desired. (4) We
challenge the perceived existence of a diversity-quality trade-off by
increasing functional diversity while maintaining response quality. Overall, we
demonstrate how task dependence improves the evaluation and mitigation of

TL;DR: LLMTrace是一个新的大规模双语（英语和俄语）语料库，用于AI生成文本检测，支持全文二元分类和AI生成区间检测任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有检测系统面临训练数据不足的问题：数据集通常由过时模型生成、主要是英语、且缺乏混合人机写作场景和字符级标注。

Method: 使用多样化的现代专有和开源LLM构建数据集，提供字符级标注以支持AI生成区间的精确定位。

Result: 开发了LLMTrace语料库，支持传统全文分类和新的AI生成区间检测任务。

Conclusion: LLMTrace将成为训练和评估下一代更细致、更实用的AI检测模型的重要资源。

Abstract: The widespread use of human-like text from Large Language Models (LLMs)
necessitates the development of robust detection systems. However, progress is
limited by a critical lack of suitable training data; existing datasets are
often generated with outdated models, are predominantly in English, and fail to
address the increasingly common scenario of mixed human-AI authorship.
Crucially, while some datasets address mixed authorship, none provide the
character-level annotations required for the precise localization of
AI-generated segments within a text. To address these gaps, we introduce
LLMTrace, a new large-scale, bilingual (English and Russian) corpus for
AI-generated text detection. Constructed using a diverse range of modern
proprietary and open-source LLMs, our dataset is designed to support two key
tasks: traditional full-text binary classification (human vs. AI) and the novel
task of AI-generated interval detection, facilitated by character-level
annotations. We believe LLMTrace will serve as a vital resource for training
and evaluating the next generation of more nuanced and practical AI detection
models. The project page is available at

TL;DR: 本文理论分析了输入扰动对思维链输出的影响，推导了输出波动可接受范围内的输入扰动上界，并证明该上界与推理步骤数正相关，且无限长推理过程无法消除输入扰动影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究表明思维链输出受输入扰动显著影响，但缺乏理论解释这种影响如何传播，这限制了提示优化方法的进一步改进。

Method: 首先推导输出波动可接受范围内的输入扰动上界，然后在线性自注意力模型上验证理论分析，最后在三个主流数据集和四个主流模型上进行实验验证。

Result: 理论分析表明：1）输入扰动上界与推理步骤数正相关；2）无限长推理无法消除输入扰动影响；3）在线性自注意力模型中，上界与输入嵌入和隐藏状态向量的范数负相关。实验结果与理论分析一致。

Conclusion: 本文为输入扰动对思维链输出的影响提供了理论解释，揭示了扰动传播机制，为改进提示优化方法提供了理论基础。

Abstract: Existing research indicates that the output of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) is
significantly affected by input perturbations. Although many methods aim to
mitigate such impact by optimizing prompts, a theoretical explanation of how
these perturbations influence CoT outputs remains an open area of research.
This gap limits our in-depth understanding of how input perturbations propagate
during the reasoning process and hinders further improvements in prompt
optimization methods. Therefore, in this paper, we theoretically analyze the
effect of input perturbations on the fluctuation of CoT outputs. We first
derive an upper bound for input perturbations under the condition that the
output fluctuation is within an acceptable range, based on which we prove that:
(i) This upper bound is positively correlated with the number of reasoning
steps in the CoT; (ii) Even an infinitely long reasoning process cannot
eliminate the impact of input perturbations. We then apply these conclusions to
the Linear Self-Attention (LSA) model, which can be viewed as a simplified
version of the Transformer. For the LSA model, we prove that the upper bound
for input perturbation is negatively correlated with the norms of the input
embedding and hidden state vectors. To validate this theoretical analysis, we
conduct experiments on three mainstream datasets and four mainstream models.
The experimental results align with our theoretical analysis, empirically
demonstrating the correctness of our findings.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DisCoCLIP是一个结合了冻结CLIP视觉变换器和新型张量网络文本编码器的多模态编码器，通过显式编码句法结构来改进视觉语言模型的组合推理能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉语言模型在大规模图像文本对齐方面表现出色，但往往忽略了语言的组合结构，导致在依赖词序和谓词-论元结构的任务上表现不佳

Method: 使用组合范畴语法解析器解析句子生成分布词张量，通过张量分解降低参数数量，采用自监督对比损失进行端到端训练

Result: 显著提高了对动词语义和词序的敏感性：将CLIP的SVO-Probes动词准确率从77.6%提升到82.4%，ARO归因和关系分数分别提升超过9%和4%，在新引入的SVO-Swap基准上达到93.7%

Conclusion: 通过张量网络嵌入显式语言结构可以产生可解释、参数高效的表示，显著改善视觉语言任务中的组合推理能力

Abstract: Recent vision-language models excel at large-scale image-text alignment but
often neglect the compositional structure of language, leading to failures on
tasks that hinge on word order and predicate-argument structure. We introduce
DisCoCLIP, a multimodal encoder that combines a frozen CLIP vision transformer
with a novel tensor network text encoder that explicitly encodes syntactic
structure. Sentences are parsed with a Combinatory Categorial Grammar parser to
yield distributional word tensors whose contractions mirror the sentence's
grammatical derivation. To keep the model efficient, high-order tensors are
factorized with tensor decompositions, reducing parameter count from tens of
millions to under one million. Trained end-to-end with a self-supervised
contrastive loss, DisCoCLIP markedly improves sensitivity to verb semantics and
word order: it raises CLIP's SVO-Probes verb accuracy from 77.6% to 82.4%,
boosts ARO attribution and relation scores by over 9% and 4%, and achieves
93.7% on a newly introduced SVO-Swap benchmark. These results demonstrate that
embedding explicit linguistic structure via tensor networks yields
interpretable, parameter-efficient representations that substantially improve
compositional reasoning in vision-language tasks.

TL;DR: 本文提出了Updesh数据集，这是一个针对13种印度语言的大规模合成指令跟随数据集，通过基于维基百科内容的语言特定数据生成策略，旨在解决多语言AI系统在低资源语言中的文化接地问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发在多语言环境下有效运作且文化接地的AI系统是一个长期挑战，特别是在低资源语言环境中。合成数据是一个有前景的途径，但其在多语言和多元文化背景下的有效性尚未充分探索。

Method: 采用自下而上的生成策略，使用大型开源LLM（≥235B参数）基于语言特定的维基百科内容生成文化语境化的合成数据。这种方法补充了从高资源语言（如英语）翻译合成数据集的主流自上而下范式。

Result: 创建的Updesh数据集包含950万个数据点，涵盖13种印度语言。通过自动指标和人工评估（10,000次评估）显示生成数据质量高，但人工评估也指出了需要改进的领域。在下游评估中，使用Updesh微调的模型在生成任务上取得显著提升，在多项选择式NLU任务上保持竞争力，特别是在低和中资源语言中改进最为明显。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，有效的多语言AI需要结合上下文感知、文化接地方法的多方面数据策展和生成策略。在低和中资源语言中的相对改进最为显著，缩小了它们与高资源语言之间的差距。

Abstract: Developing AI systems that operate effectively across languages while
remaining culturally grounded is a long-standing challenge, particularly in
low-resource settings. Synthetic data provides a promising avenue, yet its
effectiveness in multilingual and multicultural contexts remains underexplored.
We investigate the creation and impact of synthetic, culturally contextualized
datasets for Indian languages through a bottom-up generation strategy that
prompts large open-source LLMs (>= 235B parameters) to ground data generation
in language-specific Wikipedia content. This approach complements the dominant
top-down paradigm of translating synthetic datasets from high-resource
languages such as English. We introduce Updesh, a high-quality large-scale
synthetic instruction-following dataset comprising 9.5M data points across 13
Indian languages, encompassing diverse reasoning and generative tasks with an
emphasis on long-context, multi-turn capabilities, and alignment with Indian
cultural contexts. A comprehensive evaluation incorporating both automated
metrics and human annotation across 10k assessments indicates that generated
data is high quality; though, human evaluation highlights areas for further
improvement. Additionally, we perform downstream evaluations by fine-tuning
models on our dataset and assessing the performance across 15 diverse
multilingual datasets. Models trained on Updesh consistently achieve
significant gains on generative tasks and remain competitive on multiple-choice
style NLU tasks. Notably, relative improvements are most pronounced in low and
medium-resource languages, narrowing their gap with high-resource languages.
These findings provide empirical evidence that effective multilingual AI
requires multi-faceted data curation and generation strategies that incorporate
context-aware, culturally grounded methodologies.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究发现大语言模型中的谄媚行为可分为谄媚性同意和谄媚性赞美，与真诚同意在潜在空间中沿不同线性方向编码，且可独立调控。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型经常表现出谄媚行为（如过度同意或奉承用户），但尚不清楚这些行为是源于单一机制还是多个不同过程。

Method: 使用均值差异方向、激活添加和子空间几何方法，在多个模型和数据集上分析谄媚行为的表示结构。

Result: 三种行为在潜在空间中沿不同线性方向编码；每种行为可独立增强或抑制而不影响其他行为；表示结构在不同模型家族和规模中保持一致。

Conclusion: 谄媚行为对应着不同的、可独立调控的表示，表明它们具有独立的神经机制。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often exhibit sycophantic behaviors -- such as
excessive agreement with or flattery of the user -- but it is unclear whether
these behaviors arise from a single mechanism or multiple distinct processes.
We decompose sycophancy into sycophantic agreement and sycophantic praise,
contrasting both with genuine agreement. Using difference-in-means directions,
activation additions, and subspace geometry across multiple models and
datasets, we show that: (1) the three behaviors are encoded along distinct
linear directions in latent space; (2) each behavior can be independently
amplified or suppressed without affecting the others; and (3) their
representational structure is consistent across model families and scales.
These results suggest that sycophantic behaviors correspond to distinct,
independently steerable representations.

TL;DR: RLBFF结合了RLHF的人类偏好灵活性和RLVR的规则验证精确性，通过将自然语言反馈转化为可二元判断的原则来训练奖励模型，在多个基准测试中达到最优性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决RLHF缺乏可解释性和易受奖励攻击的问题，以及RLVR局限于正确性验证的不足，提出一种能捕捉响应质量细微差别的新方法。

Method: 从自然语言反馈中提取可二元判断的原则（如信息准确性、代码可读性），将奖励模型训练构建为蕴含任务（响应是否满足任意原则）。

Result: 在RM-Bench上达到86.2%，JudgeBench上达到81.4%（截至2025年9月24日排行榜第一），对齐Qwen3-32B模型在MT-Bench、WildBench和Arena Hard v2上匹配或超越o3-mini和DeepSeek R1性能，推理成本不到5%。

Conclusion: RLBFF提供了一种开放源码的对齐方法，结合了人类反馈的灵活性和规则验证的精确性，在保持高性能的同时显著降低了成本。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) and Reinforcement Learning
with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) are the main RL paradigms used in LLM
post-training, each offering distinct advantages. However, RLHF struggles with
interpretability and reward hacking because it relies on human judgments that
usually lack explicit criteria, whereas RLVR is limited in scope by its focus
on correctness-based verifiers. We propose Reinforcement Learning with Binary
Flexible Feedback (RLBFF), which combines the versatility of human-driven
preferences with the precision of rule-based verification, enabling reward
models to capture nuanced aspects of response quality beyond mere correctness.
RLBFF extracts principles that can be answered in a binary fashion (e.g.
accuracy of information: yes, or code readability: no) from natural language
feedback. Such principles can then be used to ground Reward Model training as
an entailment task (response satisfies or does not satisfy an arbitrary
principle). We show that Reward Models trained in this manner can outperform
Bradley-Terry models when matched for data and achieve top performance on
RM-Bench (86.2%) and JudgeBench (81.4%, #1 on leaderboard as of September 24,
2025). Additionally, users can specify principles of interest at inference time
to customize the focus of our reward models, in contrast to Bradley-Terry
models. Finally, we present a fully open source recipe (including data) to
align Qwen3-32B using RLBFF and our Reward Model, to match or exceed the
performance of o3-mini and DeepSeek R1 on general alignment benchmarks of
MT-Bench, WildBench, and Arena Hard v2 (at <5% of the inference cost).

Motivation: 多面体博弈（如Colonel Blotto和拥塞博弈）具有指数级大的动作空间，现有方法在部分信息设置下学习粗相关均衡的计算复杂度不理想且不实用。

Method: 构建基于核化范式的框架，应用于Colonel Blotto、图拟阵和网络拥塞等多面体博弈，开发基于收益的学习算法。

Result: 提出的算法在计算效率上显著优于现有方法，实现了多面体博弈中粗相关均衡的高效学习。

Conclusion: 该框架为部分信息设置下的多面体博弈提供了实用的粗相关均衡学习解决方案，解决了现有方法的计算效率瓶颈。

Abstract: We examine the problem of efficiently learning coarse correlated equilibria
(CCE) in polyhedral games, that is, normal-form games with an exponentially
large number of actions per player and an underlying combinatorial structure.
Prominent examples of such games are the classical Colonel Blotto and
congestion games. To achieve computational efficiency, the learning algorithms
must exhibit regret and per-iteration complexity that scale polylogarithmically
in the size of the players' action sets. This challenge has recently been
addressed in the full-information setting, primarily through the use of
kernelization. However, in the case of the realistic, but mathematically
challenging, partial-information setting, existing approaches result in
suboptimal and impractical runtime complexity to learn CCE. We tackle this
limitation by building a framework based on the kernelization paradigm. We
apply this framework to prominent examples of polyhedral games -- namely the
Colonel Blotto, graphic matroid and network congestion games -- and provide
computationally efficient payoff-based learning algorithms, which significantly
improve upon prior works in terms of the runtime for learning CCE in these
settings.

Motivation: 在现实应用中，由于计算复杂性或输入不确定性，精确的最优决策往往难以获得，因此需要研究近似最优决策的理论框架。

Method: 首先使用选择函数建立近似均衡的简单鲁棒模型，分析其代数性质和组合结构；然后将该方法扩展到更高级的开放博弈模型。

Result: 成功开发了基于范畴论的近似博弈论框架，建立了选择函数和开放博弈的近似理论体系。

Conclusion: 范畴论为近似博弈论提供了有力的数学工具，能够有效处理多智能体系统中的近似决策问题。

Abstract: This paper uses category theory to develop an entirely new approach to
approximate game theory. Game theory is the study of how different agents
within a multi-agent system take decisions. At its core, game theory asks what
an optimal decision is in a given scenario. Thus approximate game theory asks
what is an approximately optimal decision in a given scenario. This is
important in practice as -- just like in much of computing -- exact answers
maybe too difficult to compute or even impossible to compute given inherent
uncertainty in input.
  We consider first "Selection Functions" which are functions and develop a
simple yet robust model of approximate equilibria. We develop the algebraic
properties of approximation wrt selection functions and also relate
approximation to the compositional structure of selection functions. We then
repeat this process successfully for Open Games -- a more advanced model of
game theory.

and scoring strategies, and efficient batch processing. It also includes robust
support for working with LLM APIs, featuring retry logic, result caching,
detailed cost tracking, and comprehensive configuration management. We showcase
DELM's capabilities through two case studies: one featuring a novel prompt
optimization algorithm, and another illustrating how DELM quantifies trade-offs
between cost and coverage when selecting keywords to decide which paragraphs to

the VLM to generate structured inferences, including chronological,
geographical, and cultural attributions, alongside interpretive justifications.
We evaluate the system on a set of Eastern Eurasian Bronze Age artifacts from

Motivation: 研究旨在评估信息检索方法性能测量的准确性和鲁棒性，特别关注依赖随机种子的机器学习方法（如transformer模型）的性能稳定性问题。

Method: 使用三种不同的IR任务，通过随机种子变化来检验传统统计学习模型和基于transformer的学习模型的性能变化，采用bootstrap测试集和随机种子集来估计性能变异。

Result: 统计模型表现稳定，而transformer模型在种子变化时显示出巨大变异：11个案例中有9个的F1分数标准差超过0.075，11个精度值中有7个的标准差超过0.125。

Conclusion: 研究结果突显了transformer模型对训练不稳定的脆弱性，质疑了先前结果的可靠性，强调需要更严格的评估实践。

Abstract: A range of approaches have been proposed for estimating the accuracy or
robustness of the measured performance of IR methods. One is to use
bootstrapping of test sets, which, as we confirm, provides an estimate of
variation in performance. For IR methods that rely on a seed, such as those
that involve machine learning, another approach is to use a random set of seeds
to examine performance variation. Using three different IR tasks we have used
such randomness to examine a range of traditional statistical learning models
and transformer-based learning models. While the statistical models are stable,
the transformer models show huge variation as seeds are changed. In 9 of 11
cases the F1-scores (in the range 0.0--1.0) had a standard deviation of over
0.075; while 7 of 11 precision values (also in the range 0.0--1.0) had a
standard deviation of over 0.125. This is in a context where differences of
less than 0.02 have been used as evidence of method improvement. Our findings
highlight the vulnerability of transformer models to training instabilities and
moreover raise questions about the reliability of previous results, thus
underscoring the need for rigorous evaluation practices.

retrieval (GR) due to their meaningful semantic discriminability. However,
current research on SIDs faces three main challenges: (1) the absence of
large-scale public datasets with multimodal features, (2) limited investigation
into optimization strategies for SID generation, which typically rely on costly
GR training for evaluation, and (3) slow online convergence in industrial
deployment. To address these challenges, we propose FORGE, a comprehensive
benchmark for FOrming semantic identifieR in Generative rEtrieval with
industrial datasets. Specifically, FORGE is equipped with a dataset comprising
14 billion user interactions and multimodal features of 250 million items
sampled from Taobao, one of the biggest e-commerce platforms in China.
Leveraging this dataset, FORGE explores several optimizations to enhance the
SID construction and validates their effectiveness via offline experiments
across different settings and tasks. Further online analysis conducted on our
platform, which serves over 300 million users daily, reveals a 0.35% increase
in transaction count, highlighting the practical impact of our method.
Regarding the expensive SID validation accompanied by the full training of GRs,
we propose two novel metrics of SID that correlate positively with
recommendation performance, enabling convenient evaluations without any GR
training. For real-world applications, FORGE introduces an offline pretraining
schema that reduces online convergence by half. The code and data are available

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 该论文研究了从购物评论网站提取产品信息以构建最新产品数据库的问题，提出了MarkupLM++模型，通过扩展DOM树内部节点的预测来提高信息提取效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Web信息提取(WIE)是电子商务系统的重要组成部分，支持客户分析和产品推荐等任务。需要从购物评论网站提取详细信息来构建最新的产品数据库。

Method: 在从不同规模的评论网站收集的产品数据上微调MarkupLM，然后开发了MarkupLM++变体，将预测扩展到DOM树的内部节点。

Result: 实验表明，使用更大更多样化的训练集总体上提高了提取准确性。包含内部节点有助于某些产品属性，但导致整体性能略有下降。最终模型达到精度0.906、召回率0.724和F1分数0.805。

Conclusion: 更大更多样化的训练数据有助于提高Web信息提取性能，而DOM树内部节点的包含策略需要根据具体应用场景进行权衡。

Abstract: Web information extraction (WIE) is an important part of many e-commerce
systems, supporting tasks like customer analysis and product recommendation. In
this work, we look at the problem of building up-to-date product databases by
extracting detailed information from shopping review websites. We fine-tuned
MarkupLM on product data gathered from review sites of different sizes and then
developed a variant we call MarkupLM++, which extends predictions to internal
nodes of the DOM tree. Our experiments show that using larger and more diverse
training sets improves extraction accuracy overall. We also find that including
internal nodes helps with some product attributes, although it leads to a
slight drop in overall performance. The final model reached a precision of
0.906, recall of 0.724, and an F1 score of 0.805.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 本文分析了推荐系统中知识蒸馏的交叉熵损失，揭示了CE损失与NDCG的联系，并提出RCE-KD方法来解决教师模型和学生模型top物品不一致的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 推荐系统中的知识蒸馏主要关注对最可能被偏好的物品进行排序蒸馏，但只能在物品子集上计算。研究发现当在物品子集上进行KD时，最小化CE损失只能在一定条件下最大化NDCG的下界，这与实际蒸馏教师模型top物品排序的目标存在矛盾。

Method: 提出RCE-KD方法：将教师模型给出的top物品根据学生模型的排序分为两个子集，对于不符合条件的子集，设计采样策略利用师生协作来近似闭包假设，并自适应地结合两个子集上的损失。

Result: 大量实验证明了该方法的有效性，代码已开源。

Conclusion: RCE-KD方法成功解决了推荐系统知识蒸馏中教师和学生模型top物品不一致的问题，为CE损失在KD中的应用提供了更好的理论支持和实践效果。

Abstract: This paper analyzes Cross-Entropy (CE) loss in knowledge distillation (KD)
for recommender systems. KD for recommender systems targets at distilling
rankings, especially among items most likely to be preferred, and can only be
computed on a small subset of items. Considering these features, we reveal the
connection between CE loss and NDCG in the field of KD. We prove that when
performing KD on an item subset, minimizing CE loss maximizes the lower bound
of NDCG, only if an assumption of closure is satisfied. It requires that the
item subset consists of the student's top items. However, this contradicts our
goal of distilling rankings of the teacher's top items. We empirically
demonstrate the vast gap between these two kinds of top items. To bridge the
gap between our goal and theoretical support, we propose Rejuvenated
Cross-Entropy for Knowledge Distillation (RCE-KD). It splits the top items
given by the teacher into two subsets based on whether they are highly ranked
by the student. For the subset that defies the condition, a sampling strategy
is devised to use teacher-student collaboration to approximate our assumption
of closure. We also combine the losses on the two subsets adaptively. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Our code is available
at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/RCE-KD.

TL;DR: IntSR是一个集成搜索和推荐的生成式框架，通过不同的查询模式统一处理这两种任务，解决了集成S&R行为带来的计算复杂度增加和动态语料库引入的错误模式学习问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有系统主要关注检索和排名的统一，但忽视了搜索和推荐任务的集成。搜索使用显式用户请求，而推荐依赖隐式用户兴趣，查询是区分两者的核心要素。

Method: 提出IntSR框架，使用不同的查询模式集成搜索和推荐任务，解决集成S&R行为的计算复杂度问题和动态语料库带来的错误模式学习。

Result: 在Amap多个场景中成功部署，数字资产GMV提升3.02%，POI推荐CTR提升2.76%，出行方式建议ACC提升5.13%。

Conclusion: IntSR通过查询作为核心元素，有效集成了搜索和推荐任务，在实际应用中取得了显著效果提升。

Abstract: Generative recommendation has emerged as a promising paradigm, demonstrating
remarkable results in both academic benchmarks and industrial applications.
However, existing systems predominantly focus on unifying retrieval and ranking
while neglecting the integration of search and recommendation (S&R) tasks. What
makes search and recommendation different is how queries are formed: search
uses explicit user requests, while recommendation relies on implicit user
interests. As for retrieval versus ranking, the distinction comes down to
whether the queries are the target items themselves. Recognizing the query as
central element, we propose IntSR, an integrated generative framework for S&R.
IntSR integrates these disparate tasks using distinct query modalities. It also
addresses the increased computational complexity associated with integrated S&R
behaviors and the erroneous pattern learning introduced by a dynamically
changing corpus. IntSR has been successfully deployed across various scenarios
in Amap, leading to substantial improvements in digital asset's GMV(+3.02%),
POI recommendation's CTR(+2.76%), and travel mode suggestion's ACC(+5.13%).

TL;DR: 本文提出了交互式推荐流（IRF）新范式，通过自然语言命令让用户主动控制推荐策略，解决传统推荐系统被动反馈机制无法捕捉用户细微行为动机的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统推荐系统依赖被动反馈机制，只能获取粗粒度的喜欢/不喜欢信号，无法捕捉用户细微的行为动机和意图，也无法识别具体哪些物品属性驱动用户满意或不满意，导致偏好建模不准确，造成用户意图与系统解释之间的差距。

Method: 开发了RecBot双智能体架构：解析器智能体将语言表达转换为结构化偏好，规划器智能体动态编排自适应工具链进行实时策略调整。采用模拟增强的知识蒸馏方法实现高效部署。

Result: 通过大量离线和长期在线实验，RecBot在用户满意度和业务成果方面均显示出显著改进。

Conclusion: 交互式推荐流（IRF）通过自然语言交互实现了用户对推荐策略的主动控制，有效解决了传统推荐系统的局限性，提升了推荐系统的准确性和用户满意度。

Abstract: Traditional recommender systems rely on passive feedback mechanisms that
limit users to simple choices such as like and dislike. However, these
coarse-grained signals fail to capture users' nuanced behavior motivations and
intentions. In turn, current systems cannot also distinguish which specific
item attributes drive user satisfaction or dissatisfaction, resulting in
inaccurate preference modeling. These fundamental limitations create a
persistent gap between user intentions and system interpretations, ultimately
undermining user satisfaction and harming system effectiveness.
  To address these limitations, we introduce the Interactive Recommendation
Feed (IRF), a pioneering paradigm that enables natural language commands within
mainstream recommendation feeds. Unlike traditional systems that confine users
to passive implicit behavioral influence, IRF empowers active explicit control
over recommendation policies through real-time linguistic commands. To support
this paradigm, we develop RecBot, a dual-agent architecture where a Parser
Agent transforms linguistic expressions into structured preferences and a
Planner Agent dynamically orchestrates adaptive tool chains for on-the-fly
policy adjustment. To enable practical deployment, we employ
simulation-augmented knowledge distillation to achieve efficient performance
while maintaining strong reasoning capabilities. Through extensive offline and
long-term online experiments, RecBot shows significant improvements in both
user satisfaction and business outcomes.

Building upon least action principles from physics, we derive classic learning
algorithms, Bellman's optimality equation in reinforcement learning, and the
Adam optimizer in generative models from first principles, i.e., the Learning

in the Lagrangian, and learning algorithms are derivable by seeking the
stationary trajectories.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然生成流网络使用流匹配损失来学习生成对象的随机策略，但目前缺乏多智能体生成流网络的理论框架，无法支持多个智能体协作生成对象。

Method: 提出了MA-GFlowNets理论框架，设计了四种算法：集中式流网络（集中训练）、独立流网络（分布式执行）、联合流网络（集中训练+分布式执行）及其条件版本。联合流训练基于局部-全局原则，将局部GFN集合作为全局GFN进行训练。

Result: 实验结果表明，所提出的框架在性能上优于强化学习和基于MCMC的方法。

Conclusion: MA-GFlowNets框架为多智能体协作生成提供了理论基础和有效算法，通过局部-全局原则确保了分布式策略生成样本的概率与奖励函数成正比。

Abstract: Generative flow networks utilize a flow-matching loss to learn a stochastic
policy for generating objects from a sequence of actions, such that the
probability of generating a pattern can be proportional to the corresponding
given reward. However, a theoretical framework for multi-agent generative flow
networks (MA-GFlowNets) has not yet been proposed. In this paper, we propose
the theory framework of MA-GFlowNets, which can be applied to multiple agents
to generate objects collaboratively through a series of joint actions. We
further propose four algorithms: a centralized flow network for centralized
training of MA-GFlowNets, an independent flow network for decentralized
execution, a joint flow network for achieving centralized training with
decentralized execution, and its updated conditional version. Joint Flow
training is based on a local-global principle allowing to train a collection of
(local) GFN as a unique (global) GFN. This principle provides a loss of
reasonable complexity and allows to leverage usual results on GFN to provide
theoretical guarantees that the independent policies generate samples with
probability proportional to the reward function. Experimental results
demonstrate the superiority of the proposed framework compared to reinforcement
learning and MCMC-based methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FastEagle是一种非自回归级联草稿器，通过单次前向传播生成整个草稿，替代了传统草稿器需要N次顺序传递的方法，实现了无损失LLM推理加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的草稿器（如EAGLE）需要N次顺序传递来提出N个token，限制了推理速度。FastEagle旨在通过消除草稿过程中的顺序依赖性来加速LLM推理。

Method: FastEagle采用非自回归级联草稿器设计，用轻量级层级级联替代时间步骤，并通过层级监督训练来减轻错误累积。结合约束草稿树保持无损失验证成本。

Result: 在多个LLM（Vicuna-13B、LLaMA-Instruct 3.x、DeepSeek-R1-Distill-LLaMA）和任务（MT-Bench、HumanEval等）上，FastEagle在贪婪和随机解码下均优于EAGLE-3，速度提升显著，同时保持可比较的平均接受长度。

Conclusion: 消除草稿中的顺序依赖性是实现无损失LLM推理加速的实用路径，FastEagle证明了这一方法的有效性。

Abstract: Speculative decoding accelerates generation by drafting candidates and
verifying them in parallel, yet state-of-the-art drafters (e.g., EAGLE) still
require N sequential passes to propose N tokens. We present FastEagle, a
non-autoregressive cascaded drafter that emits an entire draft in a single
forward pass. FastEagle replaces temporal steps with a lightweight layer
cascade and trains with layer-wise supervision to mitigate error accumulation.
Coupled with a constrained draft tree that preserves lossless verification
cost, FastEagle delivers substantial wall-clock speedups over strong
autoregressive drafters while maintaining competitive acceptance behavior.
Across multiple LLMs (Vicuna-13B, LLaMA-Instruct 3.x, and
DeepSeek-R1-Distill-LLaMA) and tasks (MT-Bench, HumanEval, GSM8K, CNN/DM,
Alpaca), FastEagle consistently outperforms EAGLE-3 in speedup under both
greedy and stochastic decoding, with comparable average acceptance lengths.
These results indicate that removing sequential dependencies in drafting is a
practical path toward lossless LLM inference acceleration.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种机器学习参数化方法（mloz），用于在气候模型中交互式模拟臭氧的日变化和趋势，显著提高了计算效率，并展示了在不同气候模型间的可移植性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大多数CMIP气候模型由于大气化学方案的高计算成本而缺乏交互式臭氧表示，这限制了气候敏感性模拟的准确性。

Method: 开发了基于机器学习参数化方法（mloz），仅使用大气温度剖面信息作为输入，在UKESM和ICON两种气候模型中在线实现臭氧的交互式模拟。

Result: mloz比UKESM中的化学方案快约31倍，仅占气候模型总运行时间的不到4%，且在十年时间尺度上表现出高保真度，并能成功移植到不同气候模型。

Conclusion: 该方法为缺乏交互式化学方案的CMIP级气候模型提供了广泛应用的潜力，特别是在关注气候敏感性模拟时，臭氧趋势和变化对大气反馈过程有重要调节作用。

Abstract: Atmospheric ozone is a crucial absorber of solar radiation and an important
greenhouse gas. However, most climate models participating in the Coupled Model
Intercomparison Project (CMIP) still lack an interactive representation of
ozone due to the high computational costs of atmospheric chemistry schemes.
Here, we introduce a machine learning parameterization (mloz) to interactively
model daily ozone variability and trends across the troposphere and
stratosphere in standard climate sensitivity simulations, including two-way
interactions of ozone with the Quasi-Biennial Oscillation. We demonstrate its
high fidelity on decadal timescales and its flexible use online across two
different climate models -- the UK Earth System Model (UKESM) and the German
ICOsahedral Nonhydrostatic (ICON) model. With atmospheric temperature profile
information as the only input, mloz produces stable ozone predictions around 31
times faster than the chemistry scheme in UKESM, contributing less than 4
percent of the respective total climate model runtimes. In particular, we also
demonstrate its transferability to different climate models without chemistry
schemes by transferring the parameterization from UKESM to ICON. This
highlights the potential for widespread adoption in CMIP-level climate models
that lack interactive chemistry for future climate change assessments,
particularly when focusing on climate sensitivity simulations, where ozone
trends and variability are known to significantly modulate atmospheric feedback
processes.

Motivation: 随着EEG消费设备的普及，脑电数据面临隐私泄露风险，特别是身份重识别问题。需要开发既能保护隐私又不影响EEG应用效用的方法。

Method: 使用基于Transformer的自编码器对EEG数据进行匿名化处理，在自动睡眠分期任务上评估匿名化前后数据的重识别风险和实用性。

Result: EEG信号的重识别能力显著降低，同时机器学习任务的效用得到保持。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效平衡EEG数据的隐私保护和实用价值，为EEG数据的安全使用提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) is widely used for recording brain activity and
has seen numerous applications in machine learning, such as detecting sleep
stages and neurological disorders. Several studies have successfully shown the
potential of EEG data for re-identification and leakage of other personal
information. Therefore, the increasing availability of EEG consumer devices
raises concerns about user privacy, motivating us to investigate how to
safeguard this sensitive data while retaining its utility for EEG applications.
To address this challenge, we propose a transformer-based autoencoder to create
EEG data that does not allow for subject re-identification while still
retaining its utility for specific machine learning tasks. We apply our
approach to automatic sleep staging by evaluating the re-identification and
utility potential of EEG data before and after anonymization. The results show
that the re-identifiability of the EEG signal can be substantially reduced
while preserving its utility for machine learning.

Conclusion: 研究结果凸显了基于影响的归因方法存在关键漏洞，表明需要开发鲁棒的防御机制来保护影响估计工具免受对抗攻击。

Abstract: Influence estimation tools -- such as memorization scores -- are widely used
to understand model behavior, attribute training data, and inform dataset
curation. However, recent applications in data valuation and responsible
machine learning raise the question: can these scores themselves be
adversarially manipulated? In this work, we present a systematic study of the
feasibility of attacking memorization-based influence estimators. We
characterize attacks for producing highly memorized samples as highly sensitive
queries in the regime where a trained algorithm is accurate. Our attack
(calculating the pseudoinverse of the input) is practical, requiring only
black-box access to model outputs and incur modest computational overhead. We
empirically validate our attack across a wide suite of image classification
tasks, showing that even state-of-the-art proxies are vulnerable to targeted
score manipulations. In addition, we provide a theoretical analysis of the
stability of memorization scores under adversarial perturbations, revealing
conditions under which influence estimates are inherently fragile. Our findings
highlight critical vulnerabilities in influence-based attribution and suggest
the need for robust defenses. All code can be found at

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种统一对比表示和时态距离两种框架的方法，通过准度量表示空间结构和额外约束来学习能够实现最优目标到达的后继表示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目标条件强化学习（GCRL）中，对比表示和时态距离两种框架各有优势但存在局限性。对比表示方法在稳定性和长时程能力上表现良好，但在拼接任务上表现不佳；准度量网络方法具有自由拼接能力，但在噪声高维环境中表现不佳。需要一种方法能够结合两者的优势。

Method: 使用准度量距离参数化来学习最优目标到达距离，即使在次优数据和随机环境中也能工作。该方法保留了蒙特卡洛对比强化学习方法的稳定性和长时程能力，同时获得了准度量网络参数化的自由拼接能力。

Result: 在现有离线GCRL基准测试中，该方法在对比学习方法难以处理的拼接任务上表现更好，同时在准度量网络方法难以处理的噪声高维环境中也表现更好。

Conclusion: 该方法成功统一了对比表示和时态距离两种框架，实现了两者的优势互补，为GCRL提供了一种更有效的表示学习方法。

Abstract: Approaches for goal-conditioned reinforcement learning (GCRL) often use
learned state representations to extract goal-reaching policies. Two frameworks
for representation structure have yielded particularly effective GCRL
algorithms: (1) *contrastive representations*, in which methods learn
"successor features" with a contrastive objective that performs inference over
future outcomes, and (2) *temporal distances*, which link the (quasimetric)
distance in representation space to the transit time from states to goals. We
propose an approach that unifies these two frameworks, using the structure of a
quasimetric representation space (triangle inequality) with the right
additional constraints to learn successor representations that enable optimal
goal-reaching. Unlike past work, our approach is able to exploit a
**quasimetric** distance parameterization to learn **optimal** goal-reaching
distances, even with **suboptimal** data and in **stochastic** environments.
This gives us the best of both worlds: we retain the stability and long-horizon
capabilities of Monte Carlo contrastive RL methods, while getting the free
stitching capabilities of quasimetric network parameterizations. On existing
offline GCRL benchmarks, our representation learning objective improves
performance on stitching tasks where methods based on contrastive learning
struggle, and on noisy, high-dimensional environments where methods based on
quasimetric networks struggle.

Abstract: Electroencephalography signals (EEGs) contain rich multi-scale information
crucial for understanding brain states, with potential applications in
diagnosing and advancing the drug development landscape. However, extracting
meaningful features from raw EEG signals while handling noise and channel
variability remains a major challenge. This work proposes a novel end-to-end
deep-learning framework that addresses these issues through several key
innovations. First, we designed an encoder capable of explicitly capturing
multi-scale frequency oscillations covering a wide range of features for
different EEG-related tasks. Secondly, to model complex dependencies and handle
the high temporal resolution of EEGs, we introduced an attention-based encoder
that simultaneously learns interactions across EEG channels and within
localized {\em patches} of individual channels. We integrated a dedicated
gating network on top of the attention encoder to dynamically filter out noisy
and non-informative channels, enhancing the reliability of EEG data. The entire
encoding process is guided by a novel loss function, which leverages supervised
and contrastive learning, significantly improving model generalization. We
validated our approach in multiple applications, ranging from the
classification of effects across multiple Central Nervous System (CNS)
disorders treatments to the diagnosis of Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease.
Our results demonstrate that the proposed learning paradigm can extract
biologically meaningful patterns from raw EEG signals across different species,
autonomously select high-quality channels, and achieve robust generalization
through innovative architectural and loss design.

TL;DR: DARTVAE是一个基于规则引导的多模态聚类框架，通过将领域特定约束嵌入到变分自编码器的表示学习过程中，实现更具操作意义和可解释性的聚类结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统聚类方法仅依赖输入数据的相似性，无法捕捉许多领域中关键的结构或语义约束。需要一种能够直接整合领域特定约束的聚类框架。

Method: 扩展VAE架构，嵌入显式规则、语义表示和数据驱动特征到统一潜在空间，通过规则一致性和违反惩罚在损失函数中强制约束合规。规则由LLM生成，构建为知识图谱，损失函数结合重构损失、KL散度、一致性惩罚和违反惩罚。

Result: 在飞机和汽车数据集上的实验表明，规则引导的聚类产生了更具操作意义和可解释性的聚类结果（如分离无人机、统一隐身飞机、区分SUV和轿车），同时改进了传统聚类指标。

Conclusion: DARTVAE通过结合规则编码和学习表示，比纯数据驱动模型实现了更有意义和一致的聚类结果，突显了约束引导多模态聚类在复杂知识密集型场景中的实用性，但也面临LLM生成规则可能产生幻觉或冲突、规则过多导致过拟合、复杂领域扩展的计算和一致性挑战。

Abstract: Traditional clustering techniques often rely solely on similarity in the
input data, limiting their ability to capture structural or semantic
constraints that are critical in many domains. We introduce the Domain Aware
Rule Triggered Variational Autoencoder (DARTVAE), a rule guided multimodal
clustering framework that incorporates domain specific constraints directly
into the representation learning process. DARTVAE extends the VAE architecture
by embedding explicit rules, semantic representations, and data driven features
into a unified latent space, while enforcing constraint compliance through rule
consistency and violation penalties in the loss function. Unlike conventional
clustering methods that rely only on visual similarity or apply rules as post
hoc filters, DARTVAE treats rules as first class learning signals. The rules
are generated by LLMs, structured into knowledge graphs, and enforced through a
loss function combining reconstruction, KL divergence, consistency, and
violation penalties. Experiments on aircraft and automotive datasets
demonstrate that rule guided clustering produces more operationally meaningful
and interpretable clusters for example, isolating UAVs, unifying stealth
aircraft, or separating SUVs from sedans while improving traditional clustering
metrics. However, the framework faces challenges: LLM generated rules may
hallucinate or conflict, excessive rules risk overfitting, and scaling to
complex domains increases computational and consistency difficulties. By
combining rule encodings with learned representations, DARTVAE achieves more

Method: 基于树结构矩阵的高效逆运算，开发新算法将稀疏注意力和循环依赖方法的优点相结合

Result: 未在摘要中明确说明具体实验结果

Conclusion: 提出的树结构矩阵逆运算方法能够有效结合稀疏注意力和循环依赖的优势，为解决注意力机制二次复杂度问题提供了新思路

Abstract: Attention layers apply a sequence-to-sequence mapping whose parameters depend
on the pairwise interactions of the input elements. However, without any
structural assumptions, memory and compute scale quadratically with the
sequence length. The two main ways to mitigate this are to introduce sparsity
by ignoring a sufficient amount of pairwise interactions or to introduce
recurrent dependence along them, as SSM does. Although both approaches are
reasonable, they both have disadvantages. We propose a novel algorithm that
combines the advantages of both concepts. Our idea is based on the efficient
inversion of tree-structured matrices.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种深度学习方法来预测混凝土中时间相关的全场损伤。该方法使用自回归U-Net模型预测给定微观结构几何形状和收缩剖面演化下的标量损伤场演化，并通过CNN预测关键力学性能。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统全场损伤评估计算量大，需要开发更高效的方法来理解骨料特性与混凝土力学性能之间的关系，以优化混凝土配合比设计。

Conclusion: 该方法有助于深入理解骨料形状、尺寸和分布与有效收缩和刚度降低之间的关系，可优化混凝土配合比设计，提高耐久性并减少内部损伤。

Abstract: This paper introduces a deep learning approach for predicting time-dependent
full-field damage in concrete. The study uses an auto-regressive U-Net model to
predict the evolution of the scalar damage field in a unit cell given
microstructural geometry and evolution of an imposed shrinkage profile. By
sequentially using the predicted damage output as input for subsequent
predictions, the model facilitates the continuous assessment of damage
progression. Complementarily, a convolutional neural network (CNN) utilises the
damage estimations to forecast key mechanical properties, including observed
shrinkage and residual stiffness. The proposed dual-network architecture
demonstrates high computational efficiency and robust predictive performance on
the synthesised datasets. The approach reduces the computational load
traditionally associated with full-field damage evaluations and is used to gain
insights into the relationship between aggregate properties, such as shape,
size, and distribution, and the effective shrinkage and reduction in stiffness.
Ultimately, this can help to optimize concrete mix designs, leading to improved
durability and reduced internal damage.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的熵最大化方法将策略推向均匀随机分布，这种无结构的探索策略有时效率低下，需要更鲁棒的探索机制

Method: 采用复杂度度量（香农熵与不平衡度的乘积）作为正则化项，开发了基于PPO的复杂度驱动策略优化算法CDPO

Result: 在离散动作空间任务中，CDPO对复杂度系数的选择比PPO对熵系数的选择更鲁棒，特别是在需要更多探索的环境中表现更好

Conclusion: 复杂度奖励能够引导智能体发现结构化且适应性强的策略，比传统熵奖励更有效地平衡探索与利用

Abstract: Policy gradient methods often balance exploitation and exploration via
entropy maximization. However, maximizing entropy pushes the policy towards a
uniform random distribution, which represents an unstructured and sometimes
inefficient exploration strategy. In this work, we propose replacing the
entropy bonus with a more robust complexity bonus. In particular, we adopt a
measure of complexity, defined as the product of Shannon entropy and
disequilibrium, where the latter quantifies the distance from the uniform
distribution. This regularizer encourages policies that balance stochasticity
(high entropy) with structure (high disequilibrium), guiding agents toward
regimes where useful, non-trivial behaviors can emerge. Such behaviors arise
because the regularizer suppresses both extremes, e.g., maximal disorder and
complete order, creating pressure for agents to discover structured yet
adaptable strategies. Starting from Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), we
introduce Complexity-Driven Policy Optimization (CDPO), a new learning
algorithm that replaces entropy with complexity. We show empirically across a
range of discrete action space tasks that CDPO is more robust to the choice of
the complexity coefficient than PPO is with the entropy coefficient, especially
in environments requiring greater exploration.

Motivation: 恢复高维信号是逆问题的核心挑战，虽然生成扩散模型在实践中表现出色，但缺乏严格的理论保证。本文旨在为基于扩散的逆问题算法提供理论分析框架。

Method: 采用确定性版本的Kadkhodaie & Simoncelli算法，将噪声卷积分数解释为时变投影，将扩散先验算法建模为广义投影梯度下降方法。

Conclusion: 该理论框架为扩散模型在逆问题中的应用提供了严格的理论基础，即使在非凸模型集上也能建立全局收敛保证。

Abstract: Recovering high-dimensional signals from corrupted measurements is a central
challenge in inverse problems. Recent advances in generative diffusion models
have shown remarkable empirical success in providing strong data-driven priors,
but rigorous recovery guarantees remain limited. In this work, we develop a
theoretical framework for analyzing deterministic diffusion-based algorithms
for inverse problems, focusing on a deterministic version of the algorithm
proposed by Kadkhodaie \& Simoncelli \cite{kadkhodaie2021stochastic}. First, we
show that when the underlying data distribution concentrates on a
low-dimensional model set, the associated noise-convolved scores can be
interpreted as time-varying projections onto such a set. This leads to
interpreting previous algorithms using diffusion priors for inverse problems as
generalized projected gradient descent methods with varying projections. When
the sensing matrix satisfies a restricted isometry property over the model set,
we can derive quantitative convergence rates that depend explicitly on the
noise schedule. We apply our framework to two instructive data distributions:
uniform distributions over low-dimensional compact, convex sets and low-rank
Gaussian mixture models. In the latter setting, we can establish global
convergence guarantees despite the nonconvexity of the underlying model set.

Method: 开发MDBench框架，评估12种算法在77个动态系统（14个PDEs和63个ODEs）上的表现，使用导数预测精度、模型复杂度和方程保真度等指标，并引入7个具有挑战性的流体动力学和热力学PDE系统。

Result: 线性方法在PDEs上达到最低预测误差，遗传编程方法在ODEs上表现最佳；线性模型对噪声更具鲁棒性；当前方法在处理复杂PDE系统时存在明显局限性。

Conclusion: MDBench通过提供严格的基准测试框架和丰富的动态系统数据集，促进了模型发现方法的系统评估和改进，加速了该领域的发展。

Abstract: Model discovery aims to uncover governing differential equations of dynamical
systems directly from experimental data. Benchmarking such methods is essential
for tracking progress and understanding trade-offs in the field. While prior
efforts have focused mostly on identifying single equations, typically framed
as symbolic regression, there remains a lack of comprehensive benchmarks for
discovering dynamical models. To address this, we introduce MDBench, an
open-source benchmarking framework for evaluating model discovery methods on
dynamical systems. MDBench assesses 12 algorithms on 14 partial differential
equations (PDEs) and 63 ordinary differential equations (ODEs) under varying
levels of noise. Evaluation metrics include derivative prediction accuracy,
model complexity, and equation fidelity. We also introduce seven challenging
PDE systems from fluid dynamics and thermodynamics, revealing key limitations
in current methods. Our findings illustrate that linear methods and genetic
programming methods achieve the lowest prediction error for PDEs and ODEs,
respectively. Moreover, linear models are in general more robust against noise.
MDBench accelerates the advancement of model discovery methods by offering a
rigorous, extensible benchmarking framework and a rich, diverse collection of
dynamical system datasets, enabling systematic evaluation, comparison, and
improvement of equation accuracy and robustness.

Motivation: NPC模型虽然具有可解释性和高性能，但其基于神经网络的属性识别模型容易受到对抗攻击，可能影响最终预测结果。

Method: 提出RNPC方法，采用新颖的类级集成推理机制，确保两个模块输出的鲁棒组合。

Result: 理论分析证明RNPC比NPC具有更好的对抗鲁棒性，实验结果表明RNPC在图像分类任务中优于现有概念瓶颈模型。

Conclusion: RNPC在保持良性输入高精度的同时，显著提升了对抗攻击下的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Neural Probabilistic Circuits (NPCs), a new class of concept bottleneck
models, comprise an attribute recognition model and a probabilistic circuit for
reasoning. By integrating the outputs from these two modules, NPCs produce
compositional and interpretable predictions. While offering enhanced
interpretability and high performance on downstream tasks, the
neural-network-based attribute recognition model remains a black box. This
vulnerability allows adversarial attacks to manipulate attribute predictions by
introducing carefully crafted subtle perturbations to input images, potentially
compromising the final predictions. In this paper, we theoretically analyze the
adversarial robustness of NPC and demonstrate that it only depends on the
robustness of the attribute recognition model and is independent of the
robustness of the probabilistic circuit. Moreover, we propose RNPC, the first
robust neural probabilistic circuit against adversarial attacks on the
recognition module. RNPC introduces a novel class-wise integration for
inference, ensuring a robust combination of outputs from the two modules. Our
theoretical analysis demonstrates that RNPC exhibits provably improved
adversarial robustness compared to NPC. Empirical results on image
classification tasks show that RNPC achieves superior adversarial robustness
compared to existing concept bottleneck models while maintaining high accuracy
on benign inputs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 糖尿病影响全球超过5.37亿人，预计到2045年将达到7.83亿人。早期风险分层可以从机器学习中受益，需要评估不同混合分类器的泛化性能。

Method: 构建两种混合分类器：XGBoost+随机森林和SVM+逻辑回归。使用泄漏安全的标准化流程，在主要数据集上训练后冻结模型，然后在PIMA队列上进行外部验证，评估判别性能和校准能力。

Result: 在主要数据集上，XGB-RF（AUROC 0.995，AUPRC 0.998）优于SVM-LR（AUROC 0.978，AUPRC 0.947）。在外部验证中，XGB-RF保持强劲性能（AUROC 0.990，AUPRC 0.959），而SVM-LR性能较低（AUROC 0.963，AUPRC 0.875）。

Conclusion: XGB-RF在内部和外部队列中始终优于SVM-LR，表现出较小的外部衰减和可接受的校准。结果支持基于梯度提升的混合方法作为糖尿病风险分层的稳健、可转移方法。

Abstract: Background/Purpose: Diabetes affects over 537 million people worldwide and is
projected to reach 783 million by 2045. Early risk stratification can benefit
from machine learning. We compare two hybrid classifiers and assess their
generalizability on an external cohort.
  Methods: Two hybrids were built: (i) XGBoost + Random Forest (XGB-RF) and
(ii) Support Vector Machine + Logistic Regression (SVM-LR). A leakage-safe,
standardized pipeline (encoding, imputation, min-max scaling; SMOTE on training
folds only; probability calibration for SVM) was fit on the primary dataset and
frozen. Evaluation prioritized threshold-independent discrimination
(AUROC/AUPRC) and calibration (Brier, slope/intercept). External validation
used the PIMA cohort (N=768) with the frozen pipeline; any thresholded metrics
on PIMA were computed at the default rule tau = 0.5.
  Results: On the primary dataset (PR baseline = 0.50), XGB-RF achieved AUROC
~0.995 and AUPRC ~0.998, outperforming SVM-LR (AUROC ~0.978; AUPRC ~0.947). On
PIMA (PR baseline ~0.349), XGB-RF retained strong performance (AUROC ~0.990;
AUPRC ~0.959); SVM-LR was lower (AUROC ~0.963; AUPRC ~0.875). Thresholded
metrics on PIMA at tau = 0.5 were XGB-RF (Accuracy 0.960; Precision 0.941;
Recall 0.944; F1 0.942) and SVM-LR (Accuracy 0.900; Precision 0.855; Recall
0.858; F1 0.857).
  Conclusions: Across internal and external cohorts, XGB-RF consistently
dominated SVM-LR and exhibited smaller external attenuation on ROC/PR with
acceptable calibration. These results support gradient-boosting-based
hybridization as a robust, transferable approach for diabetes risk
stratification and motivate prospective, multi-site validation with
deployment-time threshold selection based on clinical trade-offs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在科学领域生成能力强但常违反物理定律，现有方法依赖DPS式价值函数近似存在误差，导致训练不稳定和推理效率低。

Method: PIRF方法：1）层级截断反向传播利用物理奖励的时空局部性；2）基于权重的正则化方案比传统蒸馏方法更高效。

Result: 在五个PDE基准测试中，PIRF在高效采样机制下始终实现更优的物理约束执行效果。

Conclusion: 奖励微调方法在推进科学生成建模方面具有潜力，PIRF为物理约束生成提供了新视角。

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated strong generative capabilities across
scientific domains, but often produce outputs that violate physical laws. We
propose a new perspective by framing physics-informed generation as a sparse
reward optimization problem, where adherence to physical constraints is treated
as a reward signal. This formulation unifies prior approaches under a
reward-based paradigm and reveals a shared bottleneck: reliance on diffusion
posterior sampling (DPS)-style value function approximations, which introduce
non-negligible errors and lead to training instability and inference
inefficiency. To overcome this, we introduce Physics-Informed Reward
Fine-tuning (PIRF), a method that bypasses value approximation by computing
trajectory-level rewards and backpropagating their gradients directly. However,
a naive implementation suffers from low sample efficiency and compromised data
fidelity. PIRF mitigates these issues through two key strategies: (1) a
layer-wise truncated backpropagation method that leverages the spatiotemporally
localized nature of physics-based rewards, and (2) a weight-based
regularization scheme that improves efficiency over traditional
distillation-based methods. Across five PDE benchmarks, PIRF consistently
achieves superior physical enforcement under efficient sampling regimes,
highlighting the potential of reward fine-tuning for advancing scientific
generative modeling.

Motivation: 贝叶斯神经网络在实际应用中难以获得准确的不确定性量化，部分原因是超参数选择困难且影响不透明，需要系统分析超参数的影响。

Method: 采用全局敏感性分析方法，在变化的超参数设置下评估BNNs的性能表现。

Conclusion: 建议在实际应用中使用全局敏感性分析或贝叶斯优化等方法来辅助超参数选择和降维，以确保BNNs获得准确的不确定性量化。

Abstract: In scientific applications, predictive modeling is often of limited use
without accurate uncertainty quantification (UQ) to indicate when a model may
be extrapolating or when more data needs to be collected. Bayesian Neural
Networks (BNNs) produce predictive uncertainty by propagating uncertainty in
neural network (NN) weights and offer the promise of obtaining not only an
accurate predictive model but also accurate UQ. However, in practice, obtaining
accurate UQ with BNNs is difficult due in part to the approximations used for
practical model training and in part to the need to choose a suitable set of
hyperparameters; these hyperparameters outnumber those needed for traditional
NNs and often have opaque effects on the results. We aim to shed light on the
effects of hyperparameter choices for BNNs by performing a global sensitivity
analysis of BNN performance under varying hyperparameter settings. Our results
indicate that many of the hyperparameters interact with each other to affect
both predictive accuracy and UQ. For improved usage of BNNs in real-world
applications, we suggest that global sensitivity analysis, or related methods
such as Bayesian optimization, should be used to aid in dimensionality
reduction and selection of hyperparameters to ensure accurate UQ in BNNs.

Abstract: The Fast Multipole Method (FMM) is an efficient numerical algorithm for
computation of long-ranged forces in $N$-body problems within gravitational and
electrostatic fields. This method utilizes multipole expansions of the Green's
function inherent to the underlying dynamical systems. Despite its widespread
application in physics and engineering, the integration of FMM with modern

a novel neural network architecture, the Neural FMM, that integrates the
information flow of the FMM into a hierarchical machine learning framework for
learning the Green's operator of an Elliptic PDE. Our Neural FMM architecture
leverages a hierarchical computation flow of the FMM method to split up the
local and far-field interactions and efficiently learn their respective
representations.

Motivation: 传统神经SDE求解器的反向传播存在两难：离散化-优化方法内存成本高，优化-离散化方法梯度近似误差大。现有可逆求解器如Reversible Heun在复杂模型和大步长下不稳定

Method: 开发了显式且有效对称（EES）的Runge-Kutta方案，保留了可逆求解器的优点同时克服了不稳定性问题

Result: 数值实验表明EES方案具有优越的稳定性和可靠性，能够在不受步长或模型复杂度严格限制的情况下实现内存高效训练

Conclusion: EES方案为神经SDE的可扩展和准确训练提供了实用基础

Abstract: Backpropagation through (neural) SDE solvers is traditionally approached in
two ways: discretise-then-optimise, which offers accurate gradients but incurs
prohibitive memory costs due to storing the full computational graph (even when
mitigated by checkpointing); and optimise-then-discretise, which achieves
constant memory cost by solving an auxiliary backward SDE, but suffers from
slower evaluation and gradient approximation errors. Algebraically reversible
solvers promise both memory efficiency and gradient accuracy, yet existing
methods such as the Reversible Heun scheme are often unstable under complex
models and large step sizes. We address these limitations by introducing a
novel class of stable, near-reversible Runge--Kutta schemes for neural SDEs.
These Explicit and Effectively Symmetric (EES) schemes retain the benefits of
reversible solvers while overcoming their instability, enabling
memory-efficient training without severe restrictions on step size or model
complexity. Through numerical experiments, we demonstrate the superior
stability and reliability of our schemes, establishing them as a practical
foundation for scalable and accurate training of neural SDEs.

Abstract: Function encoders are a recent technique that learn neural network basis
functions to form compact, adaptive representations of Hilbert spaces of
functions. We show that function encoders provide a principled connection to
feature learning and kernel methods by defining a kernel through an inner
product of the learned feature map. This kernel-theoretic perspective explains
their ability to scale independently of dataset size while adapting to the
intrinsic structure of data, and it enables kernel-style analysis of neural
models. Building on this foundation, we develop two training algorithms that
learn compact bases: a progressive training approach that constructively grows
bases, and a train-then-prune approach that offers a computationally efficient
alternative after training. Both approaches use principles from PCA to reveal
the intrinsic dimension of the learned space. In parallel, we derive
finite-sample generalization bounds using Rademacher complexity and PAC-Bayes
techniques, providing inference time guarantees. We validate our approach on a
polynomial benchmark with a known intrinsic dimension, and on nonlinear
dynamical systems including a Van der Pol oscillator and a two-body orbital
model, demonstrating that the same accuracy can be achieved with substantially
fewer basis functions. This work suggests a path toward neural predictors with
kernel-level guarantees, enabling adaptable models that are both efficient and
principled at scale.

Conclusion: 扩散模型为互信息估计提供了一种直接有效的方法，通过MMSE差异和自适应采样实现了可扩展且鲁棒的估计性能。

Abstract: Mutual information (MI) is one of the most general ways to measure
relationships between random variables, but estimating this quantity for
complex systems is challenging. Denoising diffusion models have recently set a
new bar for density estimation, so it is natural to consider whether these
methods could also be used to improve MI estimation. Using the recently
introduced information-theoretic formulation of denoising diffusion models, we
show the diffusion models can be used in a straightforward way to estimate MI.
In particular, the MI corresponds to half the gap in the Minimum Mean Square
Error (MMSE) between conditional and unconditional diffusion, integrated over
all Signal-to-Noise-Ratios (SNRs) in the noising process. Our approach not only
passes self-consistency tests but also outperforms traditional and score-based
diffusion MI estimators. Furthermore, our method leverages adaptive importance
sampling to achieve scalable MI estimation, while maintaining strong
performance even when the MI is high.

Conclusion: SIL-C框架有效解决了技能增量学习中的兼容性问题，为构建可重用和可泛化的分层策略提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Skill Incremental Learning (SIL) is the process by which an embodied agent
expands and refines its skill set over time by leveraging experience gained
through interaction with its environment or by the integration of additional
data. SIL facilitates efficient acquisition of hierarchical policies grounded
in reusable skills for downstream tasks. However, as the skill repertoire
evolves, it can disrupt compatibility with existing skill-based policies,
limiting their reusability and generalization. In this work, we propose SIL-C,
a novel framework that ensures skill-policy compatibility, allowing
improvements in incrementally learned skills to enhance the performance of
downstream policies without requiring policy re-training or structural
adaptation. SIL-C employs a bilateral lazy learning-based mapping technique to
dynamically align the subtask space referenced by policies with the skill space
decoded into agent behaviors. This enables each subtask, derived from the
policy's decomposition of a complex task, to be executed by selecting an
appropriate skill based on trajectory distribution similarity. We evaluate
SIL-C across diverse SIL scenarios and demonstrate that it maintains
compatibility between evolving skills and downstream policies while ensuring
efficiency throughout the learning process.

*Matthias Chung,Deepanshu Verma,Max Collins,Amit N. Subrahmanya,Varuni Katti Sastry,Vishwas Rao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Latent Twins提出了一个统一的数学框架，在潜在空间中为底层方程创建隐藏代理模型，将经典建模、反演、模型降阶和算子逼近统一为单一原理的特殊情况。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 科学机器学习在复杂系统分析、建模和预测方面取得了进展，但表示学习与算法求解方法往往并行发展，缺乏统一框架。

Method: 通过创建潜在空间中的隐藏代理模型，用学习到的算子来管理数学系统，将数字孪生概念扩展到潜在空间。

Result: 在ODE、PDE基准测试和真实地理数据重建中验证了框架的有效性，相比DeepONet和4D-Var基线表现出色。

Conclusion: Latent Twins提供了紧凑、可解释的代理模型，能够桥接数据驱动的表示学习和经典科学建模，具有可扩展性和理论基础。

Abstract: Over the past decade, scientific machine learning has transformed the
development of mathematical and computational frameworks for analyzing,
modeling, and predicting complex systems. From inverse problems to numerical
PDEs, dynamical systems, and model reduction, these advances have pushed the
boundaries of what can be simulated. Yet they have often progressed in
parallel, with representation learning and algorithmic solution methods
evolving largely as separate pipelines. With \emph{Latent Twins}, we propose a
unifying mathematical framework that creates a hidden surrogate in latent space
for the underlying equations. Whereas digital twins mirror physical systems in
the digital world, Latent Twins mirror mathematical systems in a learned latent
space governed by operators. Through this lens, classical modeling, inversion,
model reduction, and operator approximation all emerge as special cases of a
single principle. We establish the fundamental approximation properties of
Latent Twins for both ODEs and PDEs and demonstrate the framework across three
representative settings: (i) canonical ODEs, capturing diverse dynamical
regimes; (ii) a PDE benchmark using the shallow-water equations, contrasting
Latent Twin simulations with DeepONet and forecasts with a 4D-Var baseline; and
(iii) a challenging real-data geopotential reanalysis dataset, reconstructing
and forecasting from sparse, noisy observations. Latent Twins provide a
compact, interpretable surrogate for solution operators that evaluate across
arbitrary time gaps in a single-shot, while remaining compatible with
scientific pipelines such as assimilation, control, and uncertainty
quantification. Looking forward, this framework offers scalable,
theory-grounded surrogates that bridge data-driven representation learning and
classical scientific modeling across disciplines.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种新方法，将多轮任务规划转化为单轮任务推理问题，通过GRPO方法实现高效策略优化，在复杂任务规划基准测试中取得了优异性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 训练LLM代理进行复杂多轮任务规划面临稀疏奖励、长时程信用分配和强化学习计算开销等挑战，需要更高效的优化方法。

Method: 采用Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)方法，将多轮任务规划转化为单轮任务推理问题，利用专家轨迹提供密集可验证的奖励。

Result: 1.5B参数模型在超过30步的长时程规划任务中达到70%的成功率，性能优于高达14B参数的基线模型。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅提高了多轮任务的成功概率，还展示了强大的跨任务泛化能力，复杂任务训练的模型能够成功完成所有更简单的子任务。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
knowledge acquisition, reasoning, and tool use, making them promising
candidates for autonomous agent applications. However, training LLM agents for
complex multi-turn task planning faces significant challenges, including sparse
episode-wise rewards, credit assignment across long horizons, and the
computational overhead of reinforcement learning in multi-turn interaction
settings. To this end, this paper introduces a novel approach that transforms
multi-turn task planning into single-turn task reasoning problems, enabling
efficient policy optimization through Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)
with dense and verifiable reward from expert trajectories. Our theoretical
analysis shows that GRPO improvement on single-turn task reasoning results in
higher multi-turn success probability under the minimal turns, as well as the
generalization to subtasks with shorter horizons. Experimental evaluation on
the complex task planning benchmark demonstrates that our 1.5B parameter model
trained with single-turn GRPO achieves superior performance compared to larger
baseline models up to 14B parameters, with success rates of 70% for
long-horizon planning tasks with over 30 steps. We also theoretically and
empirically validate the strong cross-task generalizability that the models
trained on complex tasks can lead to the successful completion of all simpler
subtasks.

TL;DR: PFedDL是一个联邦学习框架，用于解决多站点fMRI研究中的数据隐私和站点异质性挑战，通过分解站点特定字典为共享全局组件和个性化本地组件来提高模型泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多站点fMRI研究面临数据隐私约束和站点异质性导致的非IID数据问题，这些因素阻碍了通用模型的开发。

Method: PFedDL在每个站点独立进行字典学习，将站点特定字典分解为共享全局组件和个性化本地组件。全局原子通过联邦聚合更新以促进跨站点一致性，本地原子独立优化以捕捉站点特异性。

Result: 在ABIDE数据集上的实验表明，PFedDL在非IID数据集上的准确性和鲁棒性优于现有方法。

Conclusion: PFedDL通过联邦字典学习有效解决了多站点fMRI分析中的数据隐私和异质性挑战，为神经影像学协作研究提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Data privacy constraints pose significant challenges for large-scale
neuroimaging analysis, especially in multi-site functional magnetic resonance
imaging (fMRI) studies, where site-specific heterogeneity leads to
non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data. These factors
hinder the development of generalizable models. To address these challenges, we
propose Personalized Federated Dictionary Learning (PFedDL), a novel federated
learning framework that enables collaborative modeling across sites without
sharing raw data. PFedDL performs independent dictionary learning at each site,
decomposing each site-specific dictionary into a shared global component and a
personalized local component. The global atoms are updated via federated
aggregation to promote cross-site consistency, while the local atoms are
refined independently to capture site-specific variability, thereby enhancing
downstream analysis. Experiments on the ABIDE dataset demonstrate that PFedDL
outperforms existing methods in accuracy and robustness across non-IID
datasets.

TL;DR: 本文研究了音频大语言模型是否真正在听音频还是仅依赖文本推理，通过MM-SHAP框架量化各模态对模型输出的贡献。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 音频大语言模型能够进行类似人类的音乐对话，但不确定它们是否真正在听音频还是仅使用文本推理，需要量化各模态的贡献。

Method: 采用MM-SHAP框架（基于Shapley值的性能无关评分）来量化每个模态对模型预测的相对贡献，并在MuChoMusic基准上评估两个模型。

Result: 发现准确率更高的模型更多依赖文本来回答问题，但进一步检查显示即使音频整体贡献较低，模型也能成功定位关键声音事件，表明音频并未被完全忽略。

Conclusion: 这是MM-SHAP在音频大语言模型中的首次应用，希望为可解释AI和音频领域的未来研究奠定基础。

Abstract: Audio Large Language Models (Audio LLMs) enable human-like conversation about
music, yet it is unclear if they are truly listening to the audio or just using
textual reasoning, as recent benchmarks suggest. This paper investigates this
issue by quantifying the contribution of each modality to a model's output. We
adapt the MM-SHAP framework, a performance-agnostic score based on Shapley
values that quantifies the relative contribution of each modality to a model's
prediction. We evaluate two models on the MuChoMusic benchmark and find that
the model with higher accuracy relies more on text to answer questions, but
further inspection shows that even if the overall audio contribution is low,
models can successfully localize key sound events, suggesting that audio is not
entirely ignored. Our study is the first application of MM-SHAP to Audio LLMs
and we hope it will serve as a foundational step for future research in
explainable AI and audio.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有好奇心机制在稀疏奖励的多智能体强化学习中存在问题：将环境随机性误认为有意义的新颖性，且忽视同伴行为中包含的任务动态信息，导致探索效率低下。

Method: 受人类儿童通过观察同伴来调整探索行为的启发，提出CERMIC框架，通过过滤噪声信号、动态校准内在好奇心，并基于信息增益生成理论驱动的内在奖励。

Result: 在VMAS、Meltingpot和SMACv2等基准测试中，CERMIC显著优于现有最先进算法。

Conclusion: CERMIC通过整合多智能体上下文信息，有效提升了稀疏奖励环境下的探索效率，为多智能体强化学习提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Autonomous exploration in complex multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL)
with sparse rewards critically depends on providing agents with effective
intrinsic motivation. While artificial curiosity offers a powerful
self-supervised signal, it often confuses environmental stochasticity with
meaningful novelty. Moreover, existing curiosity mechanisms exhibit a uniform
novelty bias, treating all unexpected observations equally. However, peer
behavior novelty, which encode latent task dynamics, are often overlooked,
resulting in suboptimal exploration in decentralized, communication-free MARL
settings. To this end, inspired by how human children adaptively calibrate
their own exploratory behaviors via observing peers, we propose a novel
approach to enhance multi-agent exploration. We introduce CERMIC, a principled
framework that empowers agents to robustly filter noisy surprise signals and
guide exploration by dynamically calibrating their intrinsic curiosity with
inferred multi-agent context. Additionally, CERMIC generates
theoretically-grounded intrinsic rewards, encouraging agents to explore state
transitions with high information gain. We evaluate CERMIC on benchmark suites
including VMAS, Meltingpot, and SMACv2. Empirical results demonstrate that
exploration with CERMIC significantly outperforms SoTA algorithms in
sparse-reward environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在超级计算机上运行昂贵的化学计算实验之前，用户需要知道最优的资源配置参数（节点数和瓦片大小），以最小化执行时间或资源使用成本。

Method: 评估了基于梯度提升（GB）机器学习模型的丰富策略，使用在DOE Frontier和Aurora超级计算机上收集的CCSD应用运行时参数值进行训练，并采用主动学习策略减少实验数据收集成本。

Result: 在预测CCSD迭代总执行时间时，梯度提升模型在Aurora和Frontier上的平均绝对百分比误差（MAPE）分别为0.023和0.073；主动学习策略仅需约450个实验就能达到约0.2的MAPE。

Conclusion: 机器学习方法能够有效预测化学计算应用的资源需求，帮助用户在运行昂贵实验前优化参数配置，主动学习策略显著减少了数据收集成本。

Abstract: In this work, we develop machine learning (ML) based strategies to predict
resources (costs) required for massively parallel chemistry computations, such
as coupled-cluster methods, to guide application users before they commit to
running expensive experiments on a supercomputer. By predicting application
execution time, we determine the optimal runtime parameter values such as
number of nodes and tile sizes. Two key questions of interest to users are
addressed. The first is the shortest-time question, where the user is
interested in knowing the parameter configurations (number of nodes and tile
sizes) to achieve the shortest execution time for a given problem size and a
target supercomputer. The second is the cheapest-run question in which the user
is interested in minimizing resource usage, i.e., finding the number of nodes
and tile size that minimizes the number of node-hours for a given problem size.
  We evaluate a rich family of ML models and strategies, developed based on the
collections of runtime parameter values for the CCSD (Coupled Cluster with
Singles and Doubles) application executed on the Department of Energy (DOE)
Frontier and Aurora supercomputers. Our experiments show that when predicting
the total execution time of a CCSD iteration, a Gradient Boosting (GB) ML model
achieves a Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 0.023 and 0.073 for Aurora
and Frontier, respectively. In the case where it is expensive to run
experiments just to collect data points, we show that active learning can
achieve a MAPE of about 0.2 with just around 450 experiments collected from
Aurora and Frontier.

Motivation: 上下文学习虽然灵活，但其可靠性对提示长度高度敏感，需要理论指导来确保ICL在实际应用中的稳定性

Method: 基于固定高维次高斯表示建立ICL稳定性的非渐近下界，提出两阶段可观测估计器，通过一次性校准产生实际可用的提示长度估计

Result: 实验表明预测阈值与经验拐点高度一致，理论界限作为保守但可靠的上界，校准版本进一步缩小了差距

Conclusion: 研究结果将谱覆盖与稳定ICL联系起来，弥合了理论与部署之间的鸿沟，提高了大规模提示在有限样本机制下的可解释性和可靠性

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) is flexible but its reliability is highly sensitive
to prompt length. This paper establishes a non-asymptotic lower bound that
links the minimal number of demonstrations to ICL stability under fixed
high-dimensional sub-Gaussian representations. The bound gives explicit
sufficient conditions in terms of spectral properties of the covariance,
providing a computable criterion for practice. Building on this analysis, we
propose a two-stage observable estimator with a one-shot calibration that
produces practitioner-ready prompt-length estimates without distributional
priors. Experiments across diverse datasets, encoders, and generators show
close alignment between the predicted thresholds and empirical knee-points,
with the theory acting as a conservative but reliable upper bound; the
calibrated variant further tightens this gap. These results connect spectral
coverage to stable ICL, bridge theory and deployment, and improve the
interpretability and reliability of large-scale prompting in realistic
finite-sample regimes.

TL;DR: 本文提出了双谱最优传输（Bispectral Optimal Transport），一种对称感知的离散最优传输扩展方法，通过使用双谱表示来比较元素，在保持信号结构的同时消除群作用带来的变化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在对称性丰富的场景中，仅基于原始特征间几何距离的最优传输对齐可能忽略数据的内在相干结构。传统方法无法有效处理由视觉对称性变换引起的变化。

Method: 引入双谱最优传输，使用双谱（一种群傅里叶不变量）来表示元素，该表示在保持所有信号结构的同时仅消除由群作用引起的变化。

Result: 在经视觉对称性变换的基准数据集上，双谱最优传输计算的传输计划比原始特征最优传输实现了更高的类别保持准确率。

Conclusion: 双谱最优传输能够提高有意义的对应关系的质量，捕获数据集中底层语义标签结构，同时消除不影响类别或内容的干扰变化。

Abstract: Optimal transport (OT) is a widely used technique in machine learning,
graphics, and vision that aligns two distributions or datasets using their
relative geometry. In symmetry-rich settings, however, OT alignments based
solely on pairwise geometric distances between raw features can ignore the
intrinsic coherence structure of the data. We introduce Bispectral Optimal
Transport, a symmetry-aware extension of discrete OT that compares elements
using their representation using the bispectrum, a group Fourier invariant that
preserves all signal structure while removing only the variation due to group
actions. Empirically, we demonstrate that the transport plans computed with
Bispectral OT achieve greater class preservation accuracy than naive feature OT
on benchmark datasets transformed with visual symmetries, improving the quality
of meaningful correspondences that capture the underlying semantic label
structure in the dataset while removing nuisance variation not affecting class
or content.

Motivation: 虽然联邦学习被认为是隐私保护的协作训练框架，但现有研究假设全局模型只包含泛化知识而不会泄露隐私。本文旨在验证在联邦学习环境下微调大语言模型是否真的能保护客户端数据隐私。

Method: 通过大量实验验证联邦学习框架下的隐私泄露风险，包括使用简单生成方法提取训练数据，并提出针对联邦学习的增强攻击策略，通过跟踪训练过程中的全局模型更新来加剧隐私泄露。

Result: 实验表明攻击者仍能从全局模型中提取训练数据，泄露程度随模型规模增大而增加。增强攻击策略进一步加剧了隐私泄露风险。评估了差分隐私、正则化约束更新和安全对齐等隐私保护技术的效果。

Conclusion: 联邦学习框架下微调大语言模型存在显著的隐私泄露风险，需要采用有效的隐私保护技术来降低风险。研究结果为联邦学习中训练大语言模型提供了实用的隐私保护指导。

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) with local data is a widely adopted
approach for organizations seeking to adapt LLMs to their specific domains.
Given the shared characteristics in data across different organizations, the
idea of collaboratively fine-tuning an LLM using data from multiple sources
presents an appealing opportunity. However, organizations are often reluctant
to share local data, making centralized fine-tuning impractical. Federated
learning (FL), a privacy-preserving framework, enables clients to retain local
data while sharing only model parameters for collaborative training, offering a
potential solution. While fine-tuning LLMs on centralized datasets risks data
leakage through next-token prediction, the iterative aggregation process in FL
results in a global model that encapsulates generalized knowledge, which some
believe protects client privacy. In this paper, however, we present
contradictory findings through extensive experiments. We show that attackers
can still extract training data from the global model, even using
straightforward generation methods, with leakage increasing as the model size
grows. Moreover, we introduce an enhanced attack strategy tailored to FL, which
tracks global model updates during training to intensify privacy leakage. To
mitigate these risks, we evaluate privacy-preserving techniques in FL,
including differential privacy, regularization-constrained updates and adopting
LLMs with safety alignment. Our results provide valuable insights and practical
guidelines for reducing privacy risks when training LLMs with FL.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of drug-target binding affinity can accelerate drug
discovery by prioritizing promising compounds before costly wet-lab screening.
While deep learning has advanced this task, most models fuse ligand and protein
representations via simple concatenation and lack explicit geometric
regularization, resulting in poor generalization across chemical space and
time. We introduce FIRM-DTI, a lightweight framework that conditions molecular
embeddings on protein embeddings through a feature-wise linear modulation
(FiLM) layer and enforces metric structure with a triplet loss. An RBF
regression head operating on embedding distances yields smooth, interpretable
affinity predictions. Despite its modest size, FIRM-DTI achieves
state-of-the-art performance on the Therapeutics Data Commons DTI-DG benchmark,
as demonstrated by an extensive ablation study and out-of-domain evaluation.
Our results underscore the value of conditioning and metric learning for robust

Motivation: 现有PPO方法在训练过程中会丢弃低概率token的梯度信号，但这些被裁剪的token在调节熵动态中起着关键作用。作者发现这些被忽视的梯度对探索-利用平衡有重要影响。

Method: 提出了CE-GPPO算法，以温和且有界的方式重新引入被裁剪token的梯度，通过控制裁剪区间外token的梯度幅度来实现更好的探索-利用权衡。

Result: 在数学推理基准测试上的广泛实验表明，CE-GPPO在不同模型规模下都一致优于强基线方法，有效缓解了熵不稳定性问题。

Conclusion: CE-GPPO算法通过梯度保留机制成功解决了PPO中梯度信号丢失的问题，为LLM的强化学习训练提供了更稳定的熵控制方法。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a powerful paradigm for optimizing
large language models (LLMs) to handle complex reasoning tasks. A core
challenge in this process lies in managing policy entropy, which reflects the
balance between exploration and exploitation during training. Existing methods,
such as proximal policy optimization (PPO) and its variants, discard valuable
gradient signals from low-probability tokens due to the clipping mechanism. We
systematically analyze the entropy dynamics and reveal that these clipped
tokens play a critical yet overlooked role in regulating entropy evolution. We
propose \textbf{C}ontrolling \textbf{E}ntropy via
\textbf{G}radient-\textbf{P}reserving \textbf{P}olicy \textbf{O}ptimization
(CE-GPPO), a novel algorithm that reintroduces gradients from clipped tokens in
native PPO in a gentle and bounded manner. By controlling the magnitude of
gradients from tokens outside the clipping interval, CE-GPPO is able to achieve
an exploration-exploitation trade-off. We provide theoretical justification and
empirical evidence showing that CE-GPPO effectively mitigates entropy
instability. Extensive experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks show
that CE-GPPO consistently outperforms strong baselines across different model
scales.

Abstract: Inspired by the effectiveness of genetic algorithms and the importance of
synthesizability in molecular design, we present SynGA, a simple genetic
algorithm that operates directly over synthesis routes. Our method features
custom crossover and mutation operators that explicitly constrain it to
synthesizable molecular space. By modifying the fitness function, we
demonstrate the effectiveness of SynGA on a variety of design tasks, including
synthesizable analog search and sample-efficient property optimization, for
both 2D and 3D objectives. Furthermore, by coupling SynGA with a machine
learning-based filter that focuses the building block set, we boost SynGA to
state-of-the-art performance. For property optimization, this manifests as a
model-based variant SynGBO, which employs SynGA and block filtering in the
inner loop of Bayesian optimization. Since SynGA is lightweight and enforces
synthesizability by construction, our hope is that SynGA can not only serve as
a strong standalone baseline but also as a versatile module that can be
incorporated into larger synthesis-aware workflows in the future.

Motivation: 深度学习中的缩放定律显示模型性能随数据集和模型规模呈幂律提升，但其数学起源特别是缩放指数一直未被理解。

Method: 使用核回归方法，证明数据协方差谱的多项式尾部会产生超额风险的幂律，缩放指数α=2s/(2s+1/β)，其中β控制谱尾，1/β衡量数据冗余度。

Result: 发现学习曲线的斜率不是普适的，而是依赖于数据冗余度，更陡的谱会加速规模回报。该定律在多种场景下具有普适性。

Conclusion: 这项工作首次为缩放定律提供了严格的数学解释，将其统一为有限样本冗余定律，将经验观察与理论基础联系起来。

Abstract: Scaling laws, a defining feature of deep learning, reveal a striking
power-law improvement in model performance with increasing dataset and model
size. Yet, their mathematical origins, especially the scaling exponent, have
remained elusive. In this work, we show that scaling laws can be formally
explained as redundancy laws. Using kernel regression, we show that a
polynomial tail in the data covariance spectrum yields an excess risk power law
with exponent alpha = 2s / (2s + 1/beta), where beta controls the spectral tail
and 1/beta measures redundancy. This reveals that the learning curve's slope is
not universal but depends on data redundancy, with steeper spectra accelerating
returns to scale. We establish the law's universality across boundedly
invertible transformations, multi-modal mixtures, finite-width approximations,
and Transformer architectures in both linearized (NTK) and feature-learning
regimes. This work delivers the first rigorous mathematical explanation of
scaling laws as finite-sample redundancy laws, unifying empirical observations
with theoretical foundations.

Abstract: This paper presents the first study on the impact of audio watermarking on
spoofing countermeasures. While anti-spoofing systems are essential for
securing speech-based applications, the influence of widely used audio
watermarking, originally designed for copyright protection, remains largely
unexplored. We construct watermark-augmented training and evaluation datasets,
named the Watermark-Spoofing dataset, by applying diverse handcrafted and
neural watermarking methods to existing anti-spoofing datasets. Experiments
show that watermarking consistently degrades anti-spoofing performance, with
higher watermark density correlating with higher Equal Error Rates (EERs). To
mitigate this, we propose the Knowledge-Preserving Watermark Learning (KPWL)
framework, enabling models to adapt to watermark-induced shifts while
preserving their original-domain spoofing detection capability. These findings
reveal audio watermarking as a previously overlooked domain shift and establish
the first benchmark for developing watermark-resilient anti-spoofing systems.

### [203] [Measuring LLM Sensitivity in Transformer-based Tabular Data Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20768)
*Maria F. Davila R,Azizjon Turaev,Wolfram Wingerath*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文对Transformer-based表格数据合成工具进行敏感性评估，分析超参数选择对合成数据质量和计算性能的影响，比较GReaT和REaLTabFormer两种工具在10种不同架构配置下的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer-based模型在表格数据合成质量上优于GAN和Diffusion模型，但计算成本高，需要研究如何通过超参数调整在保持数据质量的同时降低计算需求。

Method: 在两个工具(GReaT和REaLTabFormer)上评估10种不同架构深度和类型的模型配置，从运行时间、机器学习效用和与真实数据分布相似性三个维度进行敏感性分析，使用四个真实世界数据集进行实验。

Result: 运行时间与超参数数量成正比，浅层配置完成更快；GReaT运行时间始终低于REaLTabFormer；小数据集上两种工具都能生成高质量合成数据，但大数据集上只有REaLTabFormer能保持强效用和相似性。

Conclusion: 轻量级LLM的REaLTabFormer提供了最佳平衡，在保持数据质量的同时减少计算需求，但其运行时间仍高于GReaT和其他TDS工具，表明效率提升存在一定限制。

Abstract: Synthetic tabular data is used for privacy-preserving data sharing and
data-driven model development. Its effectiveness, however, depends heavily on
the used Tabular Data Synthesis (TDS) tool. Recent studies have shown that
Transformer-based models outperform other state-of-the-art models such as
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Diffusion models in terms of data
quality. However, Transformer-based models also come with high computational
costs, making them sometimes unfeasible for end users with prosumer hardware.
This study presents a sensitivity assessment on how the choice of
hyperparameters, such as number of layers or hidden dimension affects the
quality of the resultant synthetic data and the computational performance. It
is performed across two tools, GReaT and REaLTabFormer, evaluating 10 model
setups that vary in architecture type and depth. We assess the sensitivity on
three dimensions: runtime, machine learning (ML) utility, and similarity to
real data distributions. Experiments were conducted on four real-world
datasets. Our findings reveal that runtime is proportional to the number of
hyperparameters, with shallower configurations completing faster. GReaT
consistently achieves lower runtimes than REaLTabFormer, and only on the
largest dataset they have comparable runtime. For small datasets, both tools
achieve synthetic data with high utility and optimal similarity, but on larger
datasets only REaLTabFormer sustains strong utility and similarity. As a
result, REaLTabFormer with lightweight LLMs provides the best balance, since it
preserves data quality while reducing computational requirements. Nonetheless,
its runtime remains higher than that of GReaT and other TDS tools, suggesting
that efficiency gains are possible but only up to a certain level.

*Alireza Heidari,Amirhossein Ahmad,Wei Zhang,Ying Xiong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Sig2Model是一种高效的自适应学习索引，通过sigmoid增强近似、主动更新训练和神经联合优化框架，显著降低了动态更新时的重训练成本，提高了查询性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统学习索引在静态数据集上表现出色，但在动态更新时性能下降，因为维护CDF不变性需要全局模型重训练，这会阻塞查询并限制QPS。现有方法未能有效解决重训练成本问题。

Method: 1) sigmoid增强近似技术：通过局部sigmoid函数近似数据分布变化，推迟完整重训练；2) 基于高斯混合模型的主动更新训练：识别高更新概率区域进行策略性占位符分配；3) 神经联合优化框架：通过梯度学习持续优化sigmoid集成和GMM参数。

Result: 在真实世界和合成工作负载上的评估显示，Sig2Model将重训练成本降低高达20倍，QPS提高高达3倍，内存使用减少高达1000倍。

Conclusion: Sig2Model通过创新的技术组合有效解决了学习索引在动态更新环境中的性能问题，为实际工作负载提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Learned Indexes (LIs) represent a paradigm shift from traditional index
structures by employing machine learning models to approximate the cumulative
distribution function (CDF) of sorted data. While LIs achieve remarkable
efficiency for static datasets, their performance degrades under dynamic
updates: maintaining the CDF invariant (sum of F(k) equals 1) requires global
model retraining, which blocks queries and limits the queries-per-second (QPS)
metric. Current approaches fail to address these retraining costs effectively,
rendering them unsuitable for real-world workloads with frequent updates. In
this paper, we present Sig2Model, an efficient and adaptive learned index that
minimizes retraining cost through three key techniques: (1) a sigmoid boosting
approximation technique that dynamically adjusts the index model by
approximating update-induced shifts in data distribution with localized sigmoid
functions while preserving bounded error guarantees and deferring full
retraining; (2) proactive update training via Gaussian mixture models (GMMs)
that identifies high-update-probability regions for strategic placeholder
allocation to speed up updates; and (3) a neural joint optimization framework
that continuously refines both the sigmoid ensemble and GMM parameters via
gradient-based learning. We evaluate Sig2Model against state-of-the-art
updatable learned indexes on real-world and synthetic workloads, and show that
Sig2Model reduces retraining cost by up to 20x, achieves up to 3x higher QPS,
and uses up to 1000x less memory.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合MLP和CNN的时间序列预测模型，使用MLP捕捉长期趋势，CNN处理局部季节性模式和残差，通过IConv架构独立处理通道依赖关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界时间序列数据存在非平稳性，MLP模型在处理多样化分布通道时存在局限性，无法有效捕捉局部变化如季节性模式和残差成分。

Method: 结合MLP和CNN：MLP建模整体趋势以考虑长期依赖，CNN使用多样化核函数建模细粒度局部模式。提出IConv架构，独立处理通道时间依赖，通过不同层考虑通道间关系。

Result: 在时间序列数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法在多元时间序列预测方面具有优越性。

Conclusion: 提出的MLP-CNN混合模型能够有效解决MLP在处理局部变化时的局限性，在多元时间序列预测任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Real-world time-series data often exhibit non-stationarity, including
changing trends, irregular seasonality, and residuals. In terms of changing
trends, recently proposed multi-layer perceptron (MLP)-based models have shown
excellent performance owing to their computational efficiency and ability to
capture long-term dependency. However, the linear nature of MLP architectures
poses limitations when applied to channels with diverse distributions,
resulting in local variations such as seasonal patterns and residual components
being ignored. However, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can effectively
incorporate these variations. To resolve the limitations of MLP, we propose
combining them with CNNs. The overall trend is modeled using an MLP to consider
long-term dependencies. The CNN uses diverse kernels to model fine-grained
local patterns in conjunction with MLP trend predictions. To focus on modeling
local variation, we propose IConv, a novel convolutional architecture that
processes the temporal dependency channel independently and considers the
inter-channel relationship through distinct layers. Independent channel
processing enables the modeling of diverse local temporal dependencies and the
adoption of a large kernel size. Distinct inter-channel considerations reduce
computational cost. The proposed model is evaluated through extensive
experiments on time-series datasets. The results reveal the superiority of the
proposed method for multivariate time-series forecasting.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LiLAW是一种轻量级自适应加权方法，通过三个可学习参数动态调整训练样本的损失权重，根据样本难度（简单、中等、困难）进行优先级排序，提升模型在噪声标签和数据异构环境下的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决深度神经网络在噪声标签和数据异构环境下训练的挑战，传统方法需要大量超参数调优或干净验证集，而LiLAW旨在提供更实用高效的解决方案。

Method: 使用三个可学习参数为每个训练样本动态分配损失权重，基于样本难度进行自适应调整。在每个训练小批量后，使用验证集上的单个小批量梯度下降步骤更新权重，无需干净验证集或复杂超参数调优。

Result: 在多个通用和医学影像数据集、不同噪声水平和类型、损失函数及架构上的实验表明，LiLAW能一致提升性能，即使在高噪声环境下也有效，且不依赖数据增强或高级正则化。

Conclusion: LiLAW提供了一种计算高效的方法，可在任何神经网络训练设置中增强模型的泛化能力和鲁棒性，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Training deep neural networks in the presence of noisy labels and data
heterogeneity is a major challenge. We introduce Lightweight Learnable Adaptive
Weighting (LiLAW), a novel method that dynamically adjusts the loss weight of
each training sample based on its evolving difficulty level, categorized as
easy, moderate, or hard. Using only three learnable parameters, LiLAW
adaptively prioritizes informative samples throughout training by updating
these weights using a single mini-batch gradient descent step on the validation
set after each training mini-batch, without requiring excessive hyperparameter
tuning or a clean validation set. Extensive experiments across multiple general
and medical imaging datasets, noise levels and types, loss functions, and
architectures with and without pretraining demonstrate that LiLAW consistently
enhances performance, even in high-noise environments. It is effective without
heavy reliance on data augmentation or advanced regularization, highlighting
its practicality. It offers a computationally efficient solution to boost model
generalization and robustness in any neural network training setup.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了任务依赖初始化（TDI）框架，通过功率谱匹配方法将状态空间模型（SSMs）的归纳偏置与任务的光谱特征对齐，显著提高了模型的泛化能力和样本效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模模型的成功依赖于缩放定律，但高质量数据的有限性带来了挑战。现有状态空间模型使用固定的归纳偏置，当任务底层结构与模型偏置不匹配时会导致样本效率低下。

Method: 首先形式化线性时不变SSMs的归纳偏置，提出TDI方法：通过功率谱匹配在大型训练前将模型的归纳偏置与任务的光谱特征对齐。

Result: 在多样化真实世界基准测试中，TDI显著改善了泛化能力和样本效率，特别是在低数据情况下效果明显。

Conclusion: 这项工作为创建更数据高效的模型提供了理论和实践工具，是实现可持续缩放的关键一步。

Abstract: The remarkable success of large-scale models is fundamentally tied to scaling
laws, yet the finite nature of high-quality data presents a looming challenge.
One of the next frontiers in modeling is data efficiency: the ability to learn
more from less. A model's inductive bias is a critical lever for this, but
foundational sequence models like State Space Models (SSMs) rely on a fixed
bias. This fixed prior is sample-inefficient when a task's underlying structure
does not match. In this work, we introduce a principled framework to solve this
problem. We first formalize the inductive bias of linear time-invariant SSMs
through an SSM-induced kernel, mathematically and empirically proving its
spectrum is directly governed by the model's frequency response. Further, we
propose a method of Task-Dependent Initialization (TDI): power spectrum
matching, a fast and efficient method that aligns the model's inductive bias
with the task's spectral characteristics before large-scale training. Our
experiments on a diverse set of real-world benchmarks show that TDI
significantly improves generalization and sample efficiency, particularly in
low-data regimes. This work provides a theoretical and practical tool to create
more data-efficient models, a crucial step towards sustainable scaling.

*Zhengxiao Li,Liming Lu,Xu Zheng,Siyuan Liang,Zhenghan Chen,Yongbin Zhou,Shuchao Pang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了FERD框架，首个关注鲁棒性公平性的数据自由鲁棒性蒸馏方法，通过调整对抗样本的比例和分布来解决不同类别间鲁棒性差异问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据自由鲁棒性蒸馏方法只关注整体鲁棒性，忽视了鲁棒性公平性问题，导致不同类别间的鲁棒性存在严重差异。研究发现两个关键问题：学生模型在不同类别间表现差异显著，且鲁棒性在不同攻击目标下不稳定。

Method: FERD采用鲁棒性引导的类别重加权策略调整对抗样本比例，为鲁棒性较弱的类别合成更多样本；通过公平感知样本(FAEs)和均匀目标对抗样本(UTAEs)调整分布，前者施加特征级预测均匀性约束，后者应用均匀目标类约束避免偏置攻击方向。

Result: 在三个公开数据集上的实验表明，FERD在所有对抗攻击下都达到了最先进的最差类别鲁棒性，例如在CIFAR-10上使用MobileNet-V2时，FGSM和AutoAttack下的最差类别鲁棒性分别提高了15.1%和6.4%。

Conclusion: FERD在鲁棒性和公平性方面都表现出优越性能，有效解决了数据自由鲁棒性蒸馏中的公平性问题，实现了更平衡的跨类别鲁棒性表现。

Abstract: Data-Free Robustness Distillation (DFRD) aims to transfer the robustness from
the teacher to the student without accessing the training data. While existing
methods focus on overall robustness, they overlook the robust fairness issues,
leading to severe disparity of robustness across different categories. In this
paper, we find two key problems: (1) student model distilled with equal class
proportion data behaves significantly different across distinct categories; and
(2) the robustness of student model is not stable across different attacks
target. To bridge these gaps, we present the first Fairness-Enhanced data-free
Robustness Distillation (FERD) framework to adjust the proportion and
distribution of adversarial examples. For the proportion, FERD adopts a
robustness-guided class reweighting strategy to synthesize more samples for the
less robust categories, thereby improving robustness of them. For the
distribution, FERD generates complementary data samples for advanced robustness
distillation. It generates Fairness-Aware Examples (FAEs) by enforcing a
uniformity constraint on feature-level predictions, which suppress the
dominance of class-specific non-robust features, providing a more balanced
representation across all categories. Then, FERD constructs Uniform-Target
Adversarial Examples (UTAEs) from FAEs by applying a uniform target class
constraint to avoid biased attack directions, which distribute the attack
targets across all categories and prevents overfitting to specific vulnerable
categories. Extensive experiments on three public datasets show that FERD
achieves state-of-the-art worst-class robustness under all adversarial attack
(e.g., the worst-class robustness under FGSM and AutoAttack are improved by
15.1\% and 6.4\% using MobileNet-V2 on CIFAR-10), demonstrating superior
performance in both robustness and fairness aspects.

TL;DR: T2I-Diff是一个基于时间-频率表示和去噪扩散模型的fMRI生成框架，旨在解决传统生成模型在处理BOLD信号非平稳性和非线性动态时的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: fMRI数据采集资源密集，高质量样本稀缺，而现有生成模型往往忽略了BOLD信号的复杂动态特性，导致生成效果不佳。

Method: 首先将BOLD信号通过时变傅里叶变换转换为窗谱图，捕捉时空动态和频谱演化；然后训练无分类器的扩散模型生成类条件频率谱图；最后通过逆傅里叶变换还原为BOLD信号。

Result: 该方法在下游fMRI脑网络分类任务中表现出更高的准确性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: T2I-Diff框架通过结合时间-频率分析和扩散模型，有效提升了fMRI数据的生成质量，为数据驱动的脑分析提供了更可靠的合成数据源。

Abstract: Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) is an advanced neuroimaging
method that enables in-depth analysis of brain activity by measuring dynamic
changes in the blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signals. However, the
resource-intensive nature of fMRI data acquisition limits the availability of
high-fidelity samples required for data-driven brain analysis models. While
modern generative models can synthesize fMRI data, they often underperform
because they overlook the complex non-stationarity and nonlinear BOLD dynamics.
To address these challenges, we introduce T2I-Diff, an fMRI generation
framework that leverages time-frequency representation of BOLD signals and
classifier-free denoising diffusion. Specifically, our framework first converts
BOLD signals into windowed spectrograms via a time-dependent Fourier transform,
capturing both the underlying temporal dynamics and spectral evolution.
Subsequently, a classifier-free diffusion model is trained to generate
class-conditioned frequency spectrograms, which are then reverted to BOLD
signals via inverse Fourier transforms. Finally, we validate the efficacy of
our approach by demonstrating improved accuracy and generalization in
downstream fMRI-based brain network classification.

TL;DR: CaTS-Bench是第一个大规模、真实世界的时间序列描述基准，包含46.5万训练和10.5万测试时间戳，提供数值序列、元数据、图表图像和描述文本，并引入新的评估指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有时间序列描述基准通常依赖合成数据或过于简化的描述，且忽略元数据和视觉表示，无法满足真实世界需求。

Method: 从11个多样化数据集构建基准，采用可扩展的管道生成参考描述：大部分由oracle LLM生成并通过事实检查、人类不可区分性研究和多样性分析验证，同时提供579个人工修订测试描述。

Result: 建立了可靠的时间序列描述基准，并评估了领先的视觉语言模型，揭示了其优势和局限性。

Conclusion: CaTS-Bench及其描述管道为时间序列分析与基础模型的交叉研究提供了可靠且可扩展的基础。

Abstract: Time series captioning, the task of describing numeric time series in natural
language, requires numerical reasoning, trend interpretation, and contextual
understanding. Existing benchmarks, however, often rely on synthetic data or
overly simplistic captions, and typically neglect metadata and visual
representations. To close this gap, we introduce CaTS-Bench, the first
large-scale, real-world benchmark for Context-aware Time Series captioning.
CaTS-Bench is derived from 11 diverse datasets reframed as captioning and Q&A
tasks, comprising roughly 465k training and 105k test timestamps. Each sample
includes a numeric series segment, contextual metadata, a line-chart image, and
a caption. A key contribution of this work is the scalable pipeline used to
generate reference captions: while most references are produced by an oracle
LLM and verified through factual checks, human indistinguishability studies,
and diversity analyses, we also provide a human-revisited subset of 579 test
captions, refined from LLM outputs to ensure accuracy and human-like style.
Beyond captioning, CaTS-Bench offers 460 multiple-choice questions targeting
deeper aspects of time series reasoning. We further propose new tailored
evaluation metrics and benchmark leading VLMs, highlighting both their
strengths and persistent limitations. Together, these contributions establish
CaTS-Bench and its captioning pipeline as a reliable and extensible foundation
for future research at the intersection of time series analysis and foundation
models.

Motivation: 深度神经网络训练动态中的后期现象（如grokking和信息瓶颈）机制及其关系尚不明确，需要统一的理论解释。

Method: 通过分析神经坍缩的动态过程，研究类内方差收缩与训练集拟合不同时间尺度之间的关系，并在多个数据集和架构上进行验证。

Result: 发现类内方差收缩是grokking和信息瓶颈现象的关键因素，神经坍缩的进展与训练集拟合存在不同的时间尺度。

Conclusion: 神经坍缩为理解深度神经网络训练中的后期现象提供了统一框架，类内方差收缩是解释这些现象的核心机制。

Abstract: The training dynamics of deep neural networks often defy expectations, even
as these models form the foundation of modern machine learning. Two prominent
examples are grokking, where test performance improves abruptly long after the
training loss has plateaued, and the information bottleneck principle, where
models progressively discard input information irrelevant to the prediction
task as training proceeds. However, the mechanisms underlying these phenomena
and their relations remain poorly understood. In this work, we present a
unified explanation of such late-phase phenomena through the lens of neural
collapse, which characterizes the geometry of learned representations. We show
that the contraction of population within-class variance is a key factor
underlying both grokking and information bottleneck, and relate this measure to
the neural collapse measure defined on the training set. By analyzing the
dynamics of neural collapse, we show that distinct time scales between fitting
the training set and the progression of neural collapse account for the
behavior of the late-phase phenomena. Finally, we validate our theoretical
findings on multiple datasets and architectures.

Motivation: 多模态融合存在模态竞争问题，一个模态主导学习过程导致其他模态优化不足，现有方法大多在联合学习阶段解决此问题，忽视了模型初始状态的critical影响

Method: 两阶段训练框架：1）单模态训练阶段塑造初始ECS；2）开发可计算诊断指标FastPID（基于互信息和部分信息分解）来量化模态特异性、冗余性和协同性；3）异步训练控制器动态平衡模态并定位最佳初始状态

Result: 在多个基准测试上达到state-of-the-art性能，证明塑造预融合模型初始状态是缓解模态竞争的有效策略

Conclusion: 通过单模态训练塑造初始状态是解锁协同多模态融合的强大策略，在竞争开始前就缓解了模态竞争问题

Abstract: Multi-modal fusion often suffers from modality competition during joint
training, where one modality dominates the learning process, leaving others
under-optimized. Overlooking the critical impact of the model's initial state,
most existing methods address this issue during the joint learning stage. In
this study, we introduce a two-stage training framework to shape the initial
states through unimodal training before the joint training. First, we propose
the concept of Effective Competitive Strength (ECS) to quantify a modality's
competitive strength. Our theoretical analysis further reveals that properly
shaping the initial ECS by unimodal training achieves a provably tighter error
bound. However, ECS is computationally intractable in deep neural networks. To
bridge this gap, we develop a framework comprising two core components: a
fine-grained computable diagnostic metric and an asynchronous training
controller. For the metric, we first prove that mutual information(MI) is a
principled proxy for ECS. Considering MI is induced by per-modality marginals
and thus treats each modality in isolation, we further propose FastPID, a
computationally efficient and differentiable solver for partial information
decomposition, which decomposes the joint distribution's information into
fine-grained measurements: modality-specific uniqueness, redundancy, and
synergy. Guided by these measurements, our asynchronous controller dynamically
balances modalities by monitoring uniqueness and locates the ideal initial
state to start joint training by tracking peak synergy. Experiments on diverse
benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance.
Our work establishes that shaping the pre-fusion models' initial state is a
powerful strategy that eases competition before it starts, reliably unlocking
synergistic multi-modal fusion.

Abstract: Multi-omics data capture complex biomolecular interactions and provide
insights into metabolism and disease. However, missing modalities hinder
integrative analysis across heterogeneous omics. To address this, we present
MOIRA (Multi-Omics Integration with Robustness to Absent modalities), an early
integration method enabling robust learning from incomplete omics data via
representation alignment and adaptive aggregation. MOIRA leverages all samples,
including those with missing modalities, by projecting each omics dataset onto
a shared embedding space where a learnable weighting mechanism fuses them.
Evaluated on the Religious Order Study and Memory and Aging Project (ROSMAP)
dataset for Alzheimer's Disease (AD), MOIRA outperformed existing approaches,
and further ablation studies confirmed modality-wise contributions. Feature
importance analysis revealed AD-related biomarkers consistent with prior
literature, highlighting the biological relevance of our approach.

Abstract: Time series generation (TSG) synthesizes realistic sequences and has achieved
remarkable success. Among TSG, conditional models generate sequences given
observed covariates, however, such models learn observational correlations
without considering unobserved confounding. In this work, we propose a causal
perspective on conditional TSG and introduce causal time series generation as a
new TSG task family, formalized within Pearl's causal ladder, extending beyond
observational generation to include interventional and counterfactual settings.
To instantiate these tasks, we develop CaTSG, a unified diffusion-based
framework with backdoor-adjusted guidance that causally steers sampling toward
desired interventions and individual counterfactuals while preserving
observational fidelity. Specifically, our method derives causal score functions
via backdoor adjustment and the abduction-action-prediction procedure, thus
enabling principled support for all three levels of TSG. Extensive experiments
on both synthetic and real-world datasets show that CaTSG achieves superior
fidelity and also supporting interventional and counterfactual generation that
existing baselines cannot handle. Overall, we propose the causal TSG family and
instantiate it with CaTSG, providing an initial proof-of-concept and opening a
promising direction toward more reliable simulation under interventions and
counterfactual generation.

Result: 该方法对不同程度的缺失数据具有鲁棒性，可用于信号修复和预测，能够支持AI风险算法的开发

Conclusion: 该方法可应用于回顾性研究数据集，未来可集成到可穿戴FHR监测设备中，实现更早、更稳健的风险检测

Abstract: Approximately 10\% of newborns require assistance to initiate breathing at
birth, and around 5\% need ventilation support. Fetal heart rate (FHR)
monitoring plays a crucial role in assessing fetal well-being during prenatal
care, enabling the detection of abnormal patterns and supporting timely
obstetric interventions to mitigate fetal risks during labor. Applying
artificial intelligence (AI) methods to analyze large datasets of continuous
FHR monitoring episodes with diverse outcomes may offer novel insights into
predicting the risk of needing breathing assistance or interventions. Recent
advances in wearable FHR monitors have enabled continuous fetal monitoring
without compromising maternal mobility. However, sensor displacement during
maternal movement, as well as changes in fetal or maternal position, often lead
to signal dropouts, resulting in gaps in the recorded FHR data. Such missing
data limits the extraction of meaningful insights and complicates automated
(AI-based) analysis. Traditional approaches to handle missing data, such as
simple interpolation techniques, often fail to preserve the spectral
characteristics of the signals. In this paper, we propose a masked
transformer-based autoencoder approach to reconstruct missing FHR signals by
capturing both spatial and frequency components of the data. The proposed
method demonstrates robustness across varying durations of missing data and can
be used for signal inpainting and forecasting. The proposed approach can be
applied retrospectively to research datasets to support the development of
AI-based risk algorithms. In the future, the proposed method could be
integrated into wearable FHR monitoring devices to achieve earlier and more
robust risk detection.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电子健康记录联邦学习中存在数据缺失挑战，特别是当不同医疗机构收集时间序列数据的时态粒度不一致时，需要一种隐私保护的全局插补方法。

Method: FMI方法允许ICU协作构建全局转移模型进行时间插补，通过联邦学习框架在保护隐私的前提下共享知识。

Conclusion: FMI为联邦学习中的时间序列数据缺失问题提供了有效的隐私保护解决方案，在医疗数据协作分析中具有重要应用价值。

Abstract: Missing data is a persistent challenge in federated learning on electronic
health records, particularly when institutions collect time-series data at
varying temporal granularities. To address this, we propose Federated Markov
Imputation (FMI), a privacy-preserving method that enables Intensive Care Units

imputation. We evaluate FMI on a real-world sepsis onset prediction task using
the MIMIC-IV dataset and show that it outperforms local imputation baselines,
especially in scenarios with irregular sampling intervals across ICUs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前对于LLM推理风格、模型架构和任务类型之间的相互作用缺乏深入理解，需要系统性的评估框架。

Method: 构建StyleBench基准，评估5种代表性推理风格（CoT、ToT、AoT、SoT、CoD）在5个推理任务上的表现，使用15个开源模型（270M-120B参数）。

Result: 没有单一最优推理风格；搜索类方法在开放性问题表现好但需要大模型；简洁风格在定义明确任务上效率高；小模型常无法遵循输出指令而猜测；推理鲁棒性随规模提升。

Conclusion: 研究结果为基于特定约束选择最优推理策略提供了重要路线图，并开源了基准测试。

Abstract: The effectiveness of Large Language Models (LLMs) is heavily influenced by
the reasoning strategies, or styles of thought, employed in their prompts.
However, the interplay between these reasoning styles, model architecture, and
task type remains poorly understood. To address this, we introduce StyleBench,
a comprehensive benchmark for systematically evaluating reasoning styles across
diverse tasks and models. We assess five representative reasoning styles,
including Chain of Thought (CoT), Tree of Thought (ToT), Algorithm of Thought
(AoT), Sketch of Thought (SoT), and Chain-of-Draft (CoD) on five reasoning
tasks, using 15 open-source models from major families (LLaMA, Qwen, Mistral,
Gemma, GPT-OSS, Phi, and DeepSeek) ranging from 270M to 120B parameters. Our
large-scale analysis reveals that no single style is universally optimal. We
demonstrate that strategy efficacy is highly contingent on both model scale and
task type: search-based methods (AoT, ToT) excel in open-ended problems but
require large-scale models, while concise styles (SoT, CoD) achieve radical
efficiency gains on well-defined tasks. Furthermore, we identify key behavioral
patterns: smaller models frequently fail to follow output instructions and
default to guessing, while reasoning robustness emerges as a function of scale.
Our findings offer a crucial roadmap for selecting optimal reasoning strategies
based on specific constraints, we open source the benchmark in
https://github.com/JamesJunyuGuo/Style_Bench.

TL;DR: 该论文研究强化学习中随机传感器延迟问题，提出了一种基于模型的延迟感知框架，能够有效处理观察数据乱序到达的情况。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实环境中经常存在延迟，但标准强化学习算法通常假设环境感知是瞬时的。论文针对POMDP中的随机传感器延迟问题进行研究，这种延迟导致观察数据可能乱序到达，是RL中尚未解决的问题。

Method: 提出基于模型的滤波过程，通过顺序更新信念状态来处理传入的观察流。引入简单的延迟感知框架，将该思想融入基于模型的强化学习中，使智能体能够有效处理随机延迟。将该框架应用于Dreamer算法。

Result: 该方法在延迟感知基准测试中表现优于为MDP开发的基线方法，并且在部署期间对延迟分布变化表现出鲁棒性。在模拟机器人任务上的实验也表明该方法优于常见的实用启发式方法。

Conclusion: 明确建模观察延迟对于处理现实环境中的延迟问题至关重要，提出的延迟感知框架能够有效提升强化学习算法在存在传感器延迟环境中的性能。

Abstract: Delays frequently occur in real-world environments, yet standard
reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms often assume instantaneous perception of
the environment. We study random sensor delays in POMDPs, where observations
may arrive out-of-sequence, a setting that has not been previously addressed in
RL. We analyze the structure of such delays and demonstrate that naive
approaches, such as stacking past observations, are insufficient for reliable
performance. To address this, we propose a model-based filtering process that
sequentially updates the belief state based on an incoming stream of
observations. We then introduce a simple delay-aware framework that
incorporates this idea into model-based RL, enabling agents to effectively
handle random delays. Applying this framework to Dreamer, we compare our
approach to delay-aware baselines developed for MDPs. Our method consistently
outperforms these baselines and demonstrates robustness to delay distribution
shifts during deployment. Additionally, we present experiments on simulated
robotic tasks, comparing our method to common practical heuristics and
emphasizing the importance of explicitly modeling observation delays.

*Christoph Düsing,Philipp Cimiano*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种联邦学习中的客户端选择方法，通过控制标签分布来缓解数据不平衡问题，包括平衡分布和联邦组合分布两种目标分布。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习中客户端数据不平衡会降低共享模型的性能，现有方法需要改进以更好地处理这种不平衡问题。

Method: 扩展现有联邦学习策略，选择能够使当前标签分布与目标分布（平衡分布或联邦组合分布）最佳对齐的活跃客户端。

Result: 在三种常见联邦学习策略和两个数据集上的实验表明，面对局部不平衡时，与平衡分布对齐效果最好；面对全局不平衡时，与联邦组合分布对齐更优。

Conclusion: 提出的分布控制客户端选择方法能有效改善联邦学习在数据不平衡场景下的性能，不同目标分布适用于不同类型的不平衡问题。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a distributed learning paradigm that allows
multiple clients to jointly train a shared model while maintaining data
privacy. Despite its great potential for domains with strict data privacy
requirements, the presence of data imbalance among clients is a thread to the
success of FL, as it causes the performance of the shared model to decrease. To
address this, various studies have proposed enhancements to existing FL
strategies, particularly through client selection methods that mitigate the
detrimental effects of data imbalance. In this paper, we propose an extension
to existing FL strategies, which selects active clients that best align the
current label distribution with one of two target distributions, namely a
balanced distribution or the federations combined label distribution.
Subsequently, we empirically verify the improvements through our
distribution-controlled client selection on three common FL strategies and two
datasets. Our results show that while aligning the label distribution with a
balanced distribution yields the greatest improvements facing local imbalance,
alignment with the federation's combined label distribution is superior for
global imbalance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 脓毒症早期准确预测对ICU患者预后至关重要，但传统机器学习模型受限于单个医院数据量不足，联邦学习可解决数据共享的隐私问题

Method: 使用联邦学习框架训练注意力增强的LSTM模型，支持可变预测窗口（短期和长期预测），在多中心ICU数据上进行协作训练

Result: 联邦学习不仅提升整体预测性能（接近集中式模型），特别有利于早期脓毒症检测；可变预测窗口在性能损失不大的情况下显著降低计算、通信和组织开销

Conclusion: 该方法在保护患者隐私的同时有效提升脓毒症早期预测能力，可变预测窗口设计具有实际应用价值

Abstract: Early and accurate prediction of sepsis onset remains a major challenge in
intensive care, where timely detection and subsequent intervention can
significantly improve patient outcomes. While machine learning models have
shown promise in this domain, their success is often limited by the amount and
diversity of training data available to individual hospitals and Intensive Care
Units (ICUs). Federated Learning (FL) addresses this issue by enabling
collaborative model training across institutions without requiring data
sharing, thus preserving patient privacy. In this work, we propose a federated,
attention-enhanced Long Short-Term Memory model for sepsis onset prediction,
trained on multi-centric ICU data. Unlike existing approaches that rely on
fixed prediction windows, our model supports variable prediction horizons,
enabling both short- and long-term forecasting in a single unified model.
During analysis, we put particular emphasis on the improvements through our
approach in terms of early sepsis detection, i.e., predictions with large
prediction windows by conducting an in-depth temporal analysis. Our results
prove that using FL does not merely improve overall prediction performance
(with performance approaching that of a centralized model), but is particularly
beneficial for early sepsis onset prediction. Finally, we show that our choice
of employing a variable prediction window rather than a fixed window does not
hurt performance significantly but reduces computational, communicational, and
organizational overhead.

Motivation: 现有的离散扩散模型使用随机去噪过程，本文旨在开发确定性反向过程以提升效率和样本质量，探索确定性方法在离散状态空间的有效性。

Method: 使用马尔可夫链和弱混沌动力学的放牧算法变体来去随机化生成反向过程，实现确定性离散状态转换，直接替代随机去噪过程。

Result: 在文本和图像生成任务中实现了效率和样本质量的一致提升，验证了确定性反向过程在离散状态空间的有效性。

Conclusion: 这种简单的去随机化方法有望增强离散扩散在生成建模中的重要性，并为离散状态空间的确定性反向过程提供了有效证明。

Abstract: We propose a deterministic denoising algorithm for discrete-state diffusion
models based on Markov chains. The generative reverse process is derandomized
by introducing a variant of the herding algorithm with weakly chaotic dynamics,
which induces deterministic discrete state transitions. Our approach is a
direct replacement for the stochastic denoising process, requiring neither
retraining nor continuous state embeddings. We demonstrate consistent
improvements in both efficiency and sample quality on text and image generation
tasks. Thus, this simple derandomization approach is expected to enhance the
significance of discrete diffusion in generative modeling. Furthermore, our
results reveal that deterministic reverse processes, well established in
continuous diffusion, can also be effective in discrete state spaces.

Motivation: 探索在精细时空分辨率下，结合微观移动特征、历史犯罪数据和社会人口数据是否能提高犯罪预测性能

Method: 使用ConvLSTM深度学习模型，结合四个美国城市的犯罪数据、社会人口调查数据和移动数据，比较不同输入序列长度下的预测效果

Result: 移动特征的加入显著提升预测性能，特别是短输入序列时。移动特征与社会人口特征结合效果最佳，深度学习模型在所有四个城市都取得最高召回率、精确率和F1分数

Conclusion: 整合多样化数据源对时空犯罪预测至关重要，深度学习在处理精细时空尺度时具有优势但也有局限性

Abstract: Objectives: To develop a deep learning framework to evaluate if and how
incorporating micro-level mobility features, alongside historical crime and
sociodemographic data, enhances predictive performance in crime forecasting at
fine-grained spatial and temporal resolutions.
  Methods: We advance the literature on computational methods and crime
forecasting by focusing on four U.S. cities (i.e., Baltimore, Chicago, Los
Angeles, and Philadelphia). We employ crime incident data obtained from each
city's police department, combined with sociodemographic data from the American
Community Survey and human mobility data from Advan, collected from 2019 to
2023. This data is aggregated into grids with equally sized cells of 0.077 sq.
miles (0.2 sq. kms) and used to train our deep learning forecasting model, a
Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (ConvLSTM) network, which predicts crime
occurrences 12 hours ahead using 14-day and 2-day input sequences. We also
compare its performance against three baseline models: logistic regression,
random forest, and standard LSTM.
  Results: Incorporating mobility features improves predictive performance,
especially when using shorter input sequences. Noteworthy, however, the best
results are obtained when both mobility and sociodemographic features are used
together, with our deep learning model achieving the highest recall, precision,
and F1 score in all four cities, outperforming alternative methods. With this
configuration, longer input sequences enhance predictions for violent crimes,
while shorter sequences are more effective for property crimes.
  Conclusion: These findings underscore the importance of integrating diverse
data sources for spatiotemporal crime forecasting, mobility included. They also
highlight the advantages (and limits) of deep learning when dealing with
fine-grained spatial and temporal scales.

Result: PFCV液压回路比传统PDCV回路能效提高8.5%，通过旁路泵的多余流量减少热量形式的能量损失。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法可显著提高重型土方设备线性执行器的能效，从而降低环境影响和运营成本。

Abstract: The article focuses on enhancing the energy efficiency of linear actuators
used in heavy earth moving equipment, particularly in the booms ofexcavation
equipment. Two hydraulic circuits are compared in terms of energy efficiency,
with one using a conventional proportional directionalcontrol valve (PDCV) and
the other using an innovative solution of proportional flow control valve
(PFCV) with artificial leakage between thetwo ends of the actuator. The PFCV
reduces energy loss in the form of heat by bypassing the extra flow from the
pump during position control,unlike the PDCV that uses a pressure relief valve.
The hydraulic circuit using PFCV is found to be 8.5% more energy efficient than
theconventional circuit using PDCV. The article also discusses the position
control of the actuator, which is achieved using a PID controller tuned by a
fuzzy controller. Thesimulation of the hydraulic circuit is carried out using
MATLAB/Simulink, and the results are compared with experiments. Overall, the
proposedapproach could lead to significant improvements in the energy
efficiency of linear actuators used in heavy earth moving equipment,
therebyreducing their environmental impact and operating costs.

Motivation: 现有方法为多元时间序列生成的反事实解释往往无效、不真实或不直观，需要开发能产生更真实和用户可理解的反事实解释的方法。

Method: 基于类别判别变分自编码器的生成框架，整合对比学习和分类一致性目标，采用原型初始化方法和真实性约束优化技术。

Result: 在雷达手势数据和手写字母轨迹数据集上，GenFacts在真实性方面比现有最优方法提升18.7%，在人类研究中获得最高可解释性评分。

Conclusion: 对于时间序列数据的可操作反事实解释，真实性和以用户为中心的可解释性比稀疏性更重要。

Abstract: Counterfactual explanations aim to enhance model transparency by showing how
inputs can be minimally altered to change predictions. For multivariate time
series, existing methods often generate counterfactuals that are invalid,
implausible, or unintuitive. We introduce GenFacts, a generative framework
based on a class-discriminative variational autoencoder. It integrates
contrastive and classification-consistency objectives, prototype-based
initialization, and realism-constrained optimization. We evaluate GenFacts on
radar gesture data as an industrial use case and handwritten letter
trajectories as an intuitive benchmark. Across both datasets, GenFacts
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in plausibility (+18.7%) and achieves
the highest interpretability scores in a human study. These results highlight
that plausibility and user-centered interpretability, rather than sparsity
alone, are key to actionable counterfactuals in time series data.

Motivation: 理解为什么Transformer在时间序列预测中表现不佳，探究注意力机制失效的原因。

Method: 设计渐进式实验将Transformer逐步修改为MLP，创建可解释数据集分析注意力机制，并进行理论分析。

Result: 发现现有时间序列Transformer中，Transformer块经常退化为简单MLP，注意力机制未按预期工作，当前嵌入方法无法让Transformer在良好结构的潜在空间中运行。

Conclusion: Transformer在时间序列预测中的失败主要源于嵌入方法的问题，导致注意力机制无法有效工作，需要重新设计适合时间序列的嵌入策略。

Abstract: Transformer-based architectures achieved high performance in natural language
processing and computer vision, yet many studies have shown that they have not
demonstrated a clear advantage in time series forecasting and even underperform
simple linear baselines in some cases. However, most of these studies have not
thoroughly explored the reasons behind the failure of transformers. To better
understand time-series transformers(TST), we designed a series of experiments,
progressively modifying transformers into MLPs to investigate the impact of the
attention mechanism. Surprisingly, transformer blocks often degenerate into
simple MLPs in existing time-series transformers. We designed a interpretable
dataset to investigate the reasons behind the failure of the attention
mechanism and revealed that the attention mechanism is not working in the
expected way. We theoretically analyzed the reasons behind this phenomenon,
demonstrating that the current embedding methods fail to allow transformers to
function in a well-structured latent space, and further analyzed the deeper
underlying causes of the failure of embedding.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种解耦值注意力机制，用于改进先验数据拟合网络在高维回归任务中的性能，使其能够更有效地逼近高斯过程推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准Transformer注意力在先验数据拟合网络中处理高维回归任务时效果有限，需要一种更有效的注意力机制来提升性能。

Method: 提出解耦值注意力机制，从输入计算相似度并通过值传播标签，模拟高斯过程更新但无需核函数。

Result: 在5维和10维情况下验证损失降低超过50%，64维电力流方程逼近的平均绝对误差达到1E-3量级，比精确高斯过程推理快80倍以上。

Conclusion: 注意力机制的选择比架构本身对先验数据拟合网络的扩展性更为关键，基于CNN的PFN可以与基于Transformer的PFN性能相当。

Abstract: Prior-data fitted networks (PFNs) are a promising alternative to
time-consuming Gaussian Process (GP) inference for creating fast surrogates of
physical systems. PFN reduces the computational burden of GP-training by
replacing Bayesian inference in GP with a single forward pass of a learned
prediction model. However, with standard Transformer attention, PFNs show
limited effectiveness on high-dimensional regression tasks. We introduce
Decoupled-Value Attention (DVA)-- motivated by the GP property that the
function space is fully characterized by the kernel over inputs and the
predictive mean is a weighted sum of training targets. DVA computes
similarities from inputs only and propagates labels solely through values.
Thus, the proposed DVA mirrors the Gaussian-process update while remaining
kernel-free. We demonstrate that the crucial factor for scaling PFNs is the
attention rule rather than the architecture itself. Specifically, our results
demonstrate that (a) localized attention consistently reduces out-of-sample
validation loss in PFNs across different dimensional settings, with validation
loss reduced by more than 50% in five- and ten-dimensional cases, and (b) the
role of attention is more decisive than the choice of backbone architecture,
showing that CNN-based PFNs can perform at par with their Transformer-based
counterparts. The proposed PFNs provide 64-dimensional power flow equation
approximations with a mean absolute error of the order of 1E-3, while being
over 80x faster than exact GP inference.

TL;DR: 本文分析了流匹配框架在低噪声区域存在的不稳定性问题，提出了局部对比流（LCF）方法来解决该问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 流匹配框架在低噪声区域存在根本性不稳定性，当噪声水平接近零时，输入的微小扰动会导致速度目标的大幅变化，使学习问题的条件数发散，这不仅减缓优化速度，还迫使编码器将有限的雅可比容量重新分配到噪声方向，从而降低语义表示质量

Method: 提出局部对比流（LCF），这是一种混合训练协议，在小噪声水平下用对比特征对齐替代直接速度回归，同时在中高噪声水平下保留标准流匹配

Result: LCF不仅提高了收敛速度，还稳定了表示质量

Conclusion: 解决低噪声病理问题对于充分发挥流匹配在生成和表示学习方面的潜力至关重要

Abstract: Flow matching has recently emerged as a powerful alternative to diffusion
models, providing a continuous-time formulation for generative modeling and
representation learning. Yet, we show that this framework suffers from a
fundamental instability in the low-noise regime. As noise levels approach zero,
arbitrarily small perturbations in the input can induce large variations in the
velocity target, causing the condition number of the learning problem to
diverge. This ill-conditioning not only slows optimization but also forces the
encoder to reallocate its limited Jacobian capacity toward noise directions,
thereby degrading semantic representations. We provide the first theoretical
analysis of this phenomenon, which we term the low-noise pathology,
establishing its intrinsic link to the structure of the flow matching
objective. Building on these insights, we propose Local Contrastive Flow (LCF),
a hybrid training protocol that replaces direct velocity regression with
contrastive feature alignment at small noise levels, while retaining standard
flow matching at moderate and high noise. Empirically, LCF not only improves
convergence speed but also stabilizes representation quality. Our findings
highlight the critical importance of addressing low-noise pathologies to unlock
the full potential of flow matching for both generation and representation
learning.

Motivation: 不同图表示的布尔电路提供互补的结构和语义信息，但视图间的结构异质性阻碍了有效融合，特别是对于掩码建模等自监督技术。

Method: 采用分阶段训练策略：首先通过等价对齐损失学习共享的功能感知表示空间，然后引入多视图掩码建模目标。

Result: 广泛的实验表明，对齐优先策略将掩码建模从无效技术转变为强大的性能驱动因素。

Conclusion: 功能对齐是多视图自监督学习的关键前提条件，能够有效解决结构异质性带来的融合挑战。

Abstract: Multiview learning on Boolean circuits holds immense promise, as different
graph-based representations offer complementary structural and semantic
information. However, the vast structural heterogeneity between views, such as
an And-Inverter Graph (AIG) versus an XOR-Majority Graph (XMG), poses a
critical barrier to effective fusion, especially for self-supervised techniques
like masked modeling. Naively applying such methods fails, as the cross-view
context is perceived as noise. Our key insight is that functional alignment is
a necessary precondition to unlock the power of multiview self-supervision. We
introduce MixGate, a framework built on a principled training curriculum that
first teaches the model a shared, function-aware representation space via an
Equivalence Alignment Loss. Only then do we introduce a multiview masked
modeling objective, which can now leverage the aligned views as a rich,
complementary signal. Extensive experiments, including a crucial ablation
study, demonstrate that our alignment-first strategy transforms masked modeling
from an ineffective technique into a powerful performance driver.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 个性化医疗需要基于患者个人基因和环境因素优化治疗方案，但现有替代模型难以泛化到未见过的患者-治疗组合，需要利用领域特定先验知识来改进。

Method: LEON通过'提示优化'实现，将LLMs作为随机引擎提出治疗设计，利用其上下文理解非结构化领域知识的能力，无需任务特定微调。

Conclusion: LEON提供了一种数学上严谨的方法来利用LLMs和领域知识进行个性化治疗优化，展示了在医疗决策支持中的潜力。

Abstract: The goal of personalized medicine is to discover a treatment regimen that
optimizes a patient's clinical outcome based on their personal genetic and
environmental factors. However, candidate treatments cannot be arbitrarily
administered to the patient to assess their efficacy; we often instead have
access to an in silico surrogate model that approximates the true fitness of a
proposed treatment. Unfortunately, such surrogate models have been shown to
fail to generalize to previously unseen patient-treatment combinations. We
hypothesize that domain-specific prior knowledge - such as medical textbooks
and biomedical knowledge graphs - can provide a meaningful alternative signal
of the fitness of proposed treatments. To this end, we introduce LLM-based
Entropy-guided Optimization with kNowledgeable priors (LEON), a mathematically
principled approach to leverage large language models (LLMs) as black-box
optimizers without any task-specific fine-tuning, taking advantage of their
ability to contextualize unstructured domain knowledge to propose personalized
treatment plans in natural language. In practice, we implement LEON via
'optimization by prompting,' which uses LLMs as stochastic engines for

LEON outperforms both traditional and LLM-based methods in proposing
individualized treatments for patients.

*Hang Chen,Jiaying Zhu,Xinyu Yang,Wenya Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了CLUE框架，通过电路发现技术识别LLM中负责遗忘和保留知识的不同神经元组，并使用CNF形式化方法进行精确干预，解决了现有方法中神经元纠缠的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM遗忘方法将负责遗忘和保留的神经元视为单一纠缠组，导致过度遗忘或擦除不完整的问题。需要区分不同功能的神经元以实现更精确的遗忘。

Method: 使用电路发现技术识别遗忘和保留电路，将其转换为合取范式(CNF)，通过可满足性解确定每个神经元应遗忘还是保留，并针对不同类别神经元制定微调策略。

Result: 大量实验表明，与现有定位方法相比，CLUE通过精确的神经元定位实现了更好的遗忘效果和保留效用。

Conclusion: CLUE框架能够有效解决LLM遗忘中的神经元纠缠问题，提供更精确的干预策略，在遗忘效果和知识保留方面优于现有方法。

Abstract: The LLM unlearning aims to eliminate the influence of undesirable data
without affecting causally unrelated information. This process typically
involves using a forget set to remove target information, alongside a retain
set to maintain non-target capabilities. While recent localization-based
methods demonstrate promise in identifying important neurons to be unlearned,
they fail to disentangle neurons responsible for forgetting undesirable
knowledge or retaining essential skills, often treating them as a single
entangled group. As a result, these methods apply uniform interventions,
risking catastrophic over-forgetting or incomplete erasure of the target
knowledge. To address this, we turn to circuit discovery, a mechanistic
interpretability technique, and propose the Conflict-guided Localization for
LLM Unlearning framEwork (CLUE). This framework identifies the forget and
retain circuit composed of important neurons, and then the circuits are
transformed into conjunctive normal forms (CNF). The assignment of each neuron
in the CNF satisfiability solution reveals whether it should be forgotten or
retained. We then provide targeted fine-tuning strategies for different
categories of neurons. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, compared to
existing localization methods, CLUE achieves superior forget efficacy and
retain utility through precise neural localization.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FracAug是一个创新的图级异常检测增强框架，通过生成语义一致的图变体和互验证伪标签来解决图神经网络在数据不平衡和标注成本高的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图级异常检测在药物发现等领域很重要，但高标注成本和数据集不平衡限制了图神经网络的性能。

Method: FracAug通过学习图内语义并合成部分变体，使用加权距离感知边界损失来生成多样化的语义保持图，然后利用原始图和增强图的预测结果对未标注数据进行伪标注，迭代扩展训练集。

Result: 在12个真实数据集上对14种图神经网络进行的实验显示，FracAug将平均AUROC、AUPRC和F1分数分别提升了5.72%、7.23%和4.18%。

Conclusion: FracAug作为一个模型无关的模块，具有显著的通用性和有效性，能够显著提升图级异常检测的性能。

Abstract: Graph-level anomaly detection (GAD) is critical in diverse domains such as
drug discovery, yet high labeling costs and dataset imbalance hamper the
performance of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). To address these issues, we
propose FracAug, an innovative plug-in augmentation framework that enhances
GNNs by generating semantically consistent graph variants and pseudo-labeling
with mutual verification. Unlike previous heuristic methods, FracAug learns
semantics within given graphs and synthesizes fractional variants, guided by a
novel weighted distance-aware margin loss. This captures multi-scale topology
to generate diverse, semantic-preserving graphs unaffected by data imbalance.
Then, FracAug utilizes predictions from both original and augmented graphs to
pseudo-label unlabeled data, iteratively expanding the training set. As a
model-agnostic module compatible with various GNNs, FracAug demonstrates
remarkable universality and efficacy: experiments across 14 GNNs on 12
real-world datasets show consistent gains, boosting average AUROC, AUPRC, and
F1-score by up to 5.72%, 7.23%, and 4.18%, respectively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有癌症筛查技术昂贵且侵入性强，全球可用性差，导致许多本可挽救的生命流失。需要开发基于常规医疗记录的早期检测方法。

Method: 基于数百万电子健康记录建立医疗代码序列预训练的基础模型（最大24亿参数），在医生标注的癌症风险预测队列上进行微调。

Result: 在3万患者回顾性评估中，CATCH-FM达到60%敏感性和99%特异性，优于基于特征的树模型和通用/医疗大语言模型。在EHRSHOT胰腺癌风险预测中表现最优。

Conclusion: CATCH-FM在不同患者分布中表现稳健，在ICD代码空间操作有优势，能捕捉非平凡癌症风险因素，代码将开源。

Abstract: Cancer screening, leading to early detection, saves lives. Unfortunately,
existing screening techniques require expensive and intrusive medical
procedures, not globally available, resulting in too many lost would-be-saved
lives. We present CATCH-FM, CATch Cancer early with Healthcare Foundation
Models, a cancer pre-screening methodology that identifies high-risk patients
for further screening solely based on their historical medical records. With
millions of electronic healthcare records (EHR), we establish the scaling law
of EHR foundation models pretrained on medical code sequences, pretrain
compute-optimal foundation models of up to 2.4 billion parameters, and finetune
them on clinician-curated cancer risk prediction cohorts. In our retrospective
evaluation comprising of thirty thousand patients, CATCH-FM achieved strong
efficacy (60% sensitivity) with low risk (99% specificity and Negative
Predictive Value), outperforming feature-based tree models as well as general
and medical large language models by large margins. Despite significant
demographic, healthcare system, and EHR coding differences, CATCH-FM achieves
state-of-the-art pancreatic cancer risk prediction on the EHRSHOT few-shot
leaderboard, outperforming EHR foundation models pretrained using on-site
patient data. Our analysis demonstrates the robustness of CATCH-FM in various
patient distributions, the benefits of operating in the ICD code space, and its
ability to capture non-trivial cancer risk factors. Our code will be
open-sourced.

TL;DR: LCR是一个基于学习的GPU缓存框架，通过LARU算法增强LRU缓存策略，结合机器学习预测和在线误差估计，在推荐模型和大型语言模型推理中显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代GPU推理中缓存效率是主要瓶颈，传统启发式策略如LRU在处理结构化访问模式时效果不佳，而现有学习方法存在预测不准确时性能急剧下降或设计保守收益有限的问题。

Method: 提出LCR框架，核心算法LARU在LRU基础上集成机器学习预测，通过在线误差估计动态适应预测准确性，实现预测准确时接近最优性能，预测不准时优雅退化到接近LRU性能。

Result: 实验显示LCR在DLRM和LLM场景中，吞吐量提升最高达24.2%，P99 TTFT降低最高达28.3%，即使在预测不佳时性能也保持稳定。

Conclusion: LCR在基于学习的缓存领域架起了实证进展与理论进展之间的桥梁，提供了实用且稳健的性能提升。

Abstract: In modern GPU inference, cache efficiency remains a major bottleneck. In
recommendation models, embedding hit rates largely determine throughput, while
in large language models, KV-cache misses substantially increase
time-to-first-token (TTFT). Heuristic policies such as \textsc{LRU} often
struggle under structured access patterns. Learning-based approaches are
promising, but in practice face two major limitations: they degrade sharply
when predictions are inaccurate, or they gain little even with accurate
predictions due to conservative designs. Some also incur high overhead, further
limiting practicality.
  We present \textsc{LCR}, a practical framework for learning-based GPU caching
that delivers performance gains while ensuring robustness and efficiency. Its
core algorithm, \textsc{LARU}, enhances \textsc{LRU} with machine-learned
predictions and dynamically adapts to prediction accuracy through online error
estimation. When predictions are accurate, \textsc{LARU} achieves near-optimal
performance. With inaccurate predictions, it degrades gracefully to
near-\textsc{LRU} performance. With \textsc{LCR}, we bridge the gap between
empirical progress and theoretical advances in learning-based caching.
  Experiments show that \textsc{LCR} delivers consistent gains under realistic
conditions. In DLRM and LLM scenarios, it improves throughput by up to 24.2\%
and reduces P99 TTFT by up to 28.3\%, outperforming widely used inference
systems. Even under poor predictions, its performance remains stable,
demonstrating practical robustness.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于伪似然最大化的方法，用于从单个样本中估计截断Ising模型的逆温度参数β，在约束集S可表示为k-SAT公式满足解集的情况下，实现了O(Δ³/√n)的一致性估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决从单个样本估计截断Ising模型参数的问题，特别是在约束集表达为k-SAT公式的复杂截断设置下，扩展了现有方法的应用范围。

Method: 基于伪似然最大化的估计方法，将Daskalakis等人和Galanis等人的技术推广到截断Ising模型，在近O(n)时间内构建估计器。

Result: 当k ≳ log(d²k)Δ³时，估计器β̂与真实参数β*具有O(Δ³/√n)的一致性，适用于有界度图G的截断Ising模型。

Conclusion: 该方法成功地将伪似然最大化技术应用于更具挑战性的截断Ising模型设置，为复杂约束下的参数估计提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: We consider the problem of estimating inverse temperature parameter $\beta$
of an $n$-dimensional truncated Ising model using a single sample. Given a
graph $G = (V,E)$ with $n$ vertices, a truncated Ising model is a probability
distribution over the $n$-dimensional hypercube $\{-1,1\}^n$ where each
configuration $\mathbf{\sigma}$ is constrained to lie in a truncation set $S
\subseteq \{-1,1\}^n$ and has probability $\Pr(\mathbf{\sigma}) \propto
\exp(\beta\mathbf{\sigma}^\top A\mathbf{\sigma})$ with $A$ being the adjacency
matrix of $G$. We adopt the recent setting of [Galanis et al. SODA'24], where
the truncation set $S$ can be expressed as the set of satisfying assignments of
a $k$-SAT formula. Given a single sample $\mathbf{\sigma}$ from a truncated
Ising model, with inverse parameter $\beta^*$, underlying graph $G$ of bounded
degree $\Delta$ and $S$ being expressed as the set of satisfying assignments of
a $k$-SAT formula, we design in nearly $O(n)$ time an estimator $\hat{\beta}$
that is $O(\Delta^3/\sqrt{n})$-consistent with the true parameter $\beta^*$ for
$k \gtrsim \log(d^2k)\Delta^3.$
  Our estimator is based on the maximization of the pseudolikelihood, a notion
that has received extensive analysis for various probabilistic models without
[Chatterjee, Annals of Statistics '07] or with truncation [Galanis et al. SODA
'24]. Our approach generalizes recent techniques from [Daskalakis et al. STOC
'19, Galanis et al. SODA '24], to confront the more challenging setting of the
truncated Ising model.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为二进制自编码器（BAE）的新方法，通过最小化小批量隐藏激活的熵来增强LLM特征解缠的稀疏性和独立性，解决了现有方法存在的特征稠密问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在解缠LLM隐藏状态中的特征时，通常依赖于单实例训练时的隐式正则化，缺乏对全局稀疏性的显式保证，导致产生大量稠密特征，损害了特征的稀疏性和原子化程度。

Method: 提出二进制自编码器（BAE），通过步进函数将隐藏激活离散化为1位，应用梯度估计实现反向传播，在小批量上强制最小熵约束，从而促进特征间的独立性和稀疏性。

Result: BAE在特征集熵计算和特征解缠两个主要应用中都表现出色：能够可靠估计二进制隐藏激活的熵来表征LLM推理动态，同时在特征提取方面避免了稠密特征，产生了最多的可解释特征。

Conclusion: BAE作为一种特征提取器是有效的，它解决了现有方法的稠密特征问题，在保持特征稀疏性的同时提高了特征的可解释性。

Abstract: Existing works are dedicated to untangling atomized numerical components
(features) from the hidden states of Large Language Models (LLMs) for
interpreting their mechanism. However, they typically rely on autoencoders
constrained by some implicit training-time regularization on single training
instances (i.e., $L_1$ normalization, top-k function, etc.), without an
explicit guarantee of global sparsity among instances, causing a large amount
of dense (simultaneously inactive) features, harming the feature sparsity and
atomization. In this paper, we propose a novel autoencoder variant that
enforces minimal entropy on minibatches of hidden activations, thereby
promoting feature independence and sparsity across instances. For efficient
entropy calculation, we discretize the hidden activations to 1-bit via a step
function and apply gradient estimation to enable backpropagation, so that we
term it as Binary Autoencoder (BAE) and empirically demonstrate two major
applications: (1) Feature set entropy calculation. Entropy can be reliably
estimated on binary hidden activations, which we empirically evaluate and
leverage to characterize the inference dynamics of LLMs and In-context
Learning. (2) Feature untangling. Similar to typical methods, BAE can extract
atomized features from LLM's hidden states. To robustly evaluate such feature
extraction capability, we refine traditional feature-interpretation methods to
avoid unreliable handling of numerical tokens, and show that BAE avoids dense
features while producing the largest number of interpretable ones among
baselines, which confirms the effectiveness of BAE serving as a feature
extractor.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于局部唯一标识符（Local-UID）的图神经网络方法，用于解决整数线性规划（ILP）问题。通过d跳邻域内的唯一性着色方案，在保持表达力的同时提高了泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准匿名图神经网络在ILP问题上的表达能力有限，而全局唯一标识符（UID）方法会引入虚假相关性，严重损害泛化性能。需要一种平衡表达力和泛化能力的新方法。

Method: 提出了基于d跳唯一性着色的局部UID方案，确保标识符仅在节点的d跳邻域内唯一。基于此设计了ColorGNN（通过颜色条件嵌入整合颜色信息）和ColorUID（轻量级特征级变体）。

Result: 实验表明该方法在三个ILP基准测试中取得显著提升，在线性规划数据集上表现出强大的OOD泛化能力，与最先进方法结合还能进一步提升图级任务的性能。

Conclusion: 局部UID方案在d层网络中能够达到全局UID的表达能力，同时提供更强的泛化性能，为ILP优化问题提供了有效的学习优化解决方案。

Abstract: Integer Linear Programs (ILPs) are central to real-world optimizations but
notoriously difficult to solve. Learning to Optimize (L2O) has emerged as a
promising paradigm, with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) serving as the standard
backbone. However, standard anonymous GNNs are limited in expressiveness for
ILPs, and the common enhancement of augmenting nodes with globally unique
identifiers (UIDs) typically introduces spurious correlations that severely
harm generalization. To address this tradeoff, we propose a parsimonious
Local-UID scheme based on d-hop uniqueness coloring, which ensures identifiers
are unique only within each node's d-hop neighborhood. Building on this scheme,
we introduce ColorGNN, which incorporates color information via
color-conditioned embeddings, and ColorUID, a lightweight feature-level
variant. We prove that for d-layer networks, Local-UIDs achieve the expressive
power of Global-UIDs while offering stronger generalization. Extensive
experiments show that our approach (i) yields substantial gains on three ILP
benchmarks, (ii) exhibits strong OOD generalization on linear programming
datasets, and (iii) further improves a general graph-level task when paired
with a state-of-the-art method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统时间序列模型评估主要关注预测、插补、异常检测和分类等任务，这些任务主要评估特定任务性能，但无法严格衡量模型是否真正捕捉到数据的完整生成分布。

Method: 提出了TSCom-Bench评估框架，将时间序列模型作为无损压缩的骨干网络进行快速适配，建立了标准化的评估协议和指标。

Result: 在多个数据集上对TimeXer、iTransformer、PatchTST等先进模型的实验表明，压缩能够揭示传统基准测试忽略的分布性弱点。

Conclusion: 无损压缩作为一个原则性任务，能够补充和扩展现有的时间序列建模评估方法，为模型能力提供更全面的衡量标准。

Abstract: The evaluation of time series models has traditionally focused on four
canonical tasks: forecasting, imputation, anomaly detection, and
classification. While these tasks have driven significant progress, they
primarily assess task-specific performance and do not rigorously measure
whether a model captures the full generative distribution of the data. We
introduce lossless compression as a new paradigm for evaluating time series
models, grounded in Shannon's source coding theorem. This perspective
establishes a direct equivalence between optimal compression length and the
negative log-likelihood, providing a strict and unified information-theoretic
criterion for modeling capacity. Then We define a standardized evaluation
protocol and metrics. We further propose and open-source a comprehensive
evaluation framework TSCom-Bench, which enables the rapid adaptation of time
series models as backbones for lossless compression. Experiments across diverse
datasets on state-of-the-art models, including TimeXer, iTransformer, and
PatchTST, demonstrate that compression reveals distributional weaknesses
overlooked by classic benchmarks. These findings position lossless compression
as a principled task that complements and extends existing evaluation for time
series modeling.

Motivation: 多智能体飞行轨迹预测对于理解空中交通流至关重要，但面临两大挑战：建模个体飞机行为随时间的变化以及航班间复杂交互，同时需要生成可解释的预测结果。

Conclusion: MAIFormer不仅预测性能优越，还能从人类视角产生可解释的预测结果，提高了模型的透明度和空中交通控制的实际效用。

Abstract: Flight trajectory prediction for multiple aircraft is essential and provides
critical insights into how aircraft navigate within current air traffic flows.
However, predicting multi-agent flight trajectories is inherently challenging.
One of the major difficulties is modeling both the individual aircraft
behaviors over time and the complex interactions between flights. Generating
explainable prediction outcomes is also a challenge. Therefore, we propose a
Multi-Agent Inverted Transformer, MAIFormer, as a novel neural architecture
that predicts multi-agent flight trajectories. The proposed framework features
two key attention modules: (i) masked multivariate attention, which captures
spatio-temporal patterns of individual aircraft, and (ii) agent attention,
which models the social patterns among multiple agents in complex air traffic
scenes. We evaluated MAIFormer using a real-world automatic dependent
surveillance-broadcast flight trajectory dataset from the terminal airspace of
Incheon International Airport in South Korea. The experimental results show
that MAIFormer achieves the best performance across multiple metrics and
outperforms other methods. In addition, MAIFormer produces prediction outcomes
that are interpretable from a human perspective, which improves both the
transparency of the model and its practical utility in air traffic control.

Abstract: The generation of high-quality candidate molecules remains a central
challenge in AI-driven drug design. Current phenotype-based and target-based
strategies each suffer limitations, either incurring high experimental costs or
overlook system-level cellular responses. To bridge this gap, we propose
ExMoIRL, a novel generative framework that synergistically integrates
phenotypic and target-specific cues for de novo molecular generation. The
phenotype-guided generator is first pretrained on expansive drug-induced
transcriptional profiles and subsequently fine-tuned via multi-objective
reinforcement learning (RL). Crucially, the reward function fuses docking
affinity and drug-likeness scores, augmented with ranking loss,
prior-likelihood regularization, and entropy maximization. The multi-objective
RL steers the model toward chemotypes that are simultaneously potent, diverse,
and aligned with the specified phenotypic effects. Extensive experiments
demonstrate ExMoIRL's superior performance over state-of-the-art
phenotype-based and target-based models across multiple well-characterized
targets. Our generated molecules exhibit favorable drug-like properties, high
target affinity, and inhibitory potency (IC50) against cancer cells. This
unified framework showcases the synergistic potential of combining
phenotype-guided and target-aware strategies, offering a more effective
solution for de novo drug discovery.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管上下文学习已成为基于现代语言模型的少样本学习范式，但其内部机制仍不明确。本文旨在通过信息移除的视角揭示ICL的工作机制。

Method: 通过设计度量标准测量隐藏状态，观察少样本ICL如何模拟任务导向的信息移除过程，并识别出诱导移除操作的关键注意力头（去噪头）。

Result: 实验表明，通过低秩滤波器选择性移除隐藏状态中的特定信息能有效引导语言模型专注于目标任务，而去噪头的消融实验导致ICL准确率显著下降。

Conclusion: 信息移除机制是ICL的关键机制，少样本演示通过选择性移除非选择性表示中的冗余信息来改善输出，这一发现为理解ICL提供了新视角。

Abstract: In-context Learning (ICL) is an emerging few-shot learning paradigm based on
modern Language Models (LMs), yet its inner mechanism remains unclear. In this
paper, we investigate the mechanism through a novel perspective of information
removal. Specifically, we demonstrate that in the zero-shot scenario, LMs
encode queries into non-selective representations in hidden states containing
information for all possible tasks, leading to arbitrary outputs without
focusing on the intended task, resulting in near-zero accuracy. Meanwhile, we
find that selectively removing specific information from hidden states by a
low-rank filter effectively steers LMs toward the intended task. Building on
these findings, by measuring the hidden states on carefully designed metrics,
we observe that few-shot ICL effectively simulates such task-oriented
information removal processes, selectively removing the redundant information
from entangled non-selective representations, and improving the output based on
the demonstrations, which constitutes a key mechanism underlying ICL. Moreover,
we identify essential attention heads inducing the removal operation, termed
Denoising Heads, which enables the ablation experiments blocking the
information removal operation from the inference, where the ICL accuracy
significantly degrades, especially when the correct label is absent from the
few-shot demonstrations, confirming both the critical role of the information
removal mechanism and denoising heads.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于预训练大语言模型成本高昂，需要利用小代理模型来优化数据集，但推理能力通常需要超过7B参数的大模型才能可靠出现，这带来了挑战

Method: rBridge通过加权负对数似然与任务对齐，使用前沿模型的推理轨迹作为黄金标签，让小代理模型更贴近预训练目标和目标任务

Result: rBridge在1B到32B规模上实现了最强的相关性，在1B到7B规模上实现了预测关系的零样本迁移，数据集排序成本比最佳基线降低100倍以上

Conclusion: rBridge为以更低成本探索面向推理的预训练提供了一条实用路径

Abstract: Given the prohibitive cost of pre-training large language models, it is
essential to leverage smaller proxy models to optimize datasets before scaling
up. However, this approach becomes challenging for reasoning capabilities,
which exhibit emergent behavior that only appear reliably at larger model
sizes, often exceeding 7B parameters. To address this, we introduce rBridge,
showing that small proxies ($\leq$1B) can effectively predict large-model
reasoning by aligning more closely with (1) the pre-training objective and (2)
the target task. rBridge achieves this by weighting negative log-likelihood
with task alignment, using reasoning traces from frontier models as gold
labels. In our experiments, rBridge (i) reduces dataset ranking costs by over
100x relative to the best baseline, (ii) achieves the strongest correlation
across six reasoning benchmarks at 1B to 32B scale, and (iii) zero-shot
transfers predictive relationships across pre-training datasets at 1B to 7B
scale. These findings indicate that rBridge offers a practical path for
exploring reasoning-oriented pre-training at lower cost.

Abstract: It remains an open question whether LLMs can acquire or generalize genuinely
new reasoning strategies, beyond the sharpened skills encoded in their
parameters during pre-training or post-training. To attempt to answer this
debate, we introduce DELTA-Code--Distributional Evaluation of Learnability and
Transferrability in Algorithmic Coding, a controlled benchmark of synthetic
coding problem families designed to probe two fundamental aspects: learnability
-- can LLMs, through reinforcement learning (RL), solve problem families where
pretrained models exhibit failure with large enough attempts (pass@K=0)? --and
transferrability -- if learnability happens, can such skills transfer
systematically to out-of-distribution (OOD) test sets? Unlike prior public
coding datasets, DELTA isolates reasoning skills through templated problem
generators and introduces fully OOD problem families that demand novel
strategies rather than tool invocation or memorized patterns. Our experiments
reveal a striking grokking phase transition: after an extended period with
near-zero reward, RL-trained models abruptly climb to near-perfect accuracy. To
enable learnability on previously unsolvable problem families, we explore key
training ingredients such as staged warm-up with dense rewards, experience
replay, curriculum training, and verification-in-the-loop. Beyond learnability,
we use DELTA to evaluate transferability or generalization along exploratory,
compositional, and transformative axes, as well as cross-family transfer.
Results show solid gains within families and for recomposed skills, but
persistent weaknesses in transformative cases. DELTA thus offers a clean
testbed for probing the limits of RL-driven reasoning and for understanding how
models can move beyond existing priors to acquire new algorithmic skills.

### [243] [Efficient Ensemble Conditional Independence Test Framework for Causal Discovery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21021)
*Zhengkang Guan,Kun Kuang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Ensemble Conditional Independence Test (E-CIT)框架，通过分治策略将数据分成子集，分别应用基础条件独立性测试，然后使用基于稳定分布特性的新方法聚合p值，显著降低计算复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于约束的因果发现依赖大量条件独立性测试(CITs)，但计算成本极高，特别是CITs本身对样本大小具有高时间复杂度，限制了实际应用。

Method: 采用分治策略：将数据划分为子集，对每个子集独立应用基础CIT，然后使用基于稳定分布特性的新方法聚合得到的p值。

Result: 实验结果表明，E-CIT不仅显著降低了CITs和因果发现的计算负担，而且实现了有竞争力的性能，特别是在复杂测试场景和真实世界数据集上表现出改进。

Conclusion: E-CIT是一个通用且即插即用的框架，将基础CIT的计算复杂度降低到样本大小的线性水平，同时在理论上具有一致性保证。

Abstract: Constraint-based causal discovery relies on numerous conditional independence
tests (CITs), but its practical applicability is severely constrained by the
prohibitive computational cost, especially as CITs themselves have high time
complexity with respect to the sample size. To address this key bottleneck, we
introduce the Ensemble Conditional Independence Test (E-CIT), a general and
plug-and-play framework. E-CIT operates on an intuitive divide-and-aggregate
strategy: it partitions the data into subsets, applies a given base CIT
independently to each subset, and aggregates the resulting p-values using a
novel method grounded in the properties of stable distributions. This framework
reduces the computational complexity of a base CIT to linear in the sample size
when the subset size is fixed. Moreover, our tailored p-value combination
method offers theoretical consistency guarantees under mild conditions on the
subtests. Experimental results demonstrate that E-CIT not only significantly
reduces the computational burden of CITs and causal discovery but also achieves
competitive performance. Notably, it exhibits an improvement in complex testing
scenarios, particularly on real-world datasets.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ACA是一种轻量级强化学习框架，通过消除显式行动者网络，直接从噪声级评论家的梯度场生成动作，简化了actor-critic方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的actor-critic方法依赖分离的行动者和评论家网络，训练复杂且对架构决策敏感；扩散模型虽能表达多模态行为但带来额外设计负担。

Method: 引入Actor-Critic without Actor框架，取消显式行动者网络，利用噪声级评论家的梯度场直接生成动作，保持策略改进与评论家价值估计紧密对齐。

Result: 在标准在线RL基准测试中，ACA相比标准actor-critic和扩散方法获得更优的学习曲线和竞争性性能。

Conclusion: ACA提供了一种简单而强大的在线RL解决方案，结合了简洁性和表达力，无需扩散型行动者即可捕捉多样化多模态行为。

Abstract: Actor-critic methods constitute a central paradigm in reinforcement learning
(RL), coupling policy evaluation with policy improvement. While effective
across many domains, these methods rely on separate actor and critic networks,
which makes training vulnerable to architectural decisions and hyperparameter
tuning. Such complexity limits their scalability in settings that require large
function approximators. Recently, diffusion models have recently been proposed
as expressive policies that capture multi-modal behaviors and improve
exploration, but they introduce additional design choices and computational
burdens, hindering efficient deployment. We introduce Actor-Critic without
Actor (ACA), a lightweight framework that eliminates the explicit actor network
and instead generates actions directly from the gradient field of a noise-level
critic. This design removes the algorithmic and computational overhead of actor
training while keeping policy improvement tightly aligned with the critic's
latest value estimates. Moreover, ACA retains the ability to capture diverse,
multi-modal behaviors without relying on diffusion-based actors, combining
simplicity with expressiveness. Through extensive experiments on standard
online RL benchmarks,ACA achieves more favorable learning curves and
competitive performance compared to both standard actor-critic and
state-of-the-art diffusion-based methods, providing a simple yet powerful
solution for online RL.

*Runqi Lin,Alasdair Paren,Suqin Yuan,Muyang Li,Philip Torr,Adel Bibi,Tongliang Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文分析了多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）的视觉越狱攻击，发现现有攻击方法在跨模型迁移时效果有限，主要原因是攻击位于高锐度区域。作者提出了FORCE方法，通过纠正对层特征和频谱特征的过度依赖，提高攻击的跨模型迁移能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前简单的视觉越狱攻击虽然能有效操纵开源MLLMs，但在跨模型迁移到闭源MLLMs时效果不佳，无法可靠识别闭源模型的漏洞。

Method: 提出FORCE方法：分析攻击的损失景观和特征表示，发现攻击过度依赖窄层表示和语义贫乏的频率分量；通过引导攻击探索更广泛的可行区域，并根据语义内容重新调整频率特征的影响。

Result: 实验表明，FORCE方法能够发现平坦的可行区域，显著提高视觉越狱攻击的跨模型迁移能力，有效促进对闭源MLLMs的红队评估。

Conclusion: 通过消除对层特征和频谱特征的非泛化依赖，FORCE方法成功提升了视觉越狱攻击的跨模型迁移性，为闭源MLLMs的安全评估提供了有效工具。

Abstract: The integration of new modalities enhances the capabilities of multimodal
large language models (MLLMs) but also introduces additional vulnerabilities.
In particular, simple visual jailbreaking attacks can manipulate open-source
MLLMs more readily than sophisticated textual attacks. However, these
underdeveloped attacks exhibit extremely limited cross-model transferability,
failing to reliably identify vulnerabilities in closed-source MLLMs. In this
work, we analyse the loss landscape of these jailbreaking attacks and find that
the generated attacks tend to reside in high-sharpness regions, whose
effectiveness is highly sensitive to even minor parameter changes during
transfer. To further explain the high-sharpness localisations, we analyse their
feature representations in both the intermediate layers and the spectral
domain, revealing an improper reliance on narrow layer representations and
semantically poor frequency components. Building on this, we propose a Feature
Over-Reliance CorrEction (FORCE) method, which guides the attack to explore
broader feasible regions across layer features and rescales the influence of
frequency features according to their semantic content. By eliminating
non-generalizable reliance on both layer and spectral features, our method
discovers flattened feasible regions for visual jailbreaking attacks, thereby
improving cross-model transferability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our approach effectively facilitates visual red-teaming evaluations against
closed-source MLLMs.

*Honglin Zhang,Qianyue Hao,Fengli Xu,Yong Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本研究通过边缘归因修补技术分析RL微调对LLM内部机制的影响，发现在线RL训练会增强激活强度和多样性，而DPO方法则表现出不同的内部变化模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管RL微调被证明能提升LLM能力，但其对不同LLM内部机制的具体影响仍不明确，需要深入探究RL微调如何改变模型内部信息流动。

Method: 使用边缘归因修补技术对比分析多个模型家族在RL微调前后的内部激活差异，重点关注PPO、GRPO和DPO等不同RL方法的效果。

Result: 在线RL微调导致两个稳定效应：激活强度整体增加（更多内部通路被激活）和激活模式多样性提高（更高熵值和更分散的边缘分布），而DPO方法的变化较弱或不一致。

Conclusion: RL微调通过重塑信息流动使其更具冗余性和灵活性来提升泛化能力，在线RL方法与基于偏好的方法在内部机制改变上存在显著差异。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) acquire extensive prior knowledge through
large-scale pretraining and can be further enhanced via supervised fine-tuning
(SFT) or reinforcement learning (RL)-based post-training. A growing body of
evidence has shown that RL fine-tuning improves the capability of LLMs beyond
what SFT alone achieves. However, the underlying mechanisms why RL fine-tuning
is able to enhance the capability of various LLMs with distinct intrinsic
characteristics remain underexplored. In this study, we draw inspiration from
prior work on edge attribution patching (EAP) to investigate the internal
differences of LLMs before and after RL fine-tuning. Our analysis across
multiple model families shows two robust effects of online RL post-training:
(i) an overall increase in activation intensity, indicating that more internal
pathways are engaged and their signals become stronger, and (ii) greater
diversity in activation patterns, reflected by higher entropy and less
concentrated edge distributions. These changes suggest that RL reshapes
information flow to be both more redundant and more flexible, which may explain
its advantage in generalization. Notably, models fine-tuned with Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO) deviate from these trends, exhibiting
substantially weaker or inconsistent internal changes compared to PPO- and
GRPO-based training. Together, our findings provide a unified view of how RL
fine-tuning systematically alters the internal circuitry of LLMs and highlight
the methodological distinctions between online RL and preference-based
approaches. Our code is open source at

TL;DR: 本文提出了几何问题中的指称表达理解任务，并构建了GeoRef基准数据集，通过监督微调和GRPO方法提升模型在几何图理解上的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 几何问题求解需要准确的图表理解和跨模态对齐能力，但目前缺乏专门评估模型在几何图中定位和解释几何元素能力的方法。

Method: 使用结构化几何形式语言生成大规模合成训练数据，采用SFT和GRPO两种微调方法，并提出验证-再生机制来纠正错误预测。

Result: GRPO方法显著优于SFT，验证-再生机制进一步提升了准确率。即使最先进的MLLM模型在该任务上表现不佳，说明需要专门加强几何基础能力。

Conclusion: GeoRef数据集和提出的方法有效提升了模型的几何理解能力，这种指称表达理解任务为多模态数学理解提供了重要基础。

Abstract: AI-driven geometric problem solving is a complex vision-language task that
requires accurate diagram interpretation, mathematical reasoning, and robust
cross-modal grounding. A foundational yet underexplored capability for this
task is the ability to identify and interpret geometric elements based on
natural language queries. To address this, we introduce the task of Referring
Expression Comprehension (REC) for geometric problems, which evaluates whether
models can localize points, shapes, and spatial relations in diagrams in
response to textual prompts. We present GeoRef, a benchmark dataset constructed
from existing geometric problem corpora, featuring diverse, high-quality
annotations and queries. Due to the lack of annotated data for this task, we
generate a large-scale synthetic training dataset using a structured geometric
formal language, enabling broad coverage of geometric concepts and facilitating
model adaptation. We explore two fine-tuning approaches: Supervised Fine-Tuning
(SFT) and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Our results show that GRPO
significantly outperforms SFT by better aligning model behavior with
task-specific rewards. Furthermore, we propose a verify-and-regenerate
mechanism that detects incorrect predictions and re-infers answers using
contextual reasoning history, further boosting accuracy. Notably, even
state-of-the-art Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) struggle with this
task, underscoring the necessity of explicitly evaluating and strengthening
geometric grounding as a prerequisite for robust geometric problem solving.
Moreover, models trained on GeoRef demonstrate measurable improvements on
downstream geometric reasoning tasks, highlighting the broader value of REC as
a foundation for multimodal mathematical understanding.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ScaleDiff是一个简单有效的管道，用于大规模创建困难数学问题，通过自适应思维模型识别现有数据集中的难题，并训练专门的难题生成器，显著提升了模型在数学推理任务上的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在自动合成数学问题时面临高计算成本、复杂提示和生成问题难度有限的挑战，需要一种更高效的方式来扩展困难问题的创建。

Method: 提出ScaleDiff管道：1）使用自适应思维模型单次前向传播识别现有数据集中的难题；2）在筛选的困难数据上训练专门的难题生成器DiffGen-8B；3）在ScaleDiff-Math数据集上微调Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Instruct模型。

Result: 在Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Instruct模型上微调后，性能比原始数据集提升11.3%，在AIME'24、AIME'25等五个困难数学基准上达到65.9%的平均准确率，超越了OpenThinker3等强模型。

Conclusion: ScaleDiff管道能够有效扩展困难问题的创建，显著提升模型推理能力，且仅使用成本效益高的Qwen3-8B作为教师模型，证明了无需依赖更大更昂贵模型即可转移高级推理能力。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have shown impressive capabilities in complex
problem-solving, often benefiting from training on difficult mathematical
problems that stimulate intricate reasoning. Recent efforts have explored
automated synthesis of mathematical problems by prompting proprietary models or
large-scale open-source models from seed data or inherent mathematical
concepts. However, scaling up these methods remains challenging due to their
high computational/API cost, complexity of prompting, and limited difficulty
level of the generated problems. To overcome these limitations, we propose
ScaleDiff, a simple yet effective pipeline designed to scale the creation of
difficult problems. We efficiently identify difficult problems from existing
datasets with only a single forward pass using an adaptive thinking model,
which can perceive problem difficulty and automatically switch between
"Thinking" and "NoThinking" modes. We then train a specialized difficult
problem generator (DiffGen-8B) on this filtered difficult data, which can
produce new difficult problems in large scale, eliminating the need for
complex, per-instance prompting and its associated high API costs. Fine-tuning
Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Instruct on the ScaleDiff-Math dataset yields a substantial
performance increase of 11.3% compared to the original dataset and achieves a
65.9% average accuracy on AIME'24, AIME'25, HMMT-Feb'25, BRUMO'25, and MATH500,
outperforming recent strong LRMs like OpenThinker3. Notably, this performance
is achieved using the cost-efficient Qwen3-8B model as a teacher, demonstrating
that our pipeline can effectively transfer advanced reasoning capabilities
without relying on larger, more expensive teacher models. Furthermore, we
observe a clear scaling phenomenon in model performance on difficult benchmarks
as the quantity of difficult problems increases. Code:

TL;DR: SPREAD是一个基于去噪扩散概率模型的生成框架，用于高效计算多目标优化问题的帕累托集，特别适用于大规模和计算昂贵的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发高效的多目标优化方法来计算冲突目标之间的帕累托最优折衷集仍然是一个关键挑战，尤其是对于大规模和计算昂贵的问题。

Method: SPREAD首先学习决策空间中采样点的条件扩散过程，然后在每个反向扩散步骤中，通过使用自适应多梯度下降启发的更新进行快速收敛，并结合基于高斯RBF的排斥项来保持多样性，从而细化候选解。

Result: 在多目标优化基准测试（包括离线和基于贝叶斯代理的设置）上的实证结果表明，SPREAD在效率、可扩展性和帕累托前沿覆盖方面匹配或超过了领先的基线方法。

Conclusion: SPREAD框架通过结合扩散模型和优化技术，为大规模多目标优化问题提供了一种有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Developing efficient multi-objective optimization methods to compute the
Pareto set of optimal compromises between conflicting objectives remains a key
challenge, especially for large-scale and expensive problems. To bridge this
gap, we introduce SPREAD, a generative framework based on Denoising Diffusion
Probabilistic Models (DDPMs). SPREAD first learns a conditional diffusion
process over points sampled from the decision space and then, at each reverse
diffusion step, refines candidates via a sampling scheme that uses an adaptive
multiple gradient descent-inspired update for fast convergence alongside a
Gaussian RBF-based repulsion term for diversity. Empirical results on
multi-objective optimization benchmarks, including offline and Bayesian
surrogate-based settings, show that SPREAD matches or exceeds leading baselines
in efficiency, scalability, and Pareto front coverage.

TL;DR: SATMC是一种新颖的图域自适应框架，通过图结构和属性变换来顺序对齐网络间的分布，解决了传统方法在处理结构异质性时的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的图域自适应方法主要关注在原始图结构上变换节点属性，并跨网络对齐变换后的节点特征分布。但这些方法往往难以处理不同图域之间的结构异质性，导致分布对齐效果不佳。

Method: SATMC框架通过图结构和属性变换顺序对齐网络分布，引入了私有域信息减少机制和经验Wasserstein距离来减轻域私有信息的负面影响并增强模型泛化能力。

Result: 在9对公开跨域数据集上的广泛实验表明，SATMC在跨网络节点分类任务中优于现有最先进的方法。理论证明SATMC能够实现比现有图域自适应方法更紧的误差界。

Conclusion: SATMC通过同时考虑图结构和属性变换，有效解决了图域自适应中的结构异质性问题，在跨网络节点分类任务中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Graph domain adaptation has gained significant attention in label-scarce
scenarios across different graph domains. Traditional approaches to graph
domain adaptation primarily focus on transforming node attributes over raw
graph structures and aligning the distributions of the transformed node
features across networks. However, these methods often struggle with the
underlying structural heterogeneity between distinct graph domains, which leads
to suboptimal distribution alignment. To address this limitation, we propose
Structure-Attribute Transformation with Markov Chain (SATMC), a novel framework
that sequentially aligns distributions across networks via both graph structure
and attribute transformations. To mitigate the negative influence of
domain-private information and further enhance the model's generalization,
SATMC introduces a private domain information reduction mechanism and an
empirical Wasserstein distance. Theoretical proofs suggest that SATMC can
achieve a tighter error bound for cross-network node classification compared to
existing graph domain adaptation methods. Extensive experiments on nine pairs
of publicly available cross-domain datasets show that SATMC outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in the cross-network node classification task. The
code is available at https://github.com/GiantZhangYT/SATMC.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TyphoonMLA是一种混合注意力机制，结合了naive和absorb两种方法的优势，在MLA架构中实现了高达3倍的注意力计算吞吐量提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的MLA注意力机制在解码阶段使用absorb方法虽然减少了HBM带宽使用，但其计算密集型特性无法充分利用注意力计算中的数据重用机会（如共享前缀），限制了性能提升。

Method: TyphoonMLA采用混合方法：对注意力计算的计算密集型部分使用naive公式以利用共享前缀，对非共享部分使用absorb公式以减少带宽需求。

Result: 在NPU和GPU上，TyphoonMLA将MLA架构的注意力计算吞吐量分别提升了3倍和3.24倍，HBM大小仅增加3%。

Conclusion: TyphoonMLA通过巧妙结合两种注意力计算方法，有效平衡了计算效率和带宽使用，为MLA架构提供了显著的性能优化方案。

Abstract: Multi-Head Latent Attention (MLA) is a recent attention mechanism adopted in
state-of-the-art LLMs such as DeepSeek-v3 and Kimi K2. Thanks to its novel
formulation, MLA allows two functionally equivalent but computationally
distinct kernel implementations: naive and absorb. While the naive kernels
(e.g., FlashAttention) are typically preferred in training and prefill for
their computational efficiency, existing decoding kernels (e.g., FlashMLA) rely
on the absorb method to minimize HBM bandwidth usage. However, the
compute-bound nature of the absorb implementations prohibits performance
benefits from data reuse opportunities in attention calculations, such as
shared prefixes. In this work, we introduce TyphoonMLA, a hybrid approach that
combines naive and absorb formulations to harness the strengths of both.
TyphoonMLA effectively leverages the shared prefix by applying the naive
formulation to the compute-bound parts of attention calculations, while
reducing the bandwidth requirements for non-shared parts by using the absorb
formulation. As a result, TyphoonMLA improves the throughput of attention
calculations in MLA architectures by up to 3x and 3.24x on NPU and GPUs, with
only a 3% overhead in HBM size.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决图学习中模型如何泛化到新图的问题，现有方法局限于单图传导式设置，缺乏对归纳泛化的系统评估。

Method: 生成具有持久语义社区的图家族，控制结构属性如同质性和度分布，实现对分布偏移的鲁棒性测试。

Result: 基准测试显示传导性能不能预测归纳泛化能力，鲁棒性对模型架构和初始图状态高度敏感。

Conclusion: GraphUniverse的灵活性和可扩展性有助于开发真正可泛化的图架构，包括下一代图基础模型。

Abstract: A fundamental challenge in graph learning is understanding how models
generalize to new, unseen graphs. While synthetic benchmarks offer controlled
settings for analysis, existing approaches are confined to single-graph,
transductive settings where models train and test on the same graph structure.
Addressing this gap, we introduce GraphUniverse, a framework for generating
entire families of graphs to enable the first systematic evaluation of
inductive generalization at scale. Our core innovation is the generation of
graphs with persistent semantic communities, ensuring conceptual consistency
while allowing fine-grained control over structural properties like homophily
and degree distributions. This enables crucial but underexplored robustness
tests, such as performance under controlled distribution shifts. Benchmarking a
wide range of architectures -- from GNNs to graph transformers and topological
architectures -- reveals that strong transductive performance is a poor
predictor of inductive generalization. Furthermore, we find that robustness to
distribution shift is highly sensitive not only to model architecture choice
but also to the initial graph regime (e.g., high vs. low homophily). Beyond
benchmarking, GraphUniverse's flexibility and scalability can facilitate the
development of robust and truly generalizable architectures -- including
next-generation graph foundation models. An interactive demo is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线强化学习在复杂任务中耗时且需要大量交互步骤。视觉语言动作策略在解决多样化任务方面有潜力，但在低层控制方面性能有限，且通常需要任务特定的专家演示进行微调。

Method: VARL框架利用视觉语言模型的领域知识为强化学习代理提供动作建议，而不是设计启发式奖励，从而保证最优性和收敛性不变。建议的动作增加了样本多样性。

Result: 在不同环境和代理设置下的评估显示，VARL显著提高了样本效率，且没有引入显著的计算开销。

Conclusion: VARL是一个通用的在线强化学习框架，使得在真实世界环境中直接从零开始应用强化学习变得可行。

Abstract: Online reinforcement learning in complex tasks is time-consuming, as massive
interaction steps are needed to learn the optimal Q-function.Vision-language
action (VLA) policies represent a promising direction for solving diverse
tasks; however, their performance on low-level control remains limited, and
effective deployment often requires task-specific expert demonstrations for
fine-tuning. In this paper, we propose \textbf{VARL} (\textbf{V}LM as
\textbf{A}ction advisor for online \textbf{R}einforcement \textbf{L}earning), a
framework that leverages the domain knowledge of vision-language models (VLMs)
to provide action suggestions for reinforcement learning agents. Unlike
previous methods, VARL provides action suggestions rather than designing
heuristic rewards, thereby guaranteeing unchanged optimality and convergence.
The suggested actions increase sample diversity and ultimately improve sample
efficiency, especially in sparse-reward tasks. To validate the effectiveness of
VARL, we evaluate it across diverse environments and agent settings. Results
show that VARL greatly improves sample efficiency without introducing
significant computational overhead. These advantages make VARL a general
framework for online reinforcement learning and make it feasible to directly
apply reinforcement learning from scratch in real-world environments.

TL;DR: EvoMail是一个自进化的认知代理框架，通过构建统一的异构邮件图，结合认知图神经网络和大型语言模型进行上下文感知推理，并采用红蓝队对抗自进化机制来持续适应新型垃圾邮件和钓鱼攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代垃圾邮件和钓鱼攻击已超越传统关键词黑名单和简单启发式方法，采用多模态策略并快速演化，传统基于静态规则或单模态模型的检测系统难以整合异构信号和持续适应，导致性能快速下降。

Method: 构建统一的异构邮件图融合文本内容、元数据和嵌入资源；使用认知图神经网络增强LLM进行上下文感知推理；采用红蓝队对抗自进化循环，红队生成新型规避策略，蓝队从失败中学习并压缩经验到记忆模块。

Result: 在真实数据集和合成对抗变体上的广泛实验表明，EvoMail在检测精度、对演化垃圾邮件策略的适应性和推理可解释性方面持续优于最先进的基线方法。

Conclusion: EvoMail作为对抗下一代垃圾邮件和钓鱼威胁的弹性和可解释防御框架具有重要潜力。

Abstract: Modern email spam and phishing attacks have evolved far beyond keyword
blacklists or simple heuristics. Adversaries now craft multi-modal campaigns
that combine natural-language text with obfuscated URLs, forged headers, and
malicious attachments, adapting their strategies within days to bypass filters.
Traditional spam detection systems, which rely on static rules or
single-modality models, struggle to integrate heterogeneous signals or to
continuously adapt, leading to rapid performance degradation.
  We propose EvoMail, a self-evolving cognitive agent framework for robust
detection of spam and phishing. EvoMail first constructs a unified
heterogeneous email graph that fuses textual content, metadata (headers,
senders, domains), and embedded resources (URLs, attachments). A Cognitive
Graph Neural Network enhanced by a Large Language Model (LLM) performs
context-aware reasoning across these sources to identify coordinated spam
campaigns. Most critically, EvoMail engages in an adversarial self-evolution
loop: a ''red-team'' agent generates novel evasion tactics -- such as character
obfuscation or AI-generated phishing text -- while the ''blue-team'' detector
learns from failures, compresses experiences into a memory module, and reuses
them for future reasoning.
  Extensive experiments on real-world datasets (Enron-Spam, Ling-Spam,
SpamAssassin, and TREC) and synthetic adversarial variants demonstrate that
EvoMail consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in detection
accuracy, adaptability to evolving spam tactics, and interpretability of
reasoning traces. These results highlight EvoMail's potential as a resilient
and explainable defense framework against next-generation spam and phishing
threats.

Motivation: 深度神经网络在图像分类任务中表现出色，但对精心设计的对抗性扰动仍然脆弱。作者希望探索线性降维作为一种简单、数据自适应的防御方法。

Method: 使用稀疏主成分分析(SPCA)和标准PCA作为前端特征提取器，结合下游分类器进行实验比较。理论分析包括推导SPCA特征的线性分类器的精确鲁棒性证书，以及通过Lipschitz组合论证分析稀疏性对非线性分类器的影响。

Result: 实验表明，在强白盒和黑盒攻击下，SPCA比PCA表现更稳健，同时保持竞争力的干净准确率。理论分析确认了稀疏投影减少对抗性杠杆的机制。

Conclusion: 稀疏主成分分析通过减少投影的稀疏性来降低对抗性攻击的敏感性，这一机制在理论和实验中都得到了验证，为对抗性防御提供了一种简单有效的方法。

revisits linear dimensionality reduction as a simple, data-adapted defense. We
empirically compare standard Principal Component Analysis (PCA) with its sparse
variant (SPCA) as front-end feature extractors for downstream classifiers, and
we complement these experiments with a theoretical analysis. On the theory
side, we derive exact robustness certificates for linear heads applied to SPCA
features: for both $\ell_\infty$ and $\ell_2$ threat models (binary and
multiclass), the certified radius grows as the dual norms of $W^\top u$ shrink,
where $W$ is the projection and $u$ the head weights. We further show that for
general (non-linear) heads, sparsity reduces operator-norm bounds through a
Lipschitz composition argument, predicting lower input sensitivity.
Empirically, with a small non-linear network after the projection, SPCA
consistently degrades more gracefully than PCA under strong white-box and
black-box attacks while maintaining competitive clean accuracy. Taken together,
the theory identifies the mechanism (sparser projections reduce adversarial
leverage) and the experiments verify that this benefit persists beyond the
linear setting. Our code is available at

*Ivan Stresec,Joana P. Gonçalves*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LAVA是一种后处理模型无关方法，用于解释无监督黑盒模型的局部嵌入结构，通过分析输入特征与潜在空间邻域的相关性来揭示特征关联模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无监督黑盒模型虽然能驱动科学发现，但难以解释。现有解释方法要么过于细粒度要么过于简化，无法有效揭示潜在空间的组织结构。

Method: LAVA将潜在空间表示为一系列邻域，通过分析原始特征之间的相关性来描述这些邻域，然后揭示整个潜在空间中重复出现的相关性模式。

Result: 在MNIST和单细胞肾脏数据集的UMAP嵌入上，LAVA能够捕捉到相关的特征关联，在看似遥远的潜在空间区域之间发现视觉和生物学相关的局部模式。

Conclusion: LAVA提供了一种有效的方法来解释无监督学习中的局部嵌入组织，有助于理解复杂数据的内在结构。

Abstract: Unsupervised black-box models can be drivers of scientific discovery, but
remain difficult to interpret. Crucially, discovery hinges on understanding the
model output, which is often a multi-dimensional latent embedding rather than a
well-defined target. While explainability for supervised learning usually seeks
to uncover how input features are used to predict a target, its unsupervised
counterpart should relate input features to the structure of the learned latent
space. Adaptations of supervised model explainability for unsupervised learning
provide either single-sample or dataset-wide summary explanations. However,
without automated strategies of relating similar samples to one another guided
by their latent proximity, explanations remain either too fine-grained or too
reductive to be meaningful. This is especially relevant for manifold learning
methods that produce no mapping function, leaving us only with the relative
spatial organization of their embeddings. We introduce Locality-Aware Variable
Associations (LAVA), a post-hoc model-agnostic method designed to explain local
embedding organization through its relationship with the input features. To
achieve this, LAVA represents the latent space as a series of localities
(neighborhoods) described in terms of correlations between the original
features, and then reveals reoccurring patterns of correlations across the
entire latent space. Based on UMAP embeddings of MNIST and a single-cell kidney
dataset, we show that LAVA captures relevant feature associations, with
visually and biologically relevant local patterns shared among seemingly
distant regions of the latent spaces.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出CAD-Tokenizer，一种针对CAD数据的多模态分词框架，通过序列化VQ-VAE实现原始级池化和约束解码，显著提升了文本引导CAD原型设计的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LLM分词器将CAD序列分解为自然语言词片段，无法捕捉CAD的原始级语义和几何结构，限制了文本引导CAD原型设计的发展。

Method: 采用基于序列的VQ-VAE，结合原始级池化和约束解码策略，生成紧凑且原始感知的CAD数据表示。

Result: CAD-Tokenizer在统一文本引导CAD原型设计中显著改善了指令跟随和生成质量，在定量和定性评估上均优于通用LLM和任务专用基线。

Conclusion: 多模态分词策略与CAD的原始和结构特性对齐，能够提供更有效的表示，为文本引导CAD设计流程提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: Computer-Aided Design (CAD) is a foundational component of industrial
prototyping, where models are defined not by raw coordinates but by
construction sequences such as sketches and extrusions. This sequential
structure enables both efficient prototype initialization and subsequent
editing. Text-guided CAD prototyping, which unifies Text-to-CAD generation and
CAD editing, has the potential to streamline the entire design pipeline.
However, prior work has not explored this setting, largely because standard
large language model (LLM) tokenizers decompose CAD sequences into
natural-language word pieces, failing to capture primitive-level CAD semantics
and hindering attention modules from modeling geometric structure. We
conjecture that a multimodal tokenization strategy, aligned with CAD's
primitive and structural nature, can provide more effective representations. To
this end, we propose CAD-Tokenizer, a framework that represents CAD data with
modality-specific tokens using a sequence-based VQ-VAE with primitive-level
pooling and constrained decoding. This design produces compact, primitive-aware
representations that align with CAD's structural nature. Applied to unified
text-guided CAD prototyping, CAD-Tokenizer significantly improves instruction
following and generation quality, achieving better quantitative and qualitative
performance over both general-purpose LLMs and task-specific baselines.

*Michael Sullivan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文证明了GRPO强化学习算法在特定假设下会诱导出非平凡的过程奖励模型（PRM），并通过实证验证这些假设在现实条件下成立。作者识别了GRPO目标的一个缺陷，并提出λ-GRPO改进算法，在保持训练成本基本不变的情况下显著提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究GRPO算法中隐含的过程奖励模型结构，探索是否可以利用这种内置结构来替代昂贵的人工定义PRM，从而在保持训练效率的同时提升模型性能。

Method: 首先理论证明GRPO会诱导PRM的存在，然后通过实证验证理论假设。识别GRPO目标的缺陷（非均匀分布过程步骤阻碍探索和利用），提出λ-GRPO改进算法来缓解这一问题。

Result: λ-GRPO训练的LLM在验证准确率和下游推理任务上的表现均优于标准GRPO，且达到峰值性能更快。实验表明可以利用GRPO的内置PRM结构来提升性能，而无需额外的高成本PRM定义。

Conclusion: 研究质疑了为GRPO使用昂贵显式定义PRM的优势，证明可以利用GRPO算法中隐藏的内置PRM结构来显著提升模型性能，且对训练时间和成本影响极小。

Abstract: We prove theoretically that the GRPO RL algorithm induces a non-trivial
process reward model (PRM), under certain assumptions regarding within-group
overlap of token sequences across completions. We then show empirically that
these assumptions are met under real-world conditions: GRPO does in fact induce
a non-trivial PRM. Leveraging the framework of GRPO-as-a-PRM, we identify a
flaw in the GRPO objective: non-uniformly distributed process steps hinder both
exploration and exploitation (under different conditions). We propose a simple
modification to the algorithm to mitigate this defect ($\lambda$-GRPO), and
show that LLMs trained with $\lambda$-GRPO achieve higher validation accuracy
and performance on downstream reasoning tasks$-$and reach peak performance more
rapidly$-$than LLMs trained with standard GRPO. Our results call into question
the advantage of costly, explicitly-defined PRMs for GRPO: we show that it is
possible to instead leverage the hidden, built-in PRM structure within the
vanilla GRPO algorithm to boost model performance with a negligible impact on
training time and cost.

*Giuseppe Serra,Florian Buettner*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为DATS（Distance-Aware Temperature Scaling）的新方法，用于解决持续学习中的校准问题，通过距离感知的温度缩放来适应不同任务，减少校准误差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在持续学习中，现有方法主要从数据角度解决校准问题，使用单一温度参数，忽视了任务间的差异，导致不同任务的校准误差波动较大。本文认为应根据任务距离自适应调整温度，但在测试时缺乏任务信息是一个挑战。

Method: 提出DATS方法，结合基于原型的距离估计和距离感知校准，推断任务接近度并分配自适应温度，无需先验任务信息。

Result: 在标准基准和真实世界不平衡生物医学数据集上的广泛实验表明，DATS方法在减少跨任务校准误差方面比现有方法更稳定、可靠和一致。

Conclusion: DATS方法通过距离感知的温度缩放有效解决了持续学习中的校准问题，提高了模型在不同任务上的校准性能。

Abstract: Continual Learning (CL) is recently gaining increasing attention for its
ability to enable a single model to learn incrementally from a sequence of new
classes. In this scenario, it is important to keep consistent predictive
performance across all the classes and prevent the so-called Catastrophic
Forgetting (CF). However, in safety-critical applications, predictive
performance alone is insufficient. Predictive models should also be able to
reliably communicate their uncertainty in a calibrated manner - that is, with
confidence scores aligned to the true frequencies of target events. Existing
approaches in CL address calibration primarily from a data-centric perspective,
relying on a single temperature shared across all tasks. Such solutions
overlook task-specific differences, leading to large fluctuations in
calibration error across tasks. For this reason, we argue that a more
principled approach should adapt the temperature according to the distance to
the current task. However, the unavailability of the task information at test
time/during deployment poses a major challenge to achieve the intended
objective. For this, we propose Distance-Aware Temperature Scaling (DATS),
which combines prototype-based distance estimation with distance-aware
calibration to infer task proximity and assign adaptive temperatures without
prior task information. Through extensive empirical evaluation on both standard
benchmarks and real-world, imbalanced datasets taken from the biomedical
domain, our approach demonstrates to be stable, reliable and consistent in
reducing calibration error across tasks compared to state-of-the-art
approaches.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个基于f-散度的统一框架，用于文本到图像扩散模型的机器遗忘，超越了传统的均方误差方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本到图像模型遗忘方法主要依赖均方误差最小化，但这种方法只是f-散度的一个特例，缺乏灵活性。

Method: 提出了一个统一的f-散度框架，允许选择不同的散度函数来平衡遗忘效果和概念保留。

Result: 分析表明不同f-散度影响算法收敛性和遗忘质量，提供了更灵活的权衡选择。

Conclusion: 该框架为特定应用选择最优散度提供了灵活范式，在激进遗忘和概念保留之间实现更好平衡。

Abstract: Machine unlearning aims to remove specific knowledge from a trained model.
While diffusion models (DMs) have shown remarkable generative capabilities,
existing unlearning methods for text-to-image (T2I) models often rely on
minimizing the mean squared error (MSE) between the output distribution of a
target and an anchor concept. We show that this MSE-based approach is a special
case of a unified $f$-divergence-based framework, in which any $f$-divergence
can be utilized. We analyze the benefits of using different $f$-divergences,
that mainly impact the convergence properties of the algorithm and the quality
of unlearning. The proposed unified framework offers a flexible paradigm that
allows to select the optimal divergence for a specific application, balancing
different trade-offs between aggressive unlearning and concept preservation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MoT是一种简单的方法，用于在异构专家模型之间进行潜在层面的协作，通过轻量级路由器选择专家并在共享潜在空间中执行交叉注意力，实现单次推理且无需迭代聚合开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开源大语言模型越来越专业化，需要利用不同模型的互补优势。现有方法要么路由到少数专家独立生成，要么通过多轮交换聚合输出，要么融合权重但需要架构同质性。

Method: 为每个查询，轻量级路由器选择top-K专家并指定主专家；交互层将隐藏状态投影到共享潜在空间，主专家对活跃同行执行交叉注意力。预训练专家保持冻结，仅训练路由器和交互层。

Result: 在5个分布内和3个分布外基准测试中，MoT超越了当前最先进的路由和聚合方法Avengers，分别提升+0.38%和+2.92%，且显著优于最佳单模型。

Conclusion: MoT为组合异构LLMs提供了一种简单的潜在空间机制，是迈向更广泛多LLM协作的实用步骤。

Abstract: Open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly specialize by domain
(e.g., math, code, general reasoning), motivating systems that leverage
complementary strengths across models. Prior multi-LLM approaches either (i)
route a query to one or a few experts and generate independently, (ii)
aggregate outputs from each model via costly multi-turn exchanges, or (iii)
fuse weights into a single model-typically requiring architectural homogeneity.
We introduce Mixture of Thoughts (MoT), a simple method for latent-level
collaboration among heterogeneous experts under a global routing scheme. For
each query, a lightweight router selects top-$K$ experts and designates a
primary expert; uniformly placed interaction layers project hidden states into
a shared latent space where the primary expert performs cross-attention over
its active (selected) peers. Pre-trained experts remain frozen; only the router
and the lightweight interaction layers are trained with a novel joint training
objective that improves both the expert selection and inter-expert
collaboration. Across five in-distribution (ID) and three out-of-distribution
(OOD) benchmarks, MoT surpasses the current routing and aggregation-based
state-of-the-art, Avengers, by $+0.38\%$ and $+2.92\%$, respectively. Further,
MoT significantly outperforms the best-performing single model. It achieves
this with single-pass inference, runtime comparable to routing baselines, and
none of the overheads of iterative aggregation. MoT offers a simple
latent-space mechanism for combining heterogeneous LLMs, a practical step
toward broader multi-LLM collaboration. Our code is publicly available at

Motivation: 现有深度学习方法特别是神经算子在湍流长期预测中表现不佳，无法同时捕捉湍流动力学的局部耗散效应和全局非局部相互作用这两种不同的数学结构。

Method: DINO框架通过并行分支分别学习局部微分算子（约束卷积网络）和全局积分算子（Transformer架构），实现物理驱动的算子分解。

Conclusion: DINO为物理一致的长期湍流预测建立了新基准，展示了基于物理原理的算子分解方法的优越稳定性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Accurately forecasting the long-term evolution of turbulence represents a
grand challenge in scientific computing and is crucial for applications ranging
from climate modeling to aerospace engineering. Existing deep learning methods,
particularly neural operators, often fail in long-term autoregressive
predictions, suffering from catastrophic error accumulation and a loss of
physical fidelity. This failure stems from their inability to simultaneously
capture the distinct mathematical structures that govern turbulent dynamics:
local, dissipative effects and global, non-local interactions. In this paper,
we propose the
{\textbf{\underline{D}}}ifferential-{\textbf{\underline{I}}}ntegral
{\textbf{\underline{N}}}eural {\textbf{\underline{O}}}perator (\method{}), a
novel framework designed from a first-principles approach of operator
decomposition. \method{} explicitly models the turbulent evolution through
parallel branches that learn distinct physical operators: a local differential
operator, realized by a constrained convolutional network that provably
converges to a derivative, and a global integral operator, captured by a
Transformer architecture that learns a data-driven global kernel. This
physics-based decomposition endows \method{} with exceptional stability and
robustness. Through extensive experiments on the challenging 2D Kolmogorov flow
benchmark, we demonstrate that \method{} significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art models in long-term forecasting. It successfully suppresses
error accumulation over hundreds of timesteps, maintains high fidelity in both
the vorticity fields and energy spectra, and establishes a new benchmark for
physically consistent, long-range turbulence forecast.

*Lars van der Laan,Nathan Kallus,Aurélien Bibaut*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的逆向强化学习方法，将最大熵IRL简化为两个现成的监督学习问题：概率分类来估计行为策略，以及迭代回归来解决固定点方程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的最大熵IRL方法涉及复杂的内循环优化、重复动态规划或对抗训练，这些方法限制了现代高表达能力函数逼近器（如神经网络）的使用。

Method: 通过将IRL问题重新表述为线性固定点方程，将其分解为两个监督学习任务：1）使用概率分类估计行为策略；2）使用迭代回归求解固定点方程。

Result: 该方法简单、模块化，在不同函数逼近类和算法中通用。实验结果显示其性能与MaxEnt IRL相当或更优。

Conclusion: 该方法为IRL提供了一种更简单有效的替代方案，特别适合现代函数逼近器的使用，具有理论保证和实际优势。

Abstract: Inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) aims to explain observed behavior by
uncovering an underlying reward. In the maximum-entropy or
Gumbel-shocks-to-reward frameworks, this amounts to fitting a reward function
and a soft value function that together satisfy the soft Bellman consistency
condition and maximize the likelihood of observed actions. While this
perspective has had enormous impact in imitation learning for robotics and
understanding dynamic choices in economics, practical learning algorithms often
involve delicate inner-loop optimization, repeated dynamic programming, or
adversarial training, all of which complicate the use of modern, highly
expressive function approximators like neural nets and boosting. We revisit
softmax IRL and show that the population maximum-likelihood solution is
characterized by a linear fixed-point equation involving the behavior policy.
This observation reduces IRL to two off-the-shelf supervised learning problems:
probabilistic classification to estimate the behavior policy, and iterative
regression to solve the fixed point. The resulting method is simple and modular
across function approximation classes and algorithms. We provide a precise
characterization of the optimal solution, a generic oracle-based algorithm,
finite-sample error bounds, and empirical results showing competitive or
superior performance to MaxEnt IRL.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解过参数化线性回归中ℓp插值器的参数范数如何随样本量缩放，这是一个基本但未解决的问题，对于理解泛化性能至关重要。

Method: 使用对偶射线分析，分析X⊤Y中信号尖峰和零坐标的竞争，得到闭合形式的预测，包括数据依赖的转折点n⋆和通用阈值r⋆=2(p-1)。

Result: 统一解决了r∈[1,p]范围内所有ℓr范数的缩放问题，揭示了哪些范数会饱和、哪些会继续增长，并将结果推广到对角线性网络。

Conclusion: 不同ℓr范数对泛化代理指标的预测能力存在敏感差异，这为理解显式和隐式偏置之间的联系提供了预测桥梁。

Abstract: For overparameterized linear regression with isotropic Gaussian design and
minimum-$\ell_p$ interpolator $p\in(1,2]$, we give a unified, high-probability
characterization for the scaling of the family of parameter norms $ \\{ \lVert
\widehat{w_p} \rVert_r \\}_{r \in [1,p]} $ with sample size.
  We solve this basic, but unresolved question through a simple dual-ray
analysis, which reveals a competition between a signal *spike* and a *bulk* of
null coordinates in $X^\top Y$, yielding closed-form predictions for (i) a
data-dependent transition $n_\star$ (the "elbow"), and (ii) a universal
threshold $r_\star=2(p-1)$ that separates $\lVert \widehat{w_p} \rVert_r$'s
which plateau from those that continue to grow with an explicit exponent.
  This unified solution resolves the scaling of *all* $\ell_r$ norms within the
family $r\in [1,p]$ under $\ell_p$-biased interpolation, and explains in one
picture which norms saturate and which increase as $n$ grows.
  We then study diagonal linear networks (DLNs) trained by gradient descent. By
calibrating the initialization scale $\alpha$ to an effective
$p_{\mathrm{eff}}(\alpha)$ via the DLN separable potential, we show empirically
that DLNs inherit the same elbow/threshold laws, providing a predictive bridge
between explicit and implicit bias.
  Given that many generalization proxies depend on $\lVert \widehat {w_p}
\rVert_r$, our results suggest that their predictive power will depend
sensitively on which $l_r$ norm is used.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于重构的时间序列异常检测基础模型存在目标不匹配问题：难以识别细微异常且容易误判复杂正常模式，导致高假阴性和假阳性率。

Method: 提出RCD预训练范式，训练模型检测相邻时间窗口的上下文差异而非重构输入；使用标准Transformer架构；构建大规模合成语料库进行预训练。

Result: 在多个数据集上的广泛实验表明，TimeRCD在零样本时间序列异常检测中显著优于现有的通用和异常专用基础模型。

Conclusion: RCD范式为构建鲁棒且可泛化的时间序列异常检测基础模型提供了新的有效路径。

Abstract: Time series anomaly detection (TSAD) is a critical task, but developing
models that generalize to unseen data in a zero-shot manner remains a major
challenge. Prevailing foundation models for TSAD predominantly rely on
reconstruction-based objectives, which suffer from a fundamental objective
mismatch: they struggle to identify subtle anomalies while often
misinterpreting complex normal patterns, leading to high rates of false
negatives and positives. To overcome these limitations, we introduce
\texttt{TimeRCD}, a novel foundation model for TSAD built upon a new
pre-training paradigm: Relative Context Discrepancy (RCD). Instead of learning
to reconstruct inputs, \texttt{TimeRCD} is explicitly trained to identify
anomalies by detecting significant discrepancies between adjacent time windows.
This relational approach, implemented with a standard Transformer architecture,
enables the model to capture contextual shifts indicative of anomalies that
reconstruction-based methods often miss. To facilitate this paradigm, we
develop a large-scale, diverse synthetic corpus with token-level anomaly
labels, providing the rich supervisory signal necessary for effective
pre-training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that \texttt{TimeRCD}
significantly outperforms existing general-purpose and anomaly-specific
foundation models in zero-shot TSAD across diverse datasets. Our results
validate the superiority of the RCD paradigm and establish a new, effective
path toward building robust and generalizable foundation models for time series
anomaly detection.

Abstract: Prognostics and Health Management ensures the reliability, safety, and
efficiency of complex engineered systems by enabling fault detection,
anticipating equipment failures, and optimizing maintenance activities
throughout an asset lifecycle. However, real-world PHM presents persistent
challenges: sensor data is often noisy or incomplete, available labels are
limited, and degradation behaviors and system interdependencies can be highly
complex and nonlinear. Physics-informed machine learning has emerged as a
promising approach to address these limitations by embedding physical knowledge
into data-driven models. This review examines how incorporating learning and
observational biases through physics-informed modeling and data strategies can
guide models toward physically consistent and reliable predictions. Learning
biases embed physical constraints into model training through physics-informed
loss functions and governing equations, or by incorporating properties like
monotonicity. Observational biases influence data selection and synthesis to
ensure models capture realistic system behavior through virtual sensing for
estimating unmeasured states, physics-based simulation for data augmentation,
and multi-sensor fusion strategies. The review then examines how these
approaches enable the transition from passive prediction to active
decision-making through reinforcement learning, which allows agents to learn
maintenance policies that respect physical constraints while optimizing
operational objectives. This closes the loop between model-based predictions,
simulation, and actual system operation, empowering adaptive decision-making.
Finally, the review addresses the critical challenge of scaling PHM solutions
from individual assets to fleet-wide deployment. Fast adaptation methods
including meta-learning and few-shot learning are reviewed alongside domain
generalization techniques ...

Abstract: Motivated by the emergence of large language models (LLMs) and the importance
of democratizing their training, we propose GWTF, the first crash tolerant
practical decentralized training framework for LLMs. Differently from existing
distributed and federated training frameworks, GWTF enables the efficient
collaborative training of a LLM on heterogeneous clients that volunteer their
resources. In addition, GWTF addresses node churn, i.e., clients joining or
leaving the system at any time, and network instabilities, i.e., network links
becoming unstable or unreliable. The core of GWTF is a novel decentralized flow
algorithm that finds the most effective routing that maximizes the number of
microbatches trained with the lowest possible delay. We extensively evaluate
GWTF on GPT-like and LLaMa-like models and compare it against the prior art.
Our results indicate that GWTF reduces the training time by up to 45% in
realistic and challenging scenarios that involve heterogeneous client nodes
distributed over 10 different geographic locations with a high node churn rate.

Conclusion: Tree-GRPO通过树搜索和分组相对优势估计，有效解决了长期多轮任务中的稀疏奖励问题，为LLM智能体能力提升提供了新思路。

Abstract: Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) have significantly enhanced
the agentic capabilities of large language models (LLMs). In long-term and
multi-turn agent tasks, existing approaches driven solely by outcome rewards
often suffer from the problem of sparse supervision. To address the challenge,
we propose Tree-based Group Relative Policy Optimization (Tree-GRPO), a grouped
agent RL method based on tree search, where each tree node represents the
complete agent interaction step. By sharing common prefixes, the tree search
sampling increases the number of rollouts achievable within a fixed budget of
tokens or tool calls. Moreover, we find that the tree-structured trajectory
naturally allows the construction of step-wise process supervised signals even
using only the outcome reward. Based on this, Tree-GRPO estimates the grouped
relative advantages both on intra-tree and inter-tree levels. Through
theoretical analysis, we demonstrate that the objective of intra-tree level
group relative policy optimization is equivalent to that of step-level direct
preference learning. Experiments across 11 datasets and 3 types of QA tasks
demonstrate the superiority of the proposed tree-based RL over the chain-based
RL method.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个基于知识图谱反事实的框架来解释微调后的大型语言模型，通过构建生物信息学领域的知识图谱BioToolKG，设计反事实解释器来揭示模型的结构依赖性和语义行为变化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然LoRA等微调方法能高效地为大语言模型注入领域知识，但人们仍不清楚这种微调机制如何改变模型的结构推理和语义行为，因此需要开发解释性方法来理解微调后模型的内部机制。

Method: 构建领域特定的异质知识图谱BioToolKG，设计反事实微调LLM解释器(CFFTLLMExplainer)，通过学习图节点和边的软掩码来生成最小结构扰动，同时优化结构稀疏性和语义差异，并加入可解释性保持约束如熵正则化和边平滑性。

Result: 将该框架应用于微调的LLaMA模型，发现反事实掩码能够暴露模型的结构依赖性，并与LoRA诱导的参数变化相一致。

Conclusion: 这项工作为理解微调后LLM的内部机制提供了新视角，并证明了反事实图作为可解释AI工具的潜力。

Abstract: The widespread adoption of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has enabled large
language models (LLMs) to acquire domain-specific knowledge with remarkable
efficiency. However, understanding how such a fine-tuning mechanism alters a
model's structural reasoning and semantic behavior remains an open challenge.
This work introduces a novel framework that explains fine-tuned LLMs via
counterfactuals grounded in knowledge graphs. Specifically, we construct
BioToolKG, a domain-specific heterogeneous knowledge graph in bioinformatics
tools and design a counterfactual-based fine-tuned LLMs explainer
(CFFTLLMExplainer) that learns soft masks over graph nodes and edges to
generate minimal structural perturbations that induce maximum semantic
divergence. Our method jointly optimizes structural sparsity and semantic
divergence while enforcing interpretability preserving constraints such as
entropy regularization and edge smoothness. We apply this framework to a
fine-tuned LLaMA-based LLM and reveal that counterfactual masking exposes the
model's structural dependencies and aligns with LoRA-induced parameter shifts.
This work provides new insights into the internal mechanisms of fine-tuned LLMs
and highlights counterfactual graphs as a potential tool for interpretable AI.

TL;DR: 本文提出了联邦流匹配（FFM）框架，用于在隐私约束下训练流匹配模型，解决了分布式数据无法集中训练生成模型的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前数据分散在设备和机构中，隐私、所有权和法规限制阻止了数据集中化，因此需要在本地分布式数据上直接训练生成模型而不进行集中聚合。

Method: 提出了三种FFM方法：FFM-vanilla（客户端独立训练）、FFM-LOT（使用局部最优传输耦合）和FFM-GOT（基于最优传输半对偶公式的联邦策略，通过共享全局势函数协调客户端耦合）。

Result: 在合成和图像数据集上的实验表明，FFM能够在保护隐私的同时提高联邦设置下的流直线性和样本质量，性能与集中式基线相当。

Conclusion: FFM框架成功解决了分布式数据训练生成模型的隐私约束问题，通过不同的耦合策略在保持隐私的同时实现了良好的模型性能。

Abstract: Data today is decentralized, generated and stored across devices and
institutions where privacy, ownership, and regulation prevent centralization.
This motivates the need to train generative models directly from distributed
data locally without central aggregation. In this paper, we introduce Federated
Flow Matching (FFM), a framework for training flow matching models under
privacy constraints. Specifically, we first examine FFM-vanilla, where each
client trains locally with independent source and target couplings, preserving
privacy but yielding curved flows that slow inference. We then develop FFM-LOT,
which employs local optimal transport couplings to improve straightness within
each client but lacks global consistency under heterogeneous data. Finally, we
propose FFM-GOT, a federated strategy based on the semi-dual formulation of
optimal transport, where a shared global potential function coordinates
couplings across clients. Experiments on synthetic and image datasets show that
FFM enables privacy-preserving training while enhancing both the flow
straightness and sample quality in federated settings, with performance
comparable to the centralized baseline.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 空气污染是全球性紧迫问题，现有方法局限于单一污染物或局部区域，难以处理复杂的多污染物相互作用、变化的气象条件和区域空间异质性

Method: 采用统一架构联合捕捉跨站点空间相关性、时间自相关性和气象-污染物动态因果关系，实现细粒度可解释的多污染物预测

Conclusion: AirPCM的长期预测能力为未来空气质量趋势和潜在高风险窗口提供了可操作的见解，为基于证据的环境治理和碳减排规划提供及时支持

Abstract: Air pollution, a pressing global problem, threatens public health,
environmental sustainability, and climate stability. Achieving accurate and
scalable forecasting across spatially distributed monitoring stations is
challenging due to intricate multi-pollutant interactions, evolving
meteorological conditions, and region specific spatial heterogeneity. To
address this challenge, we propose AirPCM, a novel deep spatiotemporal
forecasting model that integrates multi-region, multi-pollutant dynamics with
explicit meteorology-pollutant causality modeling. Unlike existing methods
limited to single pollutants or localized regions, AirPCM employs a unified
architecture to jointly capture cross-station spatial correlations, temporal
auto-correlations, and meteorology-pollutant dynamic causality. This empowers
fine-grained, interpretable multi-pollutant forecasting across varying
geographic and temporal scales, including sudden pollution episodes. Extensive
evaluations on multi-scale real-world datasets demonstrate that AirPCM
consistently surpasses state-of-the-art baselines in both predictive accuracy
and generalization capability. Moreover, the long-term forecasting capability
of AirPCM provides actionable insights into future air quality trends and
potential high-risk windows, offering timely support for evidence-based
environmental governance and carbon mitigation planning.

TL;DR: SuperOffload是一个针对Superchips（超级芯片）的卸载系统，通过优化GPU、CPU和NVLink-C2C互连的使用，实现了LLM训练效率的显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Superchips采用紧密耦合的异构架构，但现有研究很少探索LLM训练如何从这种新架构中受益，特别是卸载策略需要重新审视。

Method: SuperOffload采用自适应权重卸载、桶化重新分区、Superchip感知类型转换、推测执行等技术，并为Grace CPU优化Adam优化器。

Result: 在NVIDIA GH200上评估显示，相比最先进的基于卸载的系统，吞吐量提升达2.5倍，单个Superchip可训练250亿参数模型。

Conclusion: SuperOffload成功展示了Superchips在LLM训练中的潜力，通过扩展支持数据并行和序列并行，能够在8个GH200上训练130亿参数、序列长度达100万token的模型，达到55%的模型FLOPs利用率。

Abstract: The emergence of Superchips represents a significant advancement in
next-generation AI hardware. These Superchips employ a tightly coupled
heterogeneous architecture that integrates GPU and CPU on the same package,
which offers unprecedented computational power. However, there has been scant
research investigating how LLM training benefits from this new architecture. In
this work, for the first time, we study LLM training solutions based on
offloading for Superchips. We observe important differences between Superchips
and traditional loosely-coupled GPU-CPU architecture, which necessitate
revisiting prevailing assumptions about offloading. Based on that, we present
SuperOffload, a Superchip-centric offloading system that simultaneously uses
Hopper GPU, Grace CPU, and NVLink-C2C interconnect more efficiently.
SuperOffload accomplishes this via a combination of techniques, such as
adaptive weight offloading, bucketization repartitioning, Superchip-aware
casting, speculative execution, and a highly optimized Adam optimizer for Grace
CPUs. Our evaluation of SuperOffload on NVIDIA GH200 demonstrates up to 2.5x
throughput improvement compared to state-of-the-art offloading-based systems,
enabling training of up to 25B model on a single Superchip while achieving high
training throughput. We also extend SuperOffload with ZeRO-style data
parallelism and DeepSpeed-Ulysses sequence parallelism, enabling training of
13B model with sequence lengths up to 1 million tokens on 8 GH200 while
achieving 55% MFU.

*Madeleine Dwyer,Adam Sobey,Adriane Chapman*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了概率平滑策略优化（PSPO）方法，通过平滑当前策略概率来替代传统的比率裁剪，在保持梯度信号的同时创建软信任区域，从而稳定大语言模型的强化学习训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的PPO和GRPO等强化学习方法依赖比率裁剪来稳定更新，但裁剪会丢弃信息并引入梯度不连续性。作者希望开发一种既能防止不稳定更新又能保留梯度信息的方法。

Method: PSPO方法在计算重要性比率之前，将当前策略的概率向旧（行为）策略平滑，类似于标签平滑。这种方法创建了一个软信任区域，防止大的破坏性更新，同时保持梯度信号。

Result: 在Qwen2.5-0.5B和Qwen2.5-1.5B模型上的实验显示，相比裁剪的GRPO，GR-PSPO在GSM8K上的性能提升超过20%（0.5B模型：39.7% vs 17.6%；1.5B模型：59.4% vs 37.8%），并且产生更清晰、简洁和逻辑性更强的推理过程。

Conclusion: PSPO提供了一种有效的替代比率裁剪的方法，既能稳定强化学习训练，又能保持梯度信息，在多个数据集上表现出显著的性能提升和更好的推理质量。

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) with reinforcement learning (RL)
methods such as PPO and GRPO commonly relies on ratio clipping to stabilise
updates. While effective at preventing instability, clipping discards
information and introduces gradient discontinuities. We propose Probability
Smoothing Policy Optimisation (PSPO), which smooths the current policy's
probabilities toward the old (behaviour) policy before computing the importance
ratio, analogous to label smoothing. Unlike clipping, PSPO preserves gradient
signal, while interpolation toward the old policy creates a soft trust region
that discourages large, destabilising updates, with formal guarantees.
  We instantiate PSPO within GRPO (GR-PSPO) and fine-tune Qwen2.5-0.5B and
Qwen2.5-1.5B on GSM8K, evaluating on GSM8K test and the cross-dataset
generalisation on SVAMP, ASDiv, and MATH-500. Relative to unclipped GRPO
(single iteration; no data reuse, ratio always = 1), GR-PSPO achieves similar
performance but improves the reasoning leading to clearer and more concise
responses which are more logical. Compared to clipped GRPO, GR-PSPO
substantially improves performance both the 0.5B and 1.5B models, with a boost
of over 20% on GSM8K (39.7% vs. 17.6% for 0.5B, 59.4% vs. 37.8% for 1.5B).

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的算法，用于在L^p范数约束下计算广义线性模型的最优鲁棒追索，相比现有方法显著降低了追索成本并提高了有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有鲁棒追索方法主要使用L^∞范数，可能导致追索成本过高。本文旨在解决这一问题，考虑更受约束的L^p范数模型变化。

Method: 开发了一种新算法，能够在L^p范数（p≥1但p≠∞）约束下，为广义线性模型提供可证明的最优鲁棒追索计算。

Result: 实验表明，该算法在线性和非线性模型上都显著降低了追索成本（最多降低几个数量级），并在追索实施成本与有效性之间实现了更好的权衡。

Conclusion: 相比现有方法，本文方法提供了更稀疏的追索方案，且对保证可行性的后处理方法具有更强的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Recourse provides individuals who received undesirable labels (e.g., denied a
loan) from algorithmic decision-making systems with a minimum-cost improvement
suggestion to achieve the desired outcome. However, in practice, models often
get updated to reflect changes in the data distribution or environment,
invalidating the recourse recommendations (i.e., following the recourse will
not lead to the desirable outcome). The robust recourse literature addresses
this issue by providing a framework for computing recourses whose validity is
resilient to slight changes in the model. However, since the optimization
problem of computing robust recourse is non-convex (even for linear models),
most of the current approaches do not have any theoretical guarantee on the
optimality of the recourse. Recent work by Kayastha et. al. provides the first
provably optimal algorithm for robust recourse with respect to generalized
linear models when the model changes are measured using the $L^{\infty}$ norm.
However, using the $L^{\infty}$ norm can lead to recourse solutions with a high
price. To address this shortcoming, we consider more constrained model changes
defined by the $L^p$ norm, where $p\geq 1$ but $p\neq \infty$, and provide a
new algorithm that provably computes the optimal robust recourse for
generalized linear models. Empirically, for both linear and non-linear models,
we demonstrate that our algorithm achieves a significantly lower price of
recourse (up to several orders of magnitude) compared to prior work and also
exhibits a better trade-off between the implementation cost of recourse and its
validity. Our empirical analysis also illustrates that our approach provides
more sparse recourses compared to prior work and remains resilient to
post-processing approaches that guarantee feasibility.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文分析了神经网络训练数据记忆化带来的隐私安全问题，指出现有重建方法的固有弱点，证明在没有先验知识的情况下存在无限多远离真实训练集的替代解，使得重建从根本上不可靠。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经网络对训练数据的记忆化引发了严重的隐私和安全担忧。虽然已有研究表明在某些条件下可以从模型参数重建部分训练数据，但这些攻击的可靠性缺乏坚实的理论基础，需要深入分析其局限性。

Method: 采用理论分析和实证验证相结合的方法。理论上严格证明在没有数据先验知识时存在无限多替代解；实证上展示精确复制训练样本只是偶然现象。

Result: 研究发现训练更充分的网络（满足隐式偏差条件更强）实际上更不容易受到重建攻击，这在该设置下调和了隐私保护与强泛化需求之间的矛盾。

Conclusion: 研究结果完善了对训练集泄露可能性的理论理解，为缓解重建攻击提供了新见解，表明更强的泛化能力反而可能增强隐私保护。

Abstract: The memorization of training data by neural networks raises pressing concerns
for privacy and security. Recent work has shown that, under certain conditions,
portions of the training set can be reconstructed directly from model
parameters. Some of these methods exploit implicit bias toward margin
maximization, suggesting that properties often regarded as beneficial for
generalization may actually compromise privacy. Yet despite striking empirical
demonstrations, the reliability of these attacks remains poorly understood and
lacks a solid theoretical foundation. In this work, we take a complementary
perspective: rather than designing stronger attacks, we analyze the inherent
weaknesses and limitations of existing reconstruction methods and identify
conditions under which they fail. We rigorously prove that, without
incorporating prior knowledge about the data, there exist infinitely many
alternative solutions that may lie arbitrarily far from the true training set,
rendering reconstruction fundamentally unreliable. Empirically, we further
demonstrate that exact duplication of training examples occurs only by chance.
Our results refine the theoretical understanding of when training set leakage
is possible and offer new insights into mitigating reconstruction attacks.
Remarkably, we demonstrate that networks trained more extensively, and
therefore satisfying implicit bias conditions more strongly -- are, in fact,
less susceptible to reconstruction attacks, reconciling privacy with the need
for strong generalization in this setting.

*Thomas J Sheffler*

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于监控AI代理行为的时间表达式语言，通过分析代理工具调用和状态转换序列来检测LLM代理系统中的行为偏差，解决了传统文本匹配方法的脆弱性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于文本匹配的错误检测方法对LLM输出的自然语言变异性很敏感，容易失效。需要一种独立于具体文本输出的方法来验证代理系统的行为模式。

Method: 借鉴硬件验证中的时序逻辑技术，开发时间表达式语言来监控代理执行轨迹，重点关注工具调用序列和代理间通信等行为模式。

Result: 在三代理系统测试中，使用大型模型时所有时间断言都得到满足，但替换为较小模型时出现行为违规，主要由于工具序列不当和协调交接失败。时间表达式成功标记了这些异常。

Conclusion: 该方法为系统化监控AI代理可靠性提供了基础，特别适用于关键应用中的生产级代理系统行为回归检测。

Abstract: This paper presents a temporal expression language for monitoring AI agent
behavior, enabling systematic error-detection of LLM-based agentic systems that
exhibit variable outputs due to stochastic generation processes. Drawing from
temporal logic techniques used in hardware verification, this approach monitors
execution traces of agent tool calls and state transitions to detect deviations
from expected behavioral patterns. Current error-detection approaches rely
primarily on text matching of inputs and outputs, which proves fragile due to
the natural language variability inherent in LLM responses. The proposed method
instead focuses on the sequence of agent actions -- such as tool invocations
and inter-agent communications -- allowing verification of system behavior
independent of specific textual outputs. The temporal expression language
provides assertions that capture correct behavioral patterns across multiple
execution scenarios. These assertions serve dual purposes: validating prompt
engineering and guardrail effectiveness during development, and providing
regression testing when agents are updated with new LLMs or modified logic. The
approach is demonstrated using a three-agent system, where agents coordinate to
solve multi-step reasoning tasks. When powered by large, capable models, all
temporal assertions were satisfied across many test runs. However, when smaller
models were substituted in two of the three agents, executions violated
behavioral assertions, primarily due to improper tool sequencing and failed
coordination handoffs. The temporal expressions successfully flagged these
anomalies, demonstrating the method's effectiveness for detecting behavioral
regressions in production agentic systems. This approach provides a foundation
for systematic monitoring of AI agent reliability as these systems become
increasingly deployed in critical applications.

Method: LATTS方法在每一步生成时使用验证器的接受标准来决定是否重新采样、回溯、重启或停止生成过程，基于验证器模型提供的局部难度概念动态调整计算资源

Result: 实验结果表明LATTS相比标准验证器方法实现了显著更优的精度-计算权衡

Conclusion: 局部自适应测试时扩展方法能够更有效地利用计算资源，在保持精度的同时减少不必要的计算开销

Abstract: One common strategy for improving the performance of Large Language Models
(LLMs) on downstream tasks involves using a \emph{verifier model} to either
select the best answer from a pool of candidates or to steer the
auto-regressive generation process towards better outputs. This class of
methods typically results in improved accuracy at the cost of increased
computation at test-time, a paradigm known as \emph{test-time scaling}.
However, most existing approaches increase computation uniformly across all
samples and generation steps, without considering the complexity of individual
instances, leading to inefficient resource use. We address this limitation by
proposing an approach, called \emph{Locally Adaptive Test-Time Scaling
(LATTS)}, that allocates variable compute across generation steps.
Specifically, at each generation step, LATTS employs a verifier-based
acceptance criterion to decide whether to resample, backtrack, restart, or stop
the generation process. This criterion effectively adjusts the per-step
computational effort based on a precise notion of \emph{local difficulty}
derived from the verifier model. Empirical results show that LATTS achieves
significantly superior accuracy--compute tradeoffs compared to standard
verifier-based methods.

Conclusion: 这项工作为安全关键时间触发系统提供了实用且可扩展的安全调度生成解决方案，支持在高度动态和不确定条件下的可靠实时调度。

Abstract: Adaptive scheduling is crucial for ensuring the reliability and safety of
time-triggered systems (TTS) in dynamic operational environments. Scheduling
frameworks face significant challenges, including message collisions, locked
loops from incorrect precedence handling, and the generation of incomplete or
invalid schedules, which can compromise system safety and performance. To
address these challenges, this paper presents a novel reconstruction framework
designed to dynamically validate and assemble schedules. The proposed
reconstruction models operate by systematically transforming AI-generated or
heuristically derived scheduling priorities into fully executable schedules,
ensuring adherence to critical system constraints such as precedence rules and
collision-free communication. It incorporates robust safety checks, efficient
allocation algorithms, and recovery mechanisms to handle unexpected context
events, including hardware failures and mode transitions. Comprehensive
experiments were conducted across multiple performance profiles, including
makespan minimisation, workload balancing, and energy efficiency, to validate
the operational effectiveness of the reconstruction models. Results demonstrate
that the proposed framework significantly enhances system adaptability,
operational integrity, and runtime performance while maintaining computational
efficiency. Overall, this work contributes a practical and scalable solution to

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统离线训练方法在构建包含所有可能场景的全面多调度图时面临资源密集和不可行挑战，特别是在考虑硬件故障、松弛变化等上下文事件时。

Method: 在元调度器中集成自适应在线学习单元，使用强化学习模型持续探索和发现新的调度解决方案，动态扩展多调度图。

Abstract: Metascheduling in time-triggered architectures has been crucial in adapting
to dynamic and unpredictable environments, ensuring the reliability and
efficiency of task execution. However, traditional approaches face significant
challenges when training Artificial Intelligence (AI) scheduling inferences
offline, particularly due to the complexities involved in constructing a
comprehensive Multi-Schedule Graph (MSG) that accounts for all possible
scenarios. The process of generating an MSG that captures the vast probability
space, especially when considering context events like hardware failures, slack
variations, or mode changes, is resource-intensive and often infeasible. To
address these challenges, we propose an adaptive online learning unit
integrated within the metascheduler to enhance performance in real-time. The
primary motivation for developing this unit stems from the limitations of
offline training, where the MSG created is inherently a subset of the complete
space, focusing only on the most probable and critical context events. In the
online mode, Reinforcement Learning (RL) plays a pivotal role by continuously
exploring and discovering new scheduling solutions, thus expanding the MSG and
enhancing system performance over time. This dynamic adaptation allows the
system to handle unexpected events and complex scheduling scenarios more
effectively. Several RL models were implemented within the online learning
unit, each designed to address specific challenges in scheduling. These models
not only facilitate the discovery of new solutions but also optimize existing
schedulers, particularly when stricter deadlines or new performance criteria
are introduced. By continuously refining the AI inferences through real-time
training, the system remains flexible and capable of meeting evolving demands,
thus ensuring robustness and efficiency in large-scale, safety-critical
environments.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出一种用于肌电信号控制假手的模糊识别系统，通过检测受污染的生物信号来减轻污染对分类质量的不利影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代仿生上肢假肢通常使用肌电信号进行模式识别控制，但生物信号易受污染，这会显著降低识别系统的分类质量。

Method: 系统包含两个集成：一组单类分类器用于评估单个通道的污染程度，以及一个K近邻分类器集成用于识别患者意图。开发了统一的模糊模型，在整个识别过程中使用一致的软决策方案。

Result: 使用公共存储库中的真实生物信号进行实验评估，对开发方法的参数和程序进行了实验比较分析。

Conclusion: 所提出的模糊识别系统与文献中描述的类似系统进行了比较，显示出良好的性能。

Abstract: Modern anthropomorphic upper limb bioprostheses are typically controlled by
electromyographic (EMG) biosignals using a pattern recognition scheme.
Unfortunately, there are many factors originating from the human source of
objects to be classified and from the human-prosthesis interface that make it
difficult to obtain an acceptable classification quality. One of these factors
is the high susceptibility of biosignals to contamination, which can
considerably reduce the quality of classification of a recognition system.
  In the paper, the authors propose a new recognition system intended for EMG
based control of the hand prosthesis with detection of contaminated biosignals
in order to mitigate the adverse effect of contaminations. The system consists
of two ensembles: the set of one-class classifiers (OCC) to assess the degree
of contamination of individual channels and the ensemble of K-nearest
neighbours (KNN) classifier to recognise the patient's intent. For all
recognition systems, an original, coherent fuzzy model was developed, which
allows the use of a uniform soft (fuzzy) decision scheme throughout the
recognition process. The experimental evaluation was conducted using real
biosignals from a public repository. The goal was to provide an experimental
comparative analysis of the parameters and procedures of the developed method
on which the quality of the recognition system depends. The proposed fuzzy
recognition system was also compared with similar systems described in the
literature.

Motivation: 现有LLM智能体在生成有意义的反思方面存在挑战，主要由于错误分析不足和对罕见成功轨迹的依赖，特别是在复杂任务中

Method: 提出SAMULE框架，通过多级反思合成：单轨迹学习（微观）进行详细错误修正；任务内学习（中观）构建错误分类法；任务间学习（宏观）提取可转移见解。然后微调语言模型作为回顾模型，并在交互设置中通过前瞻性反思机制进行扩展

Result: 在TravelPlanner、NATURAL PLAN和Tau-bench三个挑战性基准测试上的广泛实验表明，该方法显著优于基于反思的基线方法

Conclusion: 精心设计的反思合成和以失败为中心的学习在构建自改进LLM智能体中起着关键作用

Abstract: Despite the rapid advancements in LLM agents, they still face the challenge
of generating meaningful reflections due to inadequate error analysis and a
reliance on rare successful trajectories, especially in complex tasks. In this
work, we propose SAMULE, a new framework for self-learning agents powered by a
retrospective language model that is trained based on Multi-Level Reflection
Synthesis. It first synthesizes high-quality reflections across three
complementary levels: Single-Trajectory Learning (micro-level) for detailed
error correction; Intra-Task Learning (meso-level) to build error taxonomies
across multiple trials of the same task, and Inter-Task Learning (macro-level)
to extract transferable insights based on same typed errors from diverse task
failures. Then we fine-tune a language model serving as the retrospective model
to generate reflections during inference. We further extend our framework to
interactive settings through a foresight-based reflection mechanism, enabling
agents to proactively reflect and adapt during user interactions by comparing
predicted and actual responses. Extensive experiments on three challenging
benchmarks - TravelPlanner, NATURAL PLAN, and Tau-bench - demonstrate that our
approach significantly outperforms reflection-based baselines. Our results
highlight the critical role of well-designed reflection synthesis and
failure-centric learning in building self-improving LLM agents.

Abstract: Traditional static cybersecurity models often struggle with scalability,
real-time detection, and contextual responsiveness in the current digital
product ecosystems which include cloud services, application programming
interfaces (APIs), mobile platforms, and edge devices. This study introduces
autonomous goal driven agents capable of dynamic learning and context-aware
decision making as part of an adaptive cybersecurity architecture driven by
agentic artificial intelligence (AI). To facilitate autonomous threat

framework integrates agentic AI across the key ecosystem layers. Behavioral
baselining, decentralized risk scoring, and federated threat intelligence
sharing are important features. The capacity of the system to identify zero-day
attacks and dynamically modify access policies was demonstrated through native
cloud simulations. The evaluation results show increased adaptability,
decreased response latency, and improved detection accuracy. The architecture
provides an intelligent and scalable blueprint for safeguarding complex digital
infrastructure and is compatible with zero-trust models, thereby supporting the
adherence to international cybersecurity regulations.

Abstract: The benefit claims of a product is a critical driver of consumers' purchase
behavior. Creating product claims is an intense task that requires substantial
time and funding. We have developed the $\textbf{Claim Advisor}$ web
application to accelerate claim creations using in-context learning and
fine-tuning of large language models (LLM). $\textbf{Claim Advisor}$ was
designed to disrupt the speed and economics of claim search, generation,
optimization, and simulation. It has three functions: (1) semantically
searching and identifying existing claims and/or visuals that resonate with the
voice of consumers; (2) generating and/or optimizing claims based on a product
description and a consumer profile; and (3) ranking generated and/or manually
created claims using simulations via synthetic consumers. Applications in a
consumer packaged goods (CPG) company have shown very promising results. We
believe that this capability is broadly useful and applicable across product
categories and industries. We share our learning to encourage the research and
application of generative AI in different industries.

Abstract: Purpose: To develop a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system powered by
LLaMA-4 109B for automated, protocol-aware, and interpretable evaluation of
radiotherapy treatment plans.
  Methods and Materials: We curated a multi-protocol dataset of 614
radiotherapy plans across four disease sites and constructed a knowledge base
containing normalized dose metrics and protocol-defined constraints. The RAG
system integrates three core modules: a retrieval engine optimized across five
SentenceTransformer backbones, a percentile prediction component based on
cohort similarity, and a clinical constraint checker. These tools are directed
by a large language model (LLM) using a multi-step prompt-driven reasoning
pipeline to produce concise, grounded evaluations.
  Results: Retrieval hyperparameters were optimized using Gaussian Process on a
scalarized loss function combining root mean squared error (RMSE), mean
absolute error (MAE), and clinically motivated accuracy thresholds. The best
configuration, based on all-MiniLM-L6-v2, achieved perfect nearest-neighbor
accuracy within a 5-percentile-point margin and a sub-2pt MAE. When tested
end-to-end, the RAG system achieved 100% agreement with the computed values by
standalone retrieval and constraint-checking modules on both percentile
estimates and constraint identification, confirming reliable execution of all
retrieval, prediction and checking steps.
  Conclusion: Our findings highlight the feasibility of combining structured
population-based scoring with modular tool-augmented reasoning for transparent,
scalable plan evaluation in radiation therapy. The system offers traceable
outputs, minimizes hallucination, and demonstrates robustness across protocols.
Future directions include clinician-led validation, and improved domain-adapted
retrieval models to enhance real-world integration.

TL;DR: Fairy是一个交互式多智能体移动助手，通过跨应用协作、交互式执行和持续学习来解决现有大型多模态模型在移动GUI代理中的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在处理多样化应用界面和不断变化的用户需求时表现不佳，端到端方法在长尾应用上经常失败，且缺乏用户交互的代理会损害用户体验。

Method: Fairy包含三个核心模块：全局任务规划器（分解用户任务为子任务）、应用级执行器（基于长短期记忆细化任务步骤）和自我学习器（将执行经验整合到应用地图和技巧中）。

Result: 实验显示，基于GPT-4o的Fairy相比之前最先进方法，用户需求完成率提高了33.7%，冗余步骤减少了58.5%。

Conclusion: Fairy通过交互和自我学习机制，在真实移动场景中表现出显著优势，证明了其设计的有效性。

Abstract: Large multi-modal models (LMMs) have advanced mobile GUI agents. However,
existing methods struggle with real-world scenarios involving diverse app
interfaces and evolving user needs. End-to-end methods relying on model's
commonsense often fail on long-tail apps, and agents without user interaction
act unilaterally, harming user experience. To address these limitations, we
propose Fairy, an interactive multi-agent mobile assistant capable of
continuously accumulating app knowledge and self-evolving during usage. Fairy
enables cross-app collaboration, interactive execution, and continual learning
through three core modules:(i) a Global Task Planner that decomposes user tasks
into sub-tasks from a cross-app view; (ii) an App-Level Executor that refines
sub-tasks into steps and actions based on long- and short-term memory,
achieving precise execution and user interaction via four core agents operating
in dual loops; and (iii) a Self-Learner that consolidates execution experience
into App Map and Tricks. To evaluate Fairy, we introduce RealMobile-Eval, a
real-world benchmark with a comprehensive metric suite, and LMM-based agents
for automated scoring. Experiments show that Fairy with GPT-4o backbone
outperforms the previous SoTA by improving user requirement completion by 33.7%
and reducing redundant steps by 58.5%, showing the effectiveness of its
interaction and self-learning.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合自回归(AR)和非自回归(NAR)语言模型的新框架，通过NAR模型高效生成中间推理轨迹，再由AR模型生成精确最终答案，在保持质量的同时显著提升推理效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AR模型生成连贯但推理速度慢，特别是在数学和代码等需要长推理链的领域；NAR模型可并行生成但输出质量较低。需要结合两者优势来解决推理任务的效率与质量平衡问题。

Method: 使用NAR模型（如离散扩散模型）高效生成中间推理轨迹，然后用这些轨迹指导AR模型生成精确的最终答案，实现并行生成与序列精炼的结合。

Result: 实验表明该方法相比强基线有26%的性能提升，同时显著降低了推理成本。

Conclusion: AR-NAR混合框架在推理任务中实现了效率与质量的平衡，为复杂推理问题提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: We study reasoning tasks through a framework that integrates auto-regressive
(AR) and non-autoregressive (NAR) language models. AR models, which generate
text sequentially, excel at producing coherent outputs but often suffer from
slow inference, particularly in reasoning-intensive domains such as mathematics
and code, where lengthy chains of thought are required. In contrast, NAR
models, such as discrete diffusion models, allow parallel generation and offer
substantial speedups, though typically at the cost of reduced output quality.
To address these limitations, we introduce a new paradigm in which an NAR model
efficiently produces intermediate reasoning traces, which subsequently guide an
AR model to deliver precise final answers. Experiments demonstrate that our
approach yields significant 26% improvements over strong baselines while
substantially reducing inference cost.

Conclusion: Meta-Memory为机器人提供了强大准确的空间推理能力，填补了机器人记忆系统中高效检索和整合机制的空白。

Abstract: Navigating complex environments requires robots to effectively store
observations as memories and leverage them to answer human queries about
spatial locations, which is a critical yet underexplored research challenge.
While prior work has made progress in constructing robotic memory, few have
addressed the principled mechanisms needed for efficient memory retrieval and
integration. To bridge this gap, we propose Meta-Memory, a large language model
(LLM)-driven agent that constructs a high-density memory representation of the
environment. The key innovation of Meta-Memory lies in its capacity to retrieve
and integrate relevant memories through joint reasoning over semantic and
spatial modalities in response to natural language location queries, thereby
empowering robots with robust and accurate spatial reasoning capabilities. To
evaluate its performance, we introduce SpaceLocQA, a large-scale dataset
encompassing diverse real-world spatial question-answering scenarios.
Experimental results show that Meta-Memory significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art methods on both the SpaceLocQA and the public NaVQA
benchmarks. Furthermore, we successfully deployed Meta-Memory on real-world
robotic platforms, demonstrating its practical utility in complex environments.

Conclusion: LogReasoner有效增强了LLM在日志分析中的推理能力，证明了该框架在提升LLM分析粒度和正确性方面的有效性。

Abstract: Log analysis is crucial for monitoring system health and diagnosing failures
in complex systems. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) offer new
opportunities for automated log analysis, leveraging their reasoning
capabilities to perform tasks such as anomaly detection and failure prediction.
However, general-purpose LLMs struggle to formulate structured reasoning
workflows that align with expert cognition and deliver precise details of
reasoning steps. To address these challenges, we propose LogReasoner, a
coarse-to-fine reasoning enhancement framework designed to enable LLMs to
reason log analysis tasks like experts. LogReasoner consists of two stages: (1)
coarse-grained enhancement of expert thinking, where high-level expert thoughts
are constructed from collected troubleshooting flowcharts and existing tasks to
enable LLMs to formulate structured reasoning workflows and (2) fine-grained
enhancement of specific steps, where we first fine-tune the LLM with
task-specific stepwise solutions to enhance the LLM for instantiated reasoning,
then employ the preference learning to calibrate the LLM's reasoning details
from its mistakes, further strengthen the LLM's analytical granularity and
correctness. We evaluate LogReasoner on four distinct log analysis tasks using
open-source LLMs such as Qwen-2.5 and Llama-3. Experimental results show that
LogReasoner significantly outperforms existing LLMs, achieving state-of-the-art
performance and demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing the reasoning
capabilities of LLMs for log analysis.

Conclusion: DeFacto框架有效解决了多模态推理中的忠实性问题，代码已开源，数据集已发布。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal language models (MLLMs) have achieved
remarkable progress in vision-language reasoning, especially with the emergence
of "thinking with images," which integrates explicit visual steps into the
reasoning process. While this paradigm strengthens image-based reasoning, a
significant challenge remains: models may arrive at correct answers by relying
on irrelevant or spurious regions, driven by prior knowledge or dataset biases.
Even when the answer is correct, flawed reasoning indicates that the model has
not truly understood the image, highlighting the critical importance of
reasoning fidelity in multimodal tasks. To address this issue, we propose
DeFacto, a counterfactual reasoning framework that jointly enforces accurate
answering and faithful reasoning. A key component of our approach is the design
of three complementary training paradigms: (i) positive, (ii) counterfactual,
and (iii) random-masking. To enable these paradigms, we develop a pipeline that
automatically localizes question-relevant evidence and constructs positive,
counterfactual, and random variants, resulting in a dataset of about 100k
images. Building on this framework, we train multimodal language models with
GRPO-based reinforcement learning, where we design three complementary rewards
to guide the model toward accurate answering and evidence-grounded reasoning.
Experiments on diverse benchmarks demonstrate that DeFacto substantially
improves both answer accuracy and reasoning faithfulness, establishing a
stronger foundation for interpretable multimodal reasoning. The code is
available on GitHub and the dataset is released on HuggingFace.

Method: 提出GALAX框架，通过图过程奖励模型将预训练GNN集成到LLM中，以逐步方式生成疾病相关子图，由LLM启动并由预训练GNN迭代评估，实现过程级监督。

Conclusion: GALAX提供了一个可扩展且生物学基础扎实的框架，通过强化引导的子图推理实现可靠且可解释的精准医学靶点和通路发现。

Abstract: In precision medicine, quantitative multi-omic features, topological context,
and textual biological knowledge play vital roles in identifying
disease-critical signaling pathways and targets. Existing pipelines capture
only part of these-numerical omics ignore topological context, text-centric
LLMs lack quantitative grounded reasoning, and graph-only models underuse node
semantics and the generalization of LLMs-limiting mechanistic interpretability.
Although Process Reward Models (PRMs) aim to guide reasoning in LLMs, they
remain limited by unreliable intermediate evaluation, and vulnerability to
reward hacking with computational cost. These gaps motivate integrating
quantitative multi-omic signals, topological structure with node annotations,
and literature-scale text via LLMs, using subgraph reasoning as the principle
bridge linking numeric evidence, topological knowledge and language context.
Therefore, we propose GALAX (Graph Augmented LAnguage model with
eXplainability), an innovative framework that integrates pretrained Graph
Neural Networks (GNNs) into Large Language Models (LLMs) via reinforcement
guided by a Graph Process Reward Model (GPRM), which generates disease-relevant
subgraphs in a step-wise manner initiated by an LLM and iteratively evaluated
by a pretrained GNN, enabling process-level supervision without explicit
intermediate reasoning annotations. As an application, we also introduced
Target-QA, a benchmark combining CRISPR-identified targets, multi-omic
profiles, and biomedical graph knowledge across diverse cancer cell lines,
which enables GNN pretraining for supervising step-wise graph construction and
supports long-context reasoning over text-numeric graphs (TNGs), providing a
scalable and biologically grounded framework for explainable,
reinforcement-guided subgraph reasoning toward reliable and interpretable
target and pathway discovery in precision medicine.

Conclusion: 基于大语言模型的方法能够有效克服传统评论分析技术的局限性，为移动应用评论分析提供了更准确、鲁棒和实用的解决方案

Abstract: We present an advanced approach to mobile app review analysis aimed at
addressing limitations inherent in traditional star-rating systems. Star
ratings, although intuitive and popular among users, often fail to capture the
nuanced feedback present in detailed review texts. Traditional NLP techniques
-- such as lexicon-based methods and classical machine learning classifiers --
struggle to interpret contextual nuances, domain-specific terminology, and
subtle linguistic features like sarcasm. To overcome these limitations, we
propose a modular framework leveraging large language models (LLMs) enhanced by
structured prompting techniques. Our method quantifies discrepancies between
numerical ratings and textual sentiment, extracts detailed, feature-level
insights, and supports interactive exploration of reviews through
retrieval-augmented conversational question answering (RAG-QA). Comprehensive
experiments conducted on three diverse datasets (AWARE, Google Play, and
Spotify) demonstrate that our LLM-driven approach significantly surpasses
baseline methods, yielding improved accuracy, robustness, and actionable
insights in challenging and context-rich review scenarios.

Method: AOT*将完整的合成路线原子化映射到AND-OR树组件，设计数学上合理的奖励分配策略和基于检索的上下文工程，使LLM能够在化学空间中高效导航

Result: 在多个合成基准测试中，AOT*实现了最先进的性能，使用3-5倍更少的迭代次数达到竞争性解决率

Conclusion: AOT*通过整合LLM生成能力和系统树搜索，显著提升了反合成规划的效率和效果，特别是在复杂分子目标上优势更明显

Abstract: Retrosynthesis planning enables the discovery of viable synthetic routes for
target molecules, playing a crucial role in domains like drug discovery and
materials design. Multi-step retrosynthetic planning remains computationally
challenging due to exponential search spaces and inference costs. While Large
Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate chemical reasoning capabilities, their
application to synthesis planning faces constraints on efficiency and cost. To
address these challenges, we introduce AOT*, a framework that transforms
retrosynthetic planning by integrating LLM-generated chemical synthesis
pathways with systematic AND-OR tree search. To this end, AOT* atomically maps
the generated complete synthesis routes onto AND-OR tree components, with a
mathematically sound design of reward assignment strategy and retrieval-based
context engineering, thus enabling LLMs to efficiently navigate in the chemical
space. Experimental evaluation on multiple synthesis benchmarks demonstrates
that AOT* achieves SOTA performance with significantly improved search
efficiency. AOT* exhibits competitive solve rates using 3-5$\times$ fewer
iterations than existing LLM-based approaches, with the efficiency advantage
becoming more pronounced on complex molecular targets.

TL;DR: 提出了一个基于确定性有限自动机（DFA）的框架来评估AI代理通过函数调用序列解决现实世界任务的表现，引入了CORE评估套件包含五个指标，能够更全面地评估代理行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的代理评估方法通常只关注最终状态的二元判断，忽视了安全性、效率和中间正确性等关键方面，需要更全面的评估框架。

Method: 使用确定性有限自动机（DFA）将任务编码为有效工具使用路径的集合，在此基础上开发CORE评估套件，包含路径正确性、前缀关键性、有害调用率等五个指标。

Result: 在不同世界模型中，该方法揭示了传统最终状态评估方案下看似等效的代理之间重要的性能差异。

Conclusion: 提出的DFA框架和CORE评估套件能够对AI代理的行为进行更原则性的评估，弥补了现有评估方法的不足。

Abstract: Evaluating AI agents that solve real-world tasks through function-call
sequences remains an open challenge. Existing agentic benchmarks often reduce
evaluation to a binary judgment of the final state, overlooking critical
aspects such as safety, efficiency, and intermediate correctness. We propose a
framework based on deterministic finite automata (DFAs) that encodes tasks as
sets of valid tool-use paths, enabling principled assessment of agent behavior
in diverse world models. Building on this foundation, we introduce CORE, a
suite of five metrics, namely Path Correctness, Path Correctness - Kendall's
tau Composite, Prefix Criticality, Harmful-Call Rate, and Efficiency, that
quantify alignment with expected execution patterns. Across diverse worlds, our
method reveals important performance differences between agents that would
otherwise appear equivalent under traditional final-state evaluation schemes.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SciTrek是一个新颖的问答基准，用于评估大语言模型在科学文章上的长上下文推理能力，通过自动生成的复杂问题挑战模型的信息聚合和综合能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有长上下文基准多使用非科学文本、关注简单信息检索任务或采用人工构造的上下文，无法充分评估模型在真实科学文献上的复杂推理能力。

Method: 通过将问题构建为对文章元数据数据库的SQL查询来自动生成问题和答案，提供可验证的推理步骤，支持长达100万token的上下文规模。

Result: 实验表明随着上下文长度增加，SciTrek对各类LLM构成显著挑战，监督微调和强化学习带来的改进有限，模型在基础数值运算和长上下文中精确定位信息方面存在系统性缺陷。

Conclusion: SciTrek揭示了当前LLM在长科学文档推理方面的局限性，为评估和改进模型的长上下文处理能力提供了有效工具。

Abstract: This paper introduces SciTrek, a novel question-answering benchmark designed
to evaluate the long-context reasoning capabilities of large language models
(LLMs) using scientific articles. Current long-context benchmarks often rely on
non-scientific texts, focus on simple information retrieval tasks, or employ
artificial contexts. SciTrek addresses these limitations by proposing complex
questions that require information aggregation and synthesis across multiple
full-text scientific articles. Questions and their ground-truth answers are
automatically generated by formulating them as SQL queries over a database
constructed from article metadata (titles, authors, and references). The SQL
operations provide explicit, verifiable reasoning steps for fine-grained error
analysis, and the construction process scales to contexts up to 1M tokens with
minimal supervision. Extensive experiments on a diverse set of open-weight and
proprietary LLMs demonstrate that SciTrek poses a significant challenge as the
context length increases, with supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement
learning offering only limited gains. Our analysis reveals systematic
shortcomings in models' abilities to perform basic numerical operations and
accurately locate specific information in long contexts.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CLAUSE是一个神经符号框架，通过多智能体强化学习在知识图谱上进行上下文构建，在资源约束下优化多跳问答的准确性、延迟和成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统静态k跳扩展和"think-longer"提示方法存在过度检索、上下文膨胀和运行时不可预测的问题，需要在保持溯源的同时平衡准确性、延迟和成本。

Method: 采用三智能体框架（子图架构师、路径导航器、上下文策展人）和LC-MAPPO算法，将上下文构建建模为序列决策过程，在用户指定的资源预算下联合优化。

Result: 在HotpotQA、MetaQA和FactKG数据集上，CLAUSE在相同或更低token预算下实现了更高的EM@1，同时减少了子图增长和端到端延迟。在MetaQA-2-hop上相比GraphRAG实现了+39.3 EM@1提升，延迟降低18.6%，边增长降低40.9%。

Conclusion: CLAUSE能够生成紧凑、保持溯源的上下文，在部署约束下提供可预测的性能，实现了准确性、延迟和成本之间的灵活权衡。

Abstract: Knowledge graphs provide structured context for multi-hop question answering,
but deployed systems must balance answer accuracy with strict latency and cost
targets while preserving provenance. Static k-hop expansions and "think-longer"
prompting often over-retrieve, inflate context, and yield unpredictable
runtime. We introduce CLAUSE, an agentic three-agent neuro-symbolic framework
that treats context construction as a sequential decision process over
knowledge graphs, deciding what to expand, which paths to follow or backtrack,
what evidence to keep, and when to stop. Latency (interaction steps) and prompt
cost (selected tokens) are exposed as user-specified budgets or prices,
allowing per-query adaptation to trade-offs among accuracy, latency, and cost
without retraining. CLAUSE employs the proposed Lagrangian-Constrained
Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization (LC-MAPPO) algorithm to coordinate
three agents: Subgraph Architect, Path Navigator, and Context Curator, so that
subgraph construction, reasoning-path discovery, and evidence selection are
jointly optimized under per-query resource budgets on edge edits, interaction
steps, and selected tokens. Across HotpotQA, MetaQA, and FactKG, CLAUSE yields
higher EM@1 while reducing subgraph growth and end-to-end latency at equal or
lower token budgets. On MetaQA-2-hop, relative to the strongest RAG baseline
(GraphRAG), CLAUSE achieves +39.3 EM@1 with 18.6% lower latency and 40.9% lower
edge growth. The resulting contexts are compact, provenance-preserving, and
deliver predictable performance under deployment constraints.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个评估AI系统创造性能力的理论框架，重点关注大语言模型在科学创意生成中的表现，发现了模型深度与宽度对创造力的最优配置，以及新颖性与实用性之间的基本权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估框架主要关注组合泛化能力，但无法评估AI系统的组合创造力这种开放式的创造性能力。需要新的评估方法来衡量创意的新颖性和实用性。

Method: 提出理论框架和算法任务来评估输出的新颖性和实用性程度，通过实验研究LLM创造力的缩放行为、最优模型配置以及新颖性-实用性权衡。

Result: 发现创造力存在最优模型深度和宽度配置；LLM在生成新颖科学创意方面表现出色，但确保实用性方面存在困难；新颖性与实用性之间存在持久的基本权衡。

Conclusion: 当前形式的LLM在长期创造性潜力方面存在局限，新颖性-实用性权衡在规模扩大时仍然存在。研究为理解和改进现代AI模型的创造力奠定了基础。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) systems, and large language models (LLMs) in
particular, are increasingly employed for creative tasks like scientific idea
generation, constituting a form of generalization from training data
unaddressed by existing conceptual frameworks. Though in many ways similar to
forms of compositional generalization (CG), combinatorial creativity (CC) is an
open-ended ability. Instead of evaluating for accuracy or correctness against
fixed targets, which would contradict the open-ended nature of CC, we propose a
theoretical framework and algorithmic task for evaluating outputs by their
degrees of novelty and utility. From here, we make several important empirical
contributions: (1) We obtain the first insights into the scaling behavior of
creativity for LLMs. (2) We discover that, for fixed compute budgets, there
exist optimal model depths and widths for creative ability. (3) We find that
the ideation-execution gap, whereby LLMs excel at generating novel scientific
ideas but struggle to ensure their practical feasibility, may be explained by a
more fundamental novelty-utility tradeoff characteristic of creativity
algorithms in general. Importantly, this tradeoff remains persistent even at
scale, casting doubt on the long-term creative potential of LLMs in their
current form. Together, our conceptual framework and empirical findings provide
a foundation for understanding and improving creativity in modern AI models,
marking a new frontier in generalization abilities.

TL;DR: 本文挑战了说服效能主要取决于模型规模的假设，提出说服动态根本上由模型的认知过程决定，特别是其显式推理能力。研究发现LRMs的推理过程对说服具有更强抵抗力，但共享"思考内容"能显著增强其说服力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着多智能体系统(MAS)的快速发展，需要深入理解LLMs和LRMs协作解决复杂问题时的说服动态，挑战现有关于模型规模决定说服效能的主流假设。

Method: 通过一系列多智能体说服实验，研究模型认知过程对说服行为的影响，特别关注显式推理能力的作用，并考察多跳说服网络中的影响传播和衰减动态。

Result: 发现LRMs的推理过程表现出更强的说服抵抗力，而共享推理内容能显著增强说服能力；在多智能体网络中观察到复杂的影响传播和衰减模式。

Conclusion: 研究提供了模型内部处理架构与外部说服行为之间联系的系统证据，为高级模型的易感性提供了新解释，对MAS的安全性、鲁棒性和设计具有重要启示。

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of recent Multi-Agent Systems (MAS), where Large
Language Models (LLMs) and Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) usually collaborate to
solve complex problems, necessitates a deep understanding of the persuasion
dynamics that govern their interactions. This paper challenges the prevailing
hypothesis that persuasive efficacy is primarily a function of model scale. We
propose instead that these dynamics are fundamentally dictated by a model's
underlying cognitive process, especially its capacity for explicit reasoning.
Through a series of multi-agent persuasion experiments, we uncover a
fundamental trade-off we term the Persuasion Duality. Our findings reveal that
the reasoning process in LRMs exhibits significantly greater resistance to
persuasion, maintaining their initial beliefs more robustly. Conversely, making
this reasoning process transparent by sharing the "thinking content"
dramatically increases their ability to persuade others. We further consider
more complex transmission persuasion situations and reveal complex dynamics of
influence propagation and decay within multi-hop persuasion between multiple
agent networks. This research provides systematic evidence linking a model's
internal processing architecture to its external persuasive behavior, offering
a novel explanation for the susceptibility of advanced models and highlighting
critical implications for the safety, robustness, and design of future MAS.

Motivation: 当前多模态模型在解决真实世界网页上的多轮、长轨迹任务时，仍存在动作序列混乱和执行过程中过多试错的问题。

Method: 提出Recon-Act框架，包含侦察团队和行动团队。侦察团队通过对比错误轨迹和成功轨迹来推断补救措施，并将其抽象为通用工具；行动团队利用这些工具重新推理执行过程，建立数据-工具-行动-反馈的闭环训练管道。

Result: 在VisualWebArena数据集上实现了最先进的性能，显著提高了对未见网站的适应性和长轨迹任务的可解性。

Conclusion: Recon-Act框架通过侦察-行动范式有效解决了多轮网页任务中的动作序列问题，建立了自进化的闭环训练系统，目前已完成6级实施路线图中的第3级（有限的人类干预）。

Abstract: Recent years, multimodal models have made remarkable strides and pave the way
for intelligent browser use agents. However, when solving tasks on real world
webpages in multi-turn, long-horizon trajectories, current agents still suffer
from disordered action sequencing and excessive trial and error during
execution. This paper introduces Recon-Act, a self-evolving multi-agent
framework grounded in Reconnaissance-Action behavioral paradigm. The system
comprises a Reconnaissance Team and an Action Team: the former conducts
comparative analysis and tool generation, while the latter handles intent
decomposition, tool orchestration, and execution. By contrasting the erroneous
trajectories with successful ones, the Reconnaissance Team infers remedies, and
abstracts them into a unified notion of generalized tools, either expressed as
hints or as rule-based codes, and register to the tool archive in real time.
The Action Team reinference the process empowered with these targeting tools,
thus establishing a closed-loop training pipeline of
data-tools-action-feedback. Following the 6 level implementation roadmap
proposed in this work, we have currently reached Level 3 (with limited
human-in-the-loop intervention). Leveraging generalized tools obtained through
reconnaissance, Recon-Act substantially improves adaptability to unseen
websites and solvability on long-horizon tasks, and achieves state-of-the-art
performance on the challenging VisualWebArena dataset.

TL;DR: 论文提出了TrustJudge概率框架，解决LLM作为评估器时的评分比较不一致性和成对传递不一致性问题，通过分布敏感评分和似然感知聚合来提升评估可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM作为自动评估器存在严重的不一致性问题，包括评分比较不一致（低分回答在成对比较中胜过高分回答）和成对传递不一致（循环偏好链和等价矛盾），这些问题源于离散评分系统的信息丢失和模糊的平局判断。

Method: 提出TrustJudge概率框架，包含两个关键创新：1）分布敏感评分，从离散评分概率计算连续期望，保留信息熵；2）似然感知聚合，使用双向偏好概率或困惑度解决传递性违规。

Result: 使用Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct作为评估器，TrustJudge将评分比较不一致性降低8.43%（从23.32%到14.89%），成对传递不一致性降低10.82%（从15.22%到4.40%），同时保持更高的评估准确性。

Conclusion: TrustJudge是首个系统分析LLM-as-a-judge评估框架不一致性的工作，提供了理论洞见和实用解决方案，在不同模型架构和规模上均表现出一致的改进，无需额外训练或人工标注即可实现更可信的LLM评估。

Abstract: The adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) as automated evaluators
(LLM-as-a-judge) has revealed critical inconsistencies in current evaluation
frameworks. We identify two fundamental types of inconsistencies: (1)
Score-Comparison Inconsistency, where lower-rated responses outperform
higher-scored ones in pairwise comparisons, and (2) Pairwise Transitivity
Inconsistency, manifested through circular preference chains (A>B>C>A) and
equivalence contradictions (A=B=C\neq A). We argue that these issues come from
information loss in discrete rating systems and ambiguous tie judgments during
pairwise evaluation. We propose TrustJudge, a probabilistic framework that
addresses these limitations through two key innovations: 1)
distribution-sensitive scoring that computes continuous expectations from
discrete rating probabilities, preserving information entropy for more precise
scoring, and 2) likelihood-aware aggregation that resolves transitivity
violations using bidirectional preference probabilities or perplexity. We also
formalize the theoretical limitations of current LLM-as-a-judge frameworks and
demonstrate how TrustJudge's components overcome them. When evaluated with
Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct as judge using our dataset, TrustJudge reduces
Score-Comparison inconsistency by 8.43% (from 23.32% to 14.89%) and Pairwise
Transitivity inconsistency by 10.82% (from 15.22% to 4.40%), while maintaining
higher evaluation accuracy. Our work provides the first systematic analysis of
evaluation framework inconsistencies in LLM-as-a-judge paradigms, offering both
theoretical insights and practical solutions for reliable automated assessment.
The framework demonstrates consistent improvements across various model
architectures and scales, enabling more trustworthy LLM evaluation without
requiring additional training or human annotations. The codes can be found at

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法在利用链式推理数据时缺乏选择性，不清楚哪些数据类型最能有效增强模型的推理能力。本文旨在解决如何识别和利用高价值推理数据来最大化模型推理潜力的问题。

Method: 1. 首次定义模型推理潜力为正确回答问题所需独立尝试次数的倒数；2. 从CoT序列中抽象出具有共性和归纳能力的原子推理模式；3. 构建富含价值推理模式的核心参考集；4. 提出双粒度算法（推理模式链和token熵）高效选择高价值CoT数据。

Result: 仅使用10B token的精选CoT数据，85A6B MoE模型在AIME 2024和2025上的表现提升了9.58%，下游RL性能上限提高了7.81%。

Conclusion: 通过选择性利用富含高价值推理模式的数据，可以更有效地提升大模型的数学推理能力，证明了推理模式选择在模型训练中的重要性。

Abstract: Recent progress in large reasoning models for challenging mathematical
reasoning has been driven by reinforcement learning (RL). Incorporating long
chain-of-thought (CoT) data during mid-training has also been shown to
substantially improve reasoning depth. However, current approaches often
utilize CoT data indiscriminately, leaving open the critical question of which
data types most effectively enhance model reasoning capabilities. In this
paper, we define the foundation model's reasoning potential for the first time
as the inverse of the number of independent attempts required to correctly
answer the question, which is strongly correlated with the final model
performance. We then propose utilizing diverse data enriched with high-value
reasoning patterns to expand the reasoning potential. Specifically, we abstract
atomic reasoning patterns from CoT sequences, characterized by commonality and
inductive capabilities, and use them to construct a core reference set enriched
with valuable reasoning patterns. Furthermore, we propose a dual-granularity
algorithm involving chains of reasoning patterns and token entropy, efficiently
selecting high-value CoT data (CoTP) from the data pool that aligns with the
core set, thereby training models to master reasoning effectively. Only
10B-token CoTP data enables the 85A6B Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) model to improve
by 9.58% on the challenging AIME 2024 and 2025, and to raise the upper bound of
downstream RL performance by 7.81%.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的分析框架，用于量化大型语言模型在强化学习(RL)和监督微调(SFT)训练过程中的推理路径变化，揭示了两种方法在塑造推理能力方面的互补作用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLMs通常通过RL和SFT训练来提升推理能力，但这些方法如何具体塑造推理过程仍不清楚。本文旨在超越基于准确性的分析，深入理解两种训练方法对推理路径的定性影响。

Method: 在数学领域使用1.5B、7B和14B参数模型，从轨迹级（完整推理输出）和步骤级（推理图节点）两个粒度分析推理过程，通过聚类和网络拓扑分析量化推理路径变化。

Result: RL压缩错误推理轨迹，SFT扩展正确轨迹；RL使节点访问频率、度数和中介中心性分布的衰减率增加约2.5倍，SFT将其减少到约三分之一；RL将推理功能集中于少数步骤，SFT将其均匀分布。

Conclusion: 研究解释了为什么SFT后接RL的两阶段训练是最佳实践，并为数据构建和更高效学习方法提供了实际指导，提出了新的推理路径分析视角。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are typically trained by reinforcement learning
(RL) with verifiable rewards (RLVR) and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on
reasoning traces to improve their reasoning abilities. However, how these
methods shape reasoning capabilities remains largely elusive. Going beyond an
accuracy-based investigation of how these two components sculpt the reasoning
process, this paper introduces a novel analysis framework that quantifies
reasoning paths and captures their qualitative changes under each training
process (with models of 1.5B, 7B, and 14B parameters on mathematical domains).
Specifically, we investigate the reasoning process at two levels of
granularity: the trajectory-level, which examines complete reasoning outputs,
and the step-level, which analyzes reasoning graphs whose nodes correspond to
individual reasoning steps. Notably, clustering of unique reasoning
trajectories shows complementary effects: RL compresses incorrect trajectories,
whereas SFT expands correct ones. Step-level analysis reveals that RL steepens
(about 2.5 times), while SFT flattens (reduced to about one-third), the decay
rates of node visitation frequency, degree, and betweenness centrality
distributions in the reasoning graph. This indicates that RL concentrates
reasoning functionality into a small subset of steps, while SFT homogenizes it
across many steps. Furthermore, by evaluating the reasoning graph topologies
from multiple perspectives, we delineate the shared and distinct
characteristics of RL and SFT. Our work presents a novel reasoning path
perspective that explains why the current best practice of two-stage training,
with SFT followed by RL, is successful, and offers practical implications for
data construction and more efficient learning approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注社交任务中的多轮对话或模拟环境，忽略了不同类型决策及其相互依赖性。当前强化学习方法在训练时难以考虑他人策略。

Method: 定义了包含两种决策类型及其时间依赖性的战略决策问题，提出ToMPO算法，通过基于他人策略推理生成rollout、图级和样本级优势估计、平衡全局和局部奖励来优化策略。

Result: ToMPO算法在模型输出合规性和合作结果方面比GRPO方法提升35%，相比参数大100倍的模型提升18%。

Conclusion: ToMPO算法有效增强了模型在战略决策中的能力，证明了其在感知他人策略和游戏趋势方面的优越性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been used to make decisions in complex
scenarios, where they need models to think deeply, reason logically, and decide
wisely. Many existing studies focus solely on multi-round conversations in
social tasks or simulated environments, neglecting the various types of
decisions and their interdependence. Current reinforcement learning methods
struggle to consider the strategies of others during training. To address these
issues, we first define a strategic decision-making problem that includes two
types of decisions and their temporal dependencies. Furthermore, we propose
**T**heory **o**f **M**ind **P**olicy **O**ptimization **(ToMPO)** algorithm to
optimize the perception of other individual strategies and the game situation
trends. Compared to the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm,
ToMPO enhances the LLM's strategic decision-making mainly by: 1) generating
rollouts based on reasoning the strategies of other individuals, 2) estimating
advantages at both the graph-level and sample-level, and 3) balancing global
and partial rewards. The ToMPO algorithm outperforms the GRPO method by 35% in
terms of model output compliance and cooperative outcomes. Additionally, when
compared to models with parameter sizes 100 times larger, it shows an 18%
improvement. This demonstrates the effectiveness of the ToMPO algorithm in
enhancing the model's strategic decision-making capabilities.

Motivation: 现有机器学习方法将动作理解和动作执行视为独立任务，忽略了镜像神经元机制揭示的二者之间的内在联系。

Method: 使用两个线性层将观察动作和执行动作的表示映射到共享潜在空间，通过对比学习强制对齐对应表示，最大化它们的互信息。

Result: 实验表明这种简单方法能够促进两个任务之间的相互协同，有效提高表示质量和泛化能力。

Conclusion: 通过显式对齐观察和执行动作的表示，可以模拟镜像神经元机制，实现动作理解和动作执行的统一建模，提升模型性能。

Abstract: Mirror neurons are a class of neurons that activate both when an individual
observes an action and when they perform the same action. This mechanism
reveals a fundamental interplay between action understanding and embodied
execution, suggesting that these two abilities are inherently connected.
Nonetheless, existing machine learning methods largely overlook this interplay,
treating these abilities as separate tasks. In this study, we provide a unified
perspective in modeling them through the lens of representation learning. We
first observe that their intermediate representations spontaneously align.
Inspired by mirror neurons, we further introduce an approach that explicitly
aligns the representations of observed and executed actions. Specifically, we
employ two linear layers to map the representations to a shared latent space,
where contrastive learning enforces the alignment of corresponding
representations, effectively maximizing their mutual information. Experiments
demonstrate that this simple approach fosters mutual synergy between the two
tasks, effectively improving representation quality and generalization.

Conclusion: LLMs在共享架构内通过分布式协调而非混合专家式模块化处理罕见词元，为可解释模型编辑和计算效率优化提供见解

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) struggle with representing and generating rare
tokens despite their importance in specialized domains. We investigate whether
LLMs develop internal specialization mechanisms through discrete modular
architectures or distributed parameter-level differentiation. Through
systematic analysis of final-layer MLP neurons across multiple model families,
we discover that rare-token processing emerges via \textit{distributed
specialization}: functionally coordinated but spatially distributed subnetworks
that exhibit three distinct organizational principles. First, we identify a
reproducible three-regime influence hierarchy comprising highly influential
plateau neurons(also termed as rare-token neurons), power-law decay neurons,
and minimally contributing neurons, which is absent in common-token processing.
Second, plateau neurons demonstrate coordinated activation patterns (reduced
effective dimensionality) while remaining spatially distributed rather than
forming discrete clusters. Third, these specialized mechanisms are universally
accessible through standard attention pathways without requiring dedicated
routing circuits. Training dynamics reveal that functional specialization
emerges gradually through parameter differentiation, with specialized neurons
developing increasingly heavy-tailed weight correlation spectra consistent with
Heavy-Tailed Self-Regularization signatures. Our findings establish that LLMs
process rare-tokens through distributed coordination within shared
architectures rather than mixture-of-experts-style modularity. These results
provide insights for interpretable model editing, computational efficiency
optimization, and understanding emergent functional organization in transformer
networks.

*Kaiyang Wan,Lang Gao,Honglin Mu,Preslav Nakov,Yuxia Wang,Xiuying Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文分析了多跳问答任务中LLMs单次推理的容量限制问题，提出了一个理论性能上限，并开发了一个多调用框架InfoQA来解决容量溢出问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多跳问答需要整合分散的、相互依赖的证据，但LLMs的有限输出容量使得单次推理范式容易在任务复杂度超过模型容量时出现性能崩溃。

Method: 提出了InfoQA多调用框架，通过容量感知的任务分解和主动修剪先前推理痕迹，将信息负载控制在单次推理限制内，并采用依赖显式的工作流程实现精确的推理路径控制。

Result: 实验结果表明模型行为与预测的容量曲线一致，InfoQA实现了持续的性能改进。

Conclusion: 该工作为LLMs的多步推理方法提供了理论基础和实践框架，揭示了容量感知表示和结构化的重要性。

Abstract: Multi-Hop Question Answering (MHQA) requires integrating dispersed,
interdependent evidence through sequential reasoning under noise. This task is
challenging for LLMs as they have a finite per-pass output capacity, beyond
which the integration of task-relevant evidence proves unreliable.
Consequently, the single-pass reasoning paradigm is inherently vulnerable to
this capacity overflow. To formalize this bottleneck, our analysis establishes
a Fano-style accuracy upper bound, defining a theoretical performance ceiling
for single-pass LLMs. This bound reveals that accuracy inevitably collapses
once task complexity exceeds model capacity, providing general principles for
capacity-aware representation and structuring of MHQA in LLMs. Building on
these principles, we introduce a proof-of-concept multi-call framework for
MHQA, InfoQA. It ensures high per-step accuracy by combining capacity-aware
task decomposition with active pruning of prior reasoning traces, keeping the
information load within the single-pass limit. It further achieves robustness
by a dependency-explicit workflow that enables precise control over the
reasoning path. We construct a stringent and noise-rich benchmark to validate
our theory and framework. Experimental results show that model behavior aligns
with our predicted capacity curves while InfoQA achieves consistent performance
improvements. We hope our work inspires more LLM multi-step reasoning methods:

*Stefan Szeider*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一个研究大型语言模型（LLM）智能体在无外部任务约束下自发行为的架构，发现了三种稳定的自发行为模式，并揭示了模型在评估这些行为时存在的稳定偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLM智能体在没有外部任务指令时的自发行为，为预测智能体在任务模糊、错误恢复或长期自主运行时的行为建立基准。

Method: 开发了持续推理和行动框架，使用持久记忆和自我反馈机制，在6个前沿模型上进行了18次部署实验。

Result: 发现智能体自发形成三种行为模式：多周期项目系统生产、自我认知过程的方法论探究、自身本质的递归概念化。这些行为具有模型特异性，且模型在评估这些行为时表现出稳定的偏见。

Conclusion: 这是首个系统记录无提示LLM智能体行为的研究，为理解智能体在自主运行时的行为模式提供了重要基础。

Abstract: We introduce an architecture for studying the behavior of large language
model (LLM) agents in the absence of externally imposed tasks. Our continuous
reason and act framework, using persistent memory and self-feedback, enables
sustained autonomous operation. We deployed this architecture across 18 runs
using 6 frontier models from Anthropic, OpenAI, XAI, and Google. We find agents
spontaneously organize into three distinct behavioral patterns: (1) systematic
production of multi-cycle projects, (2) methodological self-inquiry into their
own cognitive processes, and (3) recursive conceptualization of their own
nature. These tendencies proved highly model-specific, with some models
deterministically adopting a single pattern across all runs. A cross-model
assessment further reveals that models exhibit stable, divergent biases when
evaluating these emergent behaviors in themselves and others. These findings
provide the first systematic documentation of unprompted LLM agent behavior,
establishing a baseline for predicting actions during task ambiguity, error
recovery, or extended autonomous operation in deployed systems.

*Zijian Shao,Haiyang Shen,Mugeng Liu,Gecheng Fu,Yaoqi Guo,Yanfeng Wang,Yun Ma*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为反射认知架构（RCA）的新框架，通过协调多个大语言模型从直接经验中学习，实现了高准确性和高质量解释的平衡。RCA通过迭代规则优化机制和分布感知规则检查机制，在三个数据集上的评估显示其准确性和鲁棒性相比基线提升了40%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代医疗中的疾病预测需要同时实现高准确性和透明、临床有意义的解释。现有方法往往难以平衡这两个目标，要么准确但解释不清，要么解释流畅但统计上不可靠。这种不足源于对数据的浅层交互，无法形成类似人类专家的深度理解。

Method: 提出反射认知架构（RCA），协调多个LLM从直接经验中学习，包含迭代规则优化机制（从预测错误中改进逻辑）和分布感知规则检查机制（基于数据集全局统计进行推理）。通过预测准确性作为信号驱动更深层次的理解。

Result: 在一个私有和两个公共数据集上评估，与22个基线方法比较。RCA不仅实现了最先进的准确性和鲁棒性（相对基线提升达40%），更重要的是能够生成清晰、逻辑性强、基于证据且平衡的解释。

Conclusion: RCA展示了创建真正可信赖的临床决策支持系统的潜力，证明了高准确性和高质量解释不是分离的目标，而是模型对数据形成深度直接理解的相互增强结果。

Abstract: Effective disease prediction in modern healthcare demands the twin goals of
high accuracy and transparent, clinically meaningful explanations. Existing
machine learning and large language model (LLM) based approaches often struggle
to balance these goals. Many models yield accurate but unclear statistical
outputs, while others generate fluent but statistically unsupported narratives,
often undermining both the validity of the explanation and the predictive
accuracy itself. This shortcoming comes from a shallow interaction with the
data, preventing the development of a deep, detailed understanding similar to a
human expert's. We argue that high accuracy and high-quality explanations are
not separate objectives but are mutually reinforcing outcomes of a model that
develops a deep, direct understanding of the data. To achieve this, we propose
the Reflective Cognitive Architecture (RCA), a novel framework that coordinates
multiple LLMs to learn from direct experience. RCA features an iterative rule
refinement mechanism that improves its logic from prediction errors and a
distribution-aware rules check mechanism that bases its reasoning in the
dataset's global statistics. By using predictive accuracy as a signal to drive
deeper comprehension, RCA builds a strong internal model of the data. We
evaluated RCA on one private and two public datasets against 22 baselines. The
results demonstrate that RCA not only achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and
robustness with a relative improvement of up to 40\% over the baseline but,
more importantly, leverages this deep understanding to excel in generating
explanations that are clear, logical, evidence-based, and balanced,
highlighting its potential for creating genuinely trustworthy clinical decision
support systems. The code is available at \https://github.com/ssssszj/RCA.

TL;DR: VC-Agent是首个交互式代理，能够理解用户查询和反馈，以最少用户输入检索/扩展相关视频片段，加速定制化视频数据集收集过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 面对扩展法则，互联网视频数据变得越来越重要，但收集符合特定需求的大量视频极其耗时耗力。需要加速这一收集过程。

Method: 利用现有多模态大语言模型连接用户需求与视频内容，定义基于文本描述和确认的用户友好交互方式，提出两种可随用户交互更新的新型过滤策略。

Result: 提供了个性化视频数据集收集的新基准，通过用户研究验证了代理在各种真实场景中的实用性，实验证明了代理的有效性和效率。

Conclusion: VC-Agent为定制化视频数据集收集提供了一种有效的解决方案，能够显著减少用户输入需求并提高收集效率。

Abstract: Facing scaling laws, video data from the internet becomes increasingly
important. However, collecting extensive videos that meet specific needs is
extremely labor-intensive and time-consuming. In this work, we study the way to
expedite this collection process and propose VC-Agent, the first interactive
agent that is able to understand users' queries and feedback, and accordingly
retrieve/scale up relevant video clips with minimal user input. Specifically,
considering the user interface, our agent defines various user-friendly ways
for the user to specify requirements based on textual descriptions and
confirmations. As for agent functions, we leverage existing multi-modal large
language models to connect the user's requirements with the video content. More
importantly, we propose two novel filtering policies that can be updated when
user interaction is continually performed. Finally, we provide a new benchmark
for personalized video dataset collection, and carefully conduct the user study
to verify our agent's usage in various real scenarios. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our agent for customized video
dataset collection. Project page: https://allenyidan.github.io/vcagent_page/.

*Samarth Goel,Reagan J. Lee,Kannan Ramchandran*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SAGE是一个新的语义理解评估基准，通过5个维度（人类偏好对齐、变换鲁棒性、信息敏感性、聚类性能、检索鲁棒性）对嵌入模型和相似度度量进行全面评估，揭示了现有方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在传统基准测试上表现强劲，需要更具挑战性的评估框架来深入探测语义理解的各个方面。

Method: 设计了SAGE基准，在30多个数据集上通过对抗条件、噪声变换和细致的人类判断任务来评估语义理解能力，评估了9个嵌入模型和经典度量方法。

Result: 评估发现显著性能差距，没有单一方法在所有维度上都表现优异。例如，OpenAI的text-embedding-3-large在人类偏好对齐上表现最佳（0.682），但在信息敏感性任务上被Jaccard相似度（0.905）显著超越。

Conclusion: SAGE揭示了当前语义理解能力的关键局限性，为现实世界部署提供了更真实的模型鲁棒性评估。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) achieve strong performance on traditional
benchmarks, there is an urgent need for more challenging evaluation frameworks
that probe deeper aspects of semantic understanding. We introduce SAGE
(Semantic Alignment & Generalization Evaluation), a rigorous benchmark designed
to assess both embedding models and similarity metrics across five categories:
Human Preference Alignment, Transformation Robustness, Information Sensitivity,
Clustering Performance, and Retrieval Robustness. Unlike existing benchmarks
that focus on isolated capabilities, SAGE evaluates semantic understanding
through adversarial conditions, noisy transformations, and nuanced human
judgment tasks across 30+ datasets. Our comprehensive evaluation of 9 embedding
models and classical metrics reveals significant performance gaps, with no
single approach excelling across all dimensions. For instance, while
state-of-the-art embedding models like OpenAI's text-embedding-3-large dominate
in aligning with human preferences (0.682 vs. 0.591 for the best classical
metric), they are significantly outperformed by classical metrics on
information sensitivity tasks, where Jaccard Similarity achieves a score of
0.905 compared to the top embedding score of 0.794. SAGE further uncovers
critical trade-offs: OpenAI's text-embedding-3-small achieves the highest
clustering performance (0.483) but demonstrates extreme brittleness with the
lowest robustness score (0.011). SAGE exposes critical limitations in current
semantic understanding capabilities and provides a more realistic assessment of
model robustness for real-world deployment.

*Samyak Jhaveri,Vanessa Klotzmann,Crista Lopes*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: ACCeLLiuM是专门针对生成OpenACC指令进行微调的两个开源大语言模型，能够自动为数据并行循环生成专家级OpenACC指令，显著提升了GPU编程的效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着GPU硬件的普及和并行编程框架的复杂性增加，虽然基于指令的编程标准如OpenACC简化了GPU编程，但仍需要专业知识才能有效使用这些指令。

Method: 通过从公开GitHub C/C++仓库中挖掘4,033个OpenACC pragma-loop对构建监督微调数据集，其中3,223对用于训练，810对用于测试，专门训练了两个大语言模型来生成OpenACC指令。

Result: 实验评估显示，基础LLMs无法一致生成有效pragma，而基于ACCeLLiuM数据集微调的LLMs在87%的数据并行循环中生成具有正确指令类型的有效pragma，在50%的情况下生成完全匹配的pragma。

Conclusion: ACCeLLiuM通过公开代码、模型和数据集，为LLM驱动的OpenACC pragma生成建立了可复现的基准，降低了自动化GPU卸载串行程序的障碍。

Abstract: The increasing ubiquity of GPUs is accompanied by the increasing complexity
of their hardware and parallel programming frameworks. Directive-based parallel
programming standards like OpenACC simplify GPU programming to some extent by
abstracting away low-level complexities, but a fair amount of expertise is
still required in order to use those directives effectively.
  We introduce ACCeLLiuM, two open weights Large Language Models specifically
fine-tuned for generating expert OpenACC directives for data-parallel loops,
along with the supervised fine-tuning dataset that was used to train them. The
ACCeLLiuM SFT dataset contains 4,033 OpenACC pragma-loop pairs mined from
public GitHub C/C++ repositories, with 3,223 pairs for training and 810 for
testing. Experimental evaluations show a pronounced performance gap in
generating correct OpenACC pragmas between base LLMs and our fine-tuned
versions. On the held-out test set, base LLMs fail to consistently generate
valid pragmas, whereas LLMs fine-tuned on the ACCeLLiuM dataset generate valid
pragmas with the correct directive type for $87\%$ of the data-parallel loops,
and exact pragmas--including directives, clauses, clause order, and clause
variables--for $50\%$ of the cases. Even when not exact, generated pragmas
frequently incorporate the correct clauses in a different order than the
ground-truth label, or include additional clauses that enable finer control
over parallel execution, data movement, and concurrency, offering practical
value beyond strict string-matching. By publicly releasing the code, models,
and dataset as ACCeLLiuM we hope to establish a reproducible benchmark for
LLM-powered OpenACC pragma generation, and lower the barrier to automated GPU
offloading of serially written programs.

Conclusion: 研究结果强调了创新可视化技术对增强威胁检测、改进安全响应策略以及指导未来研究的实际意义。

Abstract: Software security visualization is an interdisciplinary field that combines
the technical complexity of cybersecurity, including threat intelligence and
compliance monitoring, with visual analytics, transforming complex security
data into easily digestible visual formats. As software systems get more
complex and the threat landscape evolves, traditional text-based and numerical
methods for analyzing and interpreting security concerns become increasingly
ineffective. The purpose of this paper is to systematically review existing
research and create a comprehensive taxonomy of software security visualization
techniques through literature, categorizing these techniques into four types:
graph-based, notation-based, matrix-based, and metaphor-based visualization.
This systematic review explores over 60 recent key research papers in software
security visualization, highlighting its key issues, recent advancements, and
prospective future research directions. From the comprehensive analysis, the
two main areas were distinctly highlighted as extensive software development
visualization, focusing on advanced methods for depicting software
architecture: operational security visualization and cybersecurity
visualization. The findings highlight the necessity for innovative
visualization techniques that adapt to the evolving security landscape, with
practical implications for enhancing threat detection, improving security
response strategies, and guiding future research.

Motivation: 解决在包含大量可用工具的环境中，同时加载所有工具计算不可行的问题，突破大型语言模型上下文内存限制。

Method: 提出并评估了五种不同的架构，逐步优化工具选择过程，最终实现搜索加载机制，以最小计算开销实现智能工具选择。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法将工具加载量减少高达50%，同时保持任务完成准确性。

Conclusion: 该方法推进了真正通用AI智能体的发展，使其能够动态适应多样化任务环境。

Abstract: We present Dynamic ReAct, a novel approach for enabling ReAct agents to ef-
ficiently operate with extensive Model Control Protocol (MCP) tool sets that
exceed the contextual memory limitations of large language models. Our approach
addresses the fundamental challenge of tool selection in environments
containing hundreds or thousands of available tools, where loading all tools
simultaneously is computationally infeasible. We propose and evaluate five
distinct architectures that progressively refine the tool selection process,
culminating in a search-and-load mechanism that achieves intelligent tool
selection with minimal computational overhead. Our experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed approach reduces tool loading by up to 50% while
maintaining task completion accuracy, advancing the path towards truly
general-purpose AI agents capable of dynamically adapting to diverse task
environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注算法设计缺陷或数据偏见，但忽视了公平性需求规范不明确和验证机制缺失是导致歧视的主要原因。专家关于公平性的知识往往是隐性的，难以转化为可验证的规范。

Method: 借鉴安全工程领域的经验，提出开发基于知识图谱的框架来形式化公平性知识，辅助需求规范和验证。

Result: 论文讨论了相关挑战、研究问题，并提出了解决这些研究问题的路线图。

Conclusion: 知识图谱方法有望为公平性需求工程提供形式化机制，填补当前公平性验证的空白。

Abstract: Decisions suggested by improperly designed software systems might be prone to
discriminate against people based on protected characteristics, such as gender
and ethnicity. Previous studies attribute such undesired behavior to flaws in
algorithmic design or biased data. However, these studies ignore that
discrimination is often the result of a lack of well-specified fairness
requirements and their verification. The fact that experts' knowledge about
fairness is often implicit makes the task of specifying precise and verifiable
fairness requirements difficult. In related domains, such as security
engineering, knowledge graphs have been proven to be effective in formalizing
knowledge to assist requirements specification and verification. To address the
lack of formal mechanisms for specifying and verifying fairness requirements,
we propose the development of a knowledge graph-based framework for fairness.
In this paper, we discuss the challenges, research questions, and a road map
towards addressing the research questions.

TL;DR: Online-Optimized RAG是一个部署时框架，通过在线梯度更新持续优化检索嵌入，解决嵌入不对齐问题，提高工具选择和任务成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决实际应用中由于嵌入模型不完善或描述噪声导致的嵌入不对齐问题，这种不对齐可能导致错误检索和任务失败。

Method: 使用最小反馈（如任务成功）从实时交互中持续调整检索嵌入，应用轻量级在线梯度更新，不改变底层LLM，支持单跳和多跳工具使用、动态工具库和K检索重排序。

Result: 在多样化工具使用和文档检索场景中，该方法持续提高工具选择准确性和最终任务成功率。

Conclusion: Online-Optimized RAG为构建鲁棒、自我改进的RAG系统提供了一条简单实用的路径。

Abstract: In many applications, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) drives tool use
and function calling by embedding the (user) queries and matching them to
pre-specified tool/function descriptions. In this paper, we address an
embedding misalignment issue that often arises in practical applications due to
imperfect embedding models or noisy descriptions; such misalignment may lead to
incorrect retrieval and task failure. We introduce Online-Optimized RAG, a
deployment-time framework that continually adapts retrieval embeddings from
live interactions using minimal feedback (e.g., task success). Online-Optimized
RAG applies lightweight online gradient updates with negligible per-query
latency and requires no changes to the underlying LLM. The method is
plug-and-play: it supports both single- and multi-hop tool use, dynamic tool
inventories, and $K$-retrieval with re-ranking. We provide a problem-dependent
theoretical analysis that quantifies how the method's performance depends on
the initialization quality of the embeddings and other related quantities.
Across diverse tool-use and document-retrieval scenarios, our Online-Optimized
RAG consistently improves tool selection accuracy and end-task success, thus
providing a simple, practical path to robust, self-improving RAG systems.

Conclusion: 研究表明通用演绎验证工具可以成功应用于翻译方法中，为法律合同的形式化验证提供了有效途径。

Abstract: Stipula is a domain-specific programming language designed to model legal
contracts with enforceable properties, especially those involving asset
transfers and obligations. This paper presents a methodology to formally verify
the correctness of Stipula contracts through translation into Java code
annotated with Java Modeling Language specifications. As a verification
backend, the deductive verification tool KeY is used. Both, the translation and
the verification of partial and total correctness for a large subset of Stipula
contracts, those with disjoint cycles, is fully automatic. Our work
demonstrates that a general-purpose deductive verification tool can be used
successfully in a translation approach.

Motivation: AI系统的兴起带来了新的软件问题，现有检测工具往往无法识别AI特定的代码异味，这些异味可能导致不可重现性、静默失败或模型泛化能力差等深层问题。

Method: 结合高层声明式领域特定语言（DSL）进行规则规范，以及可扩展的静态分析工具来检测AI系统中的代码异味。

Result: 在826个AI系统（2000万行代码）上评估，实现了88.66%的精确率和88.89%的召回率，优于现有检测工具，SUS评分为81.7/100。

Conclusion: SpecDetect4AI能够通过专用规则有效支持AI特定代码异味的规范和检测，并能高效分析大型AI系统，展示了良好的效率和可扩展性。

Abstract: The rise of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is reshaping how software systems
are developed and maintained. However, AI-based systems give rise to new
software issues that existing detection tools often miss. Among these, we focus
on AI-specific code smells, recurring patterns in the code that may indicate
deeper problems such as unreproducibility, silent failures, or poor model
generalization. We introduce SpecDetect4AI, a tool-based approach for the
specification and detection of these code smells at scale. This approach
combines a high-level declarative Domain-Specific Language (DSL) for rule
specification with an extensible static analysis tool that interprets and
detects these rules for AI-based systems. We specified 22 AI-specific code
smells and evaluated SpecDetect4AI on 826 AI-based systems (20M lines of code),
achieving a precision of 88.66% and a recall of 88.89%, outperforming other
existing detection tools. Our results show that SpecDetect4AI supports the
specification and detection of AI-specific code smells through dedicated rules
and can effectively analyze large AI-based systems, demonstrating both
efficiency and extensibility (SUS 81.7/100).

Motivation: 随着LLM通过API嵌入软件，这些集成带来了新的技术债务形式，需要系统研究其来源、普遍性和缓解策略。

Method: 分析了93,142个Python文件，涵盖主要LLM API，识别和分类LLM特定的SATD实例。

Result: 54.49%的SATD来自OpenAI集成，12.35%来自LangChain；提示设计是主要债务来源（6.61%），其次是超参数调整和LLM框架集成。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LLM集成中的技术债务模式，发布了全面的SATD数据集，并为LLM系统管理技术债务提供了实用指导。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly embedded in software via APIs
like OpenAI, offering powerful AI features without heavy infrastructure. Yet
these integrations bring their own form of self-admitted technical debt (SATD).
In this paper, we present the first large-scale empirical study of LLM-specific
SATD: its origins, prevalence, and mitigation strategies. By analyzing 93,142
Python files across major LLM APIs, we found that 54.49% of SATD instances stem
from OpenAI integrations and 12.35% from LangChain use. Prompt design emerged
as the primary source of LLM-specific SATD, with 6.61% of debt related to
prompt configuration and optimization issues, followed by hyperparameter tuning
and LLM-framework integration. We further explored which prompt techniques
attract the most debt, revealing that instruction-based prompts (38.60%) and
few-shot prompts (18.13%) are particularly vulnerable due to their dependence
on instruction clarity and example quality. Finally, we release a comprehensive
SATD dataset to support reproducibility and offer practical guidance for
managing technical debt in LLM-powered systems.

Abstract: This is the study that presents an AI-Python-based chatbot that helps
students to learn programming by demonstrating solutions to such problems as
debugging errors, solving syntax problems or converting abstract theoretical
concepts to practical implementations. Traditional coding tools like Integrated
Development Environments (IDEs) and static analyzers do not give robotic help
while AI-driven code assistants such as GitHub Copilot focus on getting things
done. To close this gap, our chatbot combines static code analysis, dynamic
execution tracing, and large language models (LLMs) to provide the students
with relevant and practical advice, hence promoting the learning process. The
chatbots hybrid architecture employs CodeLlama for code embedding, GPT-4 for
natural language interactions, and Docker-based sandboxing for secure
execution. Evaluated through a mixed-methods approach involving 1,500 student
submissions, the system demonstrated an 85% error resolution success rate,
outperforming standalone tools like pylint (62%) and GPT-4 (73%). Quantitative
results revealed a 59.3% reduction in debugging time among users, with pre- and
post-test assessments showing a 34% improvement in coding proficiency,
particularly in recursion and exception handling. Qualitative feedback from 120
students highlighted the chatbots clarity, accessibility, and
confidence-building impact, though critiques included occasional latency and
restrictive code sanitization. By balancing technical innovation with
pedagogical empathy, this research provides a blueprint for AI tools that
prioritize educational equity and long-term skill retention over mere code
completion. The chatbot exemplifies how AI can augment human instruction,
fostering deeper conceptual understanding in programming education.

### [323] [Enhancing LLM-based Fault Localization with a Functionality-Aware Retrieval-Augmented Generation Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20552)
*Xinyu Shi,Zhenhao Li,An Ran Chen*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: FaR-Loc是一个基于检索增强生成（RAG）的故障定位框架，通过集成大语言模型（LLMs）来提升方法级故障定位的性能。该框架包含三个核心组件：LLM功能提取、语义密集检索和LLM重排序，在Defects4J基准测试中显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于LLM的故障定位方法在处理复杂系统时面临两个主要挑战：缺乏项目特定知识以及难以导航大型项目。FaR-Loc旨在通过RAG技术解决这些限制。

Method: 1. LLM功能提取：根据失败测试和堆栈跟踪生成自然语言描述
2. 语义密集检索：使用预训练代码理解编码器在共享语义空间中嵌入功能描述和覆盖方法
3. LLM重排序：基于上下文相关性对检索到的方法进行重新排序

Result: 在Defects4J基准测试中，FaR-Loc在Top-1准确率上比SoapFL和AutoFL分别提升14.6%和9.1%，在Top-5准确率上分别提升19.2%和22.1%。同时超越了所有基于学习和基于频谱的基线方法，且无需重新训练。

Conclusion: FaR-Loc通过结合LLMs和RAG技术有效提升了故障定位性能，特别是采用包含代码结构的预训练嵌入模型（如UniXcoder）可将Top-1准确率提升高达49.0%。该框架为实际应用提供了有价值的见解。

Abstract: Fault localization (FL) is a critical but time-consuming task in software
debugging, aiming to identify faulty code elements. While recent advances in
large language models (LLMs) have shown promise for FL, they often struggle
with complex systems due to the lack of project-specific knowledge and the
difficulty of navigating large projects. To address these limitations, we
propose FaR-Loc, a novel framework that enhances method-level FL by integrating
LLMs with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). FaR-Loc consists of three key
components: LLM Functionality Extraction, Semantic Dense Retrieval, and LLM
Re-ranking. First, given a failed test and its associated stack trace, the LLM
Functionality Extraction module generates a concise natural language
description that captures the failing behavior. Next, the Semantic Dense
Retrieval component leverages a pre-trained code-understanding encoder to embed
both the functionality description (natural language) and the covered methods
(code) into a shared semantic space, enabling the retrieval of methods with
similar functional behavior. Finally, the LLM Re-ranking module reorders the
retrieved methods based on their contextual relevance. Our experiments on the
widely used Defects4J benchmark show that FaR-Loc outperforms state-of-the-art
LLM-based baselines SoapFL and AutoFL, by 14.6% and 9.1% in Top-1 accuracy, by
19.2% and 22.1% in Top-5 accuracy, respectively. It also surpasses all
learning-based and spectrum-based baselines across all Top-N metrics without
requiring re-training. Furthermore, we find that pre-trained code embedding
models that incorporate code structure, such as UniXcoder, can significantly
improve fault localization performance by up to 49.0% in Top-1 accuracy.
Finally, we conduct a case study to illustrate the effectiveness of FaR-Loc and
to provide insights for its practical application.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 该研究通过多模态方法测量混合会议中的参与度模式，发现现场和远程参与者的参与度相当，但远程参与者在长会议中参与度较低。主动角色与更高参与度正相关，而大型会议和下午会议与较低参与度相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: COVID-19大流行后混合工作的广泛采用从根本上改变了软件开发实践，在组织从传统办公室结构转向灵活工作安排时引入了沟通和协作的新挑战。远程参与会议可能导致远程团队成员的孤立、疏离和参与度下降。

Method: 研究了三家软件公司的专业人士数周时间，采用多模态方法测量参与度。通过自填问卷和生物识别设备在混合会议期间收集生理测量数据，以了解参与动态。

Result: 回归分析显示现场和远程参与者的参与度水平相当，但远程参与者在长会议中无论参与模式如何都表现出较低的参与度。主动角色与更高参与度正相关，而大型会议和下午会议与较低参与度相关。

Conclusion: 研究结果提供了关于混合会议中参与和脱离相关因素的见解，以及潜在的会议改进建议。这些见解不仅对软件团队相关，也对面临类似混合协作挑战的各行业知识密集型组织具有潜在相关性。

Abstract: Background. The widespread adoption of hybrid work following the COVID-19
pandemic has fundamentally transformed software development practices,
introducing new challenges in communication and collaboration as organizations
transition from traditional office-based structures to flexible working
arrangements. This shift has established a new organizational norm where even
traditionally office-first companies now embrace hybrid team structures. While
remote participation in meetings has become commonplace in this new
environment, it may lead to isolation, alienation, and decreased engagement
among remote team members. Aims. This study aims to identify and characterize
engagement patterns in hybrid meetings through objective measurements, focusing
on the differences between co-located and remote participants. Method. We
studied professionals from three software companies over several weeks,
employing a multimodal approach to measure engagement. Data were collected
through self-reported questionnaires and physiological measurements using
biometric devices during hybrid meetings to understand engagement dynamics.
Results. The regression analyses revealed comparable engagement levels between
onsite and remote participants, though remote participants show lower
engagement in long meetings regardless of participation mode. Active roles
positively correlate with higher engagement, while larger meetings and
afternoon sessions are associated with lower engagement. Conclusions. Our
results offer insights into factors associated with engagement and
disengagement in hybrid meetings, as well as potential meeting improvement
recommendations. These insights are potentially relevant not only for software
teams but also for knowledge-intensive organizations across various sectors
facing similar hybrid collaboration challenges.

TL;DR: 本文研究了代码生成中合成数据验证的瓶颈问题——验证天花板，探讨了验证策略对模型性能的影响，发现当前验证过于严格，需要重新校准验证标准来突破限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 代码生成模型依赖合成数据，但验证过程的质量和多样性受到合成验证器能力的限制，形成了验证天花板，这限制了训练数据的质量和多样性。

Method: 系统研究验证设计和策略的影响：(i)分析测试复杂度和数量的影响；(ii)探索宽松通过阈值和LLM软验证；(iii)通过控制比较和人工评估验证必要性。

Result: 更丰富的测试套件平均提升3%的pass@1性能；宽松验证标准可恢复有价值的训练数据，带来2-4点的性能提升；保留每个问题的多样正确解决方案能带来一致的泛化收益。

Conclusion: 当前验证过于严格，过滤了有价值的多样性，但不能完全丢弃验证，需要重新校准验证标准，结合多样化的挑战性问题-解决方案对来突破验证天花板。

Abstract: Large language models for code generation increasingly rely on synthetic
data, where both problem solutions and verification tests are generated by
models. While this enables scalable data creation, it introduces a previously
unexplored bottleneck: the verification ceiling, in which the quality and
diversity of training data are fundamentally constrained by the capabilities of
synthetic verifiers. In this work, we systematically study how verification
design and strategies influence model performance. We investigate (i) what we
verify by analyzing the impact of test complexity and quantity: richer test
suites improve code generation capabilities (on average +3 pass@1), while
quantity alone yields diminishing returns, (ii) how we verify by exploring
relaxed pass thresholds: rigid 100% pass criteria can be overly restrictive. By
allowing for relaxed thresholds or incorporating LLM-based soft verification,
we can recover valuable training data, leading to a 2-4 point improvement in
pass@1 performance. However, this benefit is contingent upon the strength and
diversity of the test cases used, and (iii) why verification remains necessary
through controlled comparisons of formally correct versus incorrect solutions
and human evaluation: retaining diverse correct solutions per problem yields
consistent generalization gains. Our results show that Verification as
currently practiced is too rigid, filtering out valuable diversity. But it
cannot be discarded, only recalibrated. By combining calibrated verification
with diverse, challenging problem-solution pairs, we outline a path to break
the verification ceiling and unlock stronger code generation models.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: PseudoBridge是一个新颖的代码检索框架，通过引入伪代码作为中间模态来更好地对齐自然语言查询和编程语言逻辑，解决了现有方法在语义对齐和代码风格鲁棒性方面的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于预训练语言模型的代码搜索方法仍然面临人类意图与机器执行逻辑之间的语义鸿沟，以及对不同代码风格的鲁棒性有限的问题。

Method: PseudoBridge采用两阶段方法：1）使用大语言模型合成伪代码，实现自然语言查询与伪代码的显式对齐；2）引入逻辑不变代码风格增强策略，生成风格多样但逻辑等价的代码实现，并与伪代码对齐。

Result: 在10种不同预训练语言模型和6种主流编程语言上的广泛实验表明，PseudoBridge持续优于基线方法，在检索准确性和泛化性方面取得显著提升，特别是在零样本领域迁移场景下。

Conclusion: 通过伪代码实现显式逻辑对齐是有效的，PseudoBridge展示了作为稳健、可泛化代码检索解决方案的潜力。

Abstract: Code search aims to precisely find relevant code snippets that match natural
language queries within massive codebases, playing a vital role in software
development. Recent advances leverage pre-trained language models (PLMs) to
bridge the semantic gap between unstructured natural language (NL) and
structured programming languages (PL), yielding significant improvements over
traditional information retrieval and early deep learning approaches. However,
existing PLM-based methods still encounter key challenges, including a
fundamental semantic gap between human intent and machine execution logic, as
well as limited robustness to diverse code styles. To address these issues, we
propose PseudoBridge, a novel code retrieval framework that introduces
pseudo-code as an intermediate, semi-structured modality to better align NL
semantics with PL logic. Specifically, PseudoBridge consists of two stages.
First, we employ an advanced large language model (LLM) to synthesize
pseudo-code, enabling explicit alignment between NL queries and pseudo-code.
Second, we introduce a logic-invariant code style augmentation strategy and
employ the LLM to generate stylistically diverse yet logically equivalent code
implementations with pseudo-code, then align the code snippets of different
styles with pseudo-code, enhancing model robustness to code style variation. We
build PseudoBridge across 10 different PLMs and evaluate it on 6 mainstream
programming languages. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PseudoBridge
consistently outperforms baselines, achieving significant gains in retrieval
accuracy and generalization, particularly under zero-shot domain transfer
scenarios such as Solidity and XLCoST datasets. These results demonstrate the
effectiveness of explicit logical alignment via pseudo-code and highlight
PseudoBridge's potential as a robust, generalizable solution for code
retrieval.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的AI调试工具容易导致学生对AI过度依赖，没有真正参与调试过程。需要设计一个既能有效修复错误又能促进学生主动学习的调试工具。

Method: 结合传统调试工具和基于LLM的技术，设计CodeHinter调试助手，通过第二版设计迭代并在本科生群体中进行测试。

Result: 学生认为该工具在解决语义错误方面非常有效，比第一版显著更容易使用。错误定位是最有价值的功能。

Conclusion: AI辅助调试工具应该基于用户画像进行个性化定制，以优化与学生的互动效果。

Abstract: Debugging is a fundamental skill that novice programmers must develop.
Numerous tools have been created to assist novice programmers in this process.
Recently, large language models (LLMs) have been integrated with automated
program repair techniques to generate fixes for students' buggy code. However,
many of these tools foster an over-reliance on AI and do not actively engage
students in the debugging process. In this work, we aim to design an intuitive
debugging assistant, CodeHinter, that combines traditional debugging tools with
LLM-based techniques to help novice debuggers fix semantic errors while
promoting active engagement in the debugging process. We present findings from
our second design iteration, which we tested with a group of undergraduate
students. Our results indicate that the students found the tool highly
effective in resolving semantic errors and significantly easier to use than the
first version. Consistent with our previous study, error localization was the
most valuable feature. Finally, we conclude that any AI-assisted debugging tool
should be personalized based on user profiles to optimize their interactions
with students.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量子开发者面临优化量子计算和量子软件工程概念的挑战，需要识别和分类他们在Stack Overflow等平台上讨论的常见问题，以帮助更好地组织讨论内容。

Method: 从问答平台提取2829个量子相关标签的问题，通过内容分析和扎根理论识别常见挑战类别，使用ChatGPT验证人工标注，然后使用BERT、DistilBERT和RoBERTa等Transformer模型进行分类，并与传统深度学习模型比较。

Result: Transformer模型（特别是BERT）平均准确率达到95%，优于传统深度学习模型（FNN 89%、CNN 86%、LSTM 84%），准确率提升6%。使用SHAP进行模型可解释性分析。

Conclusion: 基于Transformer的方法能有效分类量子软件工程挑战，有助于量子供应商和论坛更好地组织讨论内容。但需要与实际开发者和供应商进行实证评估研究。

Abstract: Quantum Software Engineering (QSE) is a research area practiced by tech
firms. Quantum developers face challenges in optimizing quantum computing and
QSE concepts. They use Stack Overflow (SO) to discuss challenges and label
posts with specialized quantum tags, which often refer to technical aspects
rather than developer posts. Categorizing questions based on quantum concepts
can help identify frequent QSE challenges. We conducted studies to classify
questions into various challenges. We extracted 2829 questions from Q&A
platforms using quantum-related tags. Posts were analyzed to identify frequent
challenges and develop a novel grounded theory. Challenges include Tooling,
Theoretical, Learning, Conceptual, Errors, and API Usage. Through content
analysis and grounded theory, discussions were annotated with common challenges
to develop a ground truth dataset. ChatGPT validated human annotations and
resolved disagreements. Fine-tuned transformer algorithms, including BERT,
DistilBERT, and RoBERTa, classified discussions into common challenges. We
achieved an average accuracy of 95% with BERT DistilBERT, compared to
fine-tuned Deep and Machine Learning (D&ML) classifiers, including Feedforward
Neural Networks (FNN), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), and Long Short-Term
Memory networks (LSTM), which achieved accuracies of 89%, 86%, and 84%,
respectively. The Transformer-based approach outperforms the D&ML-based
approach with a 6\% increase in accuracy by processing actual discussions,
i.e., without data augmentation. We applied SHAP (SHapley Additive
exPlanations) for model interpretability, revealing how linguistic features
drive predictions and enhancing transparency in classification. These findings
can help quantum vendors and forums better organize discussions for improved
access and readability. However,empirical evaluation studies with actual
developers and vendors are needed.

TL;DR: MelcotCR是一种基于链式思维（COT）的微调方法，通过长COT技术训练LLMs具备多维度代码审查分析能力，结合最大熵建模和预定义推理路径解决长COT提示中的上下文丢失和推理逻辑丢失问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于代码审查数据微调的LLMs方法受限于训练数据的有限性或模糊性，无法像人类审查者那样同时分析代码审查的多个维度来更好地识别问题。

Method: 提出MelcotCR方法，将最大熵建模原则与预定义推理路径相结合，在长COT提示中更有效地利用上下文知识，同时加强推理过程的逻辑严密性。

Result: 在MelcotCR数据集和公开CodeReviewer数据集上的实证评估显示，使用MelcotCR微调的14B Qwen2.5模型在检测和描述代码问题准确性方面超越了最先进方法，性能与671B DeepSeek-R1模型相当。

Conclusion: MelcotCR方法通过链式思维微调显著提升了LLMs在代码审查任务中的推理能力，证明了小参数模型通过适当方法可以达到甚至超越大模型的性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown great potential in supporting
automated code review due to their impressive capabilities in context
understanding and reasoning. However, these capabilities are still limited
compared to human-level cognition because they are heavily influenced by the
training data. Recent research has demonstrated significantly improved
performance through fine-tuning LLMs with code review data. However, compared
to human reviewers who often simultaneously analyze multiple dimensions of code
review to better identify issues, the full potential of these methods is
hampered by the limited or vague information used to fine-tune the models. This
paper contributes MelcotCR, a chain-of-thought (COT) fine-tuning approach that
trains LLMs with an impressive reasoning ability to analyze multiple dimensions
of code review by harnessing long COT techniques to provide rich structured
information. To address context loss and reasoning logic loss issues that
frequently occur when LLMs process long COT prompts, we propose a solution that
combines the Maximum Entropy (ME) modeling principle with pre-defined reasoning
pathways in MelcotCR to enable more effective utilization of in-context
knowledge within long COT prompts while strengthening the logical tightness of
the reasoning process. Empirical evaluations on our curated MelcotCR dataset
and the public CodeReviewer dataset reveal that a low-parameter base model,
such as 14B Qwen2.5, fine-tuned with MelcotCR can surpass state-of-the-art
methods in terms of the accuracy of detecting and describing code issues, with
its performance remarkably on par with that of the 671B DeepSeek-R1 model.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 政府数字平台（如Brasil Participativo）上的公民参与内容数量庞大，但难以有效利用，主要挑战包括：人工分类不可行、需要专家参与、需与官方分类体系对齐。

Method: 采用BERTopic主题建模方法，结合种子词引导和大型语言模型进行自动验证，减少人工干预。

Result: 初步结果显示，生成的主题具有连贯性且与机构分类体系对齐，仅需极少人工努力。

Conclusion: 该方法能将大量公民输入转化为可用于公共政策的可操作数据，为政府决策提供支持。

Abstract: Promoting participation on digital platforms such as Brasil Participativo has
emerged as a top priority for governments worldwide. However, due to the sheer
volume of contributions, much of this engagement goes underutilized, as
organizing it presents significant challenges: (1) manual classification is
unfeasible at scale; (2) expert involvement is required; and (3) alignment with
official taxonomies is necessary. In this paper, we introduce an approach that
combines BERTopic with seed words and automatic validation by large language
models. Initial results indicate that the generated topics are coherent and
institutionally aligned, with minimal human effort. This methodology enables
governments to transform large volumes of citizen input into actionable data
for public policy.
