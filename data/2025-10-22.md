### [1] [MAT-Agent: Adaptive Multi-Agent Training Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17845)
*Jusheng Zhang,Kaitong Cai,Yijia Fan,Ningyuan Liu,Keze Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了MAT-Agent多智能体框架，通过动态调整数据增强、优化器、学习率和损失函数，使用非平稳多臂老虎机算法平衡探索与利用，在多标签图像分类任务上实现了优越性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多标签图像分类方法依赖静态配置，在动态环境中表现不佳，需要自适应训练策略来应对复杂的视觉语义场景变化。

Method: 部署自主智能体动态调优训练参数，采用非平稳多臂老虎机算法，结合双速率指数移动平均平滑和混合精度训练，通过综合奖励函数平衡准确率、稀有类别性能和训练稳定性。

Result: 在Pascal VOC上达到97.4 mAP（优于PAT-T的96.2），在COCO上达到92.8 mAP（优于HSQ-CvN的92.0），在VG-256上达到60.9 mAP，并展示了加速收敛和强大的跨域泛化能力。

Conclusion: MAT-Agent为优化复杂视觉模型提供了可扩展的智能解决方案，推动了自适应深度学习的进步。

Abstract: Multi-label image classification demands adaptive training strategies to
navigate complex, evolving visual-semantic landscapes, yet conventional methods
rely on static configurations that falter in dynamic settings. We propose
MAT-Agent, a novel multi-agent framework that reimagines training as a
collaborative, real-time optimization process. By deploying autonomous agents
to dynamically tune data augmentation, optimizers, learning rates, and loss
functions, MAT-Agent leverages non-stationary multi-armed bandit algorithms to
balance exploration and exploitation, guided by a composite reward harmonizing
accuracy, rare-class performance, and training stability. Enhanced with
dual-rate exponential moving average smoothing and mixed-precision training, it
ensures robustness and efficiency. Extensive experiments across Pascal VOC,
COCO, and VG-256 demonstrate MAT-Agent's superiority: it achieves an mAP of
97.4 (vs. 96.2 for PAT-T), OF1 of 92.3, and CF1 of 91.4 on Pascal VOC; an mAP
of 92.8 (vs. 92.0 for HSQ-CvN), OF1 of 88.2, and CF1 of 87.1 on COCO; and an
mAP of 60.9, OF1 of 70.8, and CF1 of 61.1 on VG-256. With accelerated
convergence and robust cross-domain generalization, MAT-Agent offers a
scalable, intelligent solution for optimizing complex visual models, paving the
way for adaptive deep learning advancements.

### [2] [CoIDO: Efficient Data Selection for Visual Instruction Tuning via Coupled Importance-Diversity Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17847)
*Yichen Yan,Ming Zhong,Qi Zhu,Xiaoling Gu,Jinpeng Chen,Huan Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoIDO是一个新颖的双目标框架，通过联合优化数据重要性和多样性来高效选择指令调优数据，仅使用20%随机样本训练轻量级评分器，就能达到全数据微调98.2%的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型依赖指令调优，但大规模数据集训练的计算成本高昂。现有数据选择方法存在计算开销大和重要性-多样性分离处理的问题。

Method: 提出CoIDO框架，使用轻量级插件评分器，仅需小规模随机样本学习候选集分布，通过同方差不确定性公式平衡重要性和多样性。

Result: 在LLaVA-1.5-7B模型的10个下游任务中，使用CoIDO选择的20%数据子集达到了全数据微调平均98.2%的性能。

Conclusion: CoIDO能够高效、可扩展地选择指令调优数据，大幅降低计算需求的同时保持优异性能。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) rely heavily on instruction tuning
to align vision and language capabilities, yet the computational cost of
training on large-scale datasets remains a major bottleneck. Existing data
selection methods aim to mitigate this by selecting important and diverse
subsets, but they often suffer from two critical drawbacks: high computational
overhead from processing the entire dataset and suboptimal data selection due
to separate treatment of importance and diversity.
  We introduce CoIDO, a novel dual-objective framework that jointly optimizes
data importance and diversity to overcome these challenges. Unlike existing
approaches that require costly evaluations across the whole dataset, CoIDO
employs a lightweight plug-in scorer. This scorer is trained on just a small
random sample of data to learn the distribution of the candidate set,
drastically reducing computational demands. By leveraging a homoscedastic
uncertainty-based formulation, CoIDO effectively balances importance and
diversity during training, enabling efficient and scalable data selection.
  In our experiments, we trained the CoIDO scorer using only 20 percent of
randomly sampled data. Once trained, CoIDO was applied to the entire dataset to
select a 20 percent subset for instruction tuning. On the widely used
LLaVA-1.5-7B model across ten downstream tasks, this selected subset achieved
an impressive 98.2 percent of the performance of full-data fine-tuning, on
average.

### [3] [Pre to Post-Treatment Glioblastoma MRI Prediction using a Latent Diffusion Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17851)
*Alexandre G. Leclercq,Sébastien Bougleux,Noémie N. Moreau,Alexis Desmonts,Romain Hérault,Aurélien Corroyer-Dulmont*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于潜在扩散模型的早期视觉治疗反应预测方法，通过从治疗前MRI生成治疗后MRI来预测胶质母细胞瘤的治疗反应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 胶质母细胞瘤患者对治疗反应高度异质，传统方法需要至少两个月才能通过MRI观察到治疗效果。早期预测治疗反应对推进个性化医疗至关重要。

Method: 使用潜在扩散模型，通过治疗前MRI和肿瘤定位的串联条件化，以及基于生存信息的无分类器引导来增强生成质量。

Result: 在包含140名胶质母细胞瘤患者的本地数据集上进行了训练和测试，数据集包括治疗前后T1-Gd MRI、专家手动勾画的肿瘤定位和生存信息。

Conclusion: 该方法能够从单次治疗前MRI预测治疗后肿瘤演变，为早期治疗反应评估提供了新途径。

Abstract: Glioblastoma (GBM) is an aggressive primary brain tumor with a median
survival of approximately 15 months. In clinical practice, the Stupp protocol
serves as the standard first-line treatment. However, patients exhibit highly
heterogeneous therapeutic responses which required at least two months before
first visual impact can be observed, typically with MRI. Early prediction
treatment response is crucial for advancing personalized medicine. Disease
Progression Modeling (DPM) aims to capture the trajectory of disease evolution,
while Treatment Response Prediction (TRP) focuses on assessing the impact of
therapeutic interventions. Whereas most TRP approaches primarly rely on
timeseries data, we consider the problem of early visual TRP as a
slice-to-slice translation model generating post-treatment MRI from a
pre-treatment MRI, thus reflecting the tumor evolution. To address this problem
we propose a Latent Diffusion Model with a concatenation-based conditioning
from the pre-treatment MRI and the tumor localization, and a classifier-free
guidance to enhance generation quality using survival information, in
particular post-treatment tumor evolution. Our model were trained and tested on
a local dataset consisting of 140 GBM patients collected at Centre Fran\c{c}ois
Baclesse. For each patient we collected pre and post T1-Gd MRI, tumor
localization manually delineated in the pre-treatment MRI by medical experts,
and survival information.

### [4] [ImageGem: In-the-wild Generative Image Interaction Dataset for Generative Model Personalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18433)
*Yuanhe Guo,Linxi Xie,Zhuoran Chen,Kangrui Yu,Ryan Po,Guandao Yang,Gordon Wetztein,Hongyi Wen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ImageGem是一个用于研究理解细粒度个人偏好的生成模型的数据集，包含57K用户的真实交互数据，包括242K定制LoRAs、3M文本提示和5M生成图像。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 阻碍开发理解用户偏好的生成模型的关键挑战是缺乏真实世界和细粒度的用户偏好标注数据。

Method: 收集真实用户交互数据构建数据集，训练偏好对齐模型，研究检索模型和视觉语言模型在个性化图像检索和生成模型推荐中的表现，提出在潜在权重空间中编辑定制扩散模型的端到端框架。

Result: 使用ImageGem数据集能够训练更好的偏好对齐模型，并首次实现了生成模型个性化的新范式。

Conclusion: ImageGem数据集为生成模型个性化研究提供了重要基础，推动了理解用户偏好的生成模型发展。

Abstract: We introduce ImageGem, a dataset for studying generative models that
understand fine-grained individual preferences. We posit that a key challenge
hindering the development of such a generative model is the lack of in-the-wild
and fine-grained user preference annotations. Our dataset features real-world
interaction data from 57K users, who collectively have built 242K customized
LoRAs, written 3M text prompts, and created 5M generated images. With user
preference annotations from our dataset, we were able to train better
preference alignment models. In addition, leveraging individual user
preference, we investigated the performance of retrieval models and a
vision-language model on personalized image retrieval and generative model
recommendation. Finally, we propose an end-to-end framework for editing
customized diffusion models in a latent weight space to align with individual
user preferences. Our results demonstrate that the ImageGem dataset enables,
for the first time, a new paradigm for generative model personalization.

### [5] [Provenance of AI-Generated Images: A Vector Similarity and Blockchain-based Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17854)
*Jitendra Sharma,Arthur Carvalho,Suman Bhunia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出基于嵌入的AI图像检测框架，利用图像嵌入和向量相似度区分AI生成图像与真实图像。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着生成式AI和LLMs的快速发展，AI生成的图像越来越逼真，难以与人类创作区分，这对数字内容认证提出了挑战。

Method: 使用五个基准嵌入模型处理多样化的AI和人类生成图像数据集，基于嵌入邻近性假设构建检测系统。

Result: 实验证明该方法具有鲁棒性，中等至高强度扰动对嵌入签名影响最小，扰动图像与原图保持高度相似性。

Conclusion: 该解决方案提供了一个可泛化的AI生成图像检测框架，在准确性和计算效率之间取得平衡。

Abstract: Rapid advancement in generative AI and large language models (LLMs) has
enabled the generation of highly realistic and contextually relevant digital
content. LLMs such as ChatGPT with DALL-E integration and Stable Diffusion
techniques can produce images that are often indistinguishable from those
created by humans, which poses challenges for digital content authentication.
Verifying the integrity and origin of digital data to ensure it remains
unaltered and genuine is crucial to maintaining trust and legality in digital
media. In this paper, we propose an embedding-based AI image detection
framework that utilizes image embeddings and a vector similarity to distinguish
AI-generated images from real (human-created) ones. Our methodology is built on
the hypothesis that AI-generated images demonstrate closer embedding proximity
to other AI-generated content, while human-created images cluster similarly
within their domain. To validate this hypothesis, we developed a system that
processes a diverse dataset of AI and human-generated images through five
benchmark embedding models. Extensive experimentation demonstrates the
robustness of our approach, and our results confirm that moderate to high
perturbations minimally impact the embedding signatures, with perturbed images
maintaining close similarity matches to their original versions. Our solution
provides a generalizable framework for AI-generated image detection that
balances accuracy with computational efficiency.

### [6] [ManzaiSet: A Multimodal Dataset of Viewer Responses to Japanese Manzai Comedy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18014)
*Kazuki Kawamura,Kengo Nakai,Jun Rekimoto*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ManzaiSet是首个大规模日本漫才喜剧观众反应多模态数据集，包含241名参与者的面部视频和音频数据，揭示了三种观众类型和正向观看顺序效应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决情感计算领域的西方中心主义偏见，为开发文化敏感的情感AI和非西方背景的个性化娱乐系统提供数据支持。

Method: 收集241名参与者观看10个专业漫才表演的面部视频和音频数据，使用k均值聚类分析观众类型，进行个体层面观看顺序效应分析，以及自动化幽默分类和观众反应建模。

Result: 识别出三种观众类型：高度稳定欣赏者(72.8%)、低度可变下降者(13.2%)和可变改善者(14.0%)；发现正向观看顺序效应；自动化幽默分类未发现类型间显著差异。

Conclusion: 该数据集支持文化敏感的情感AI开发，揭示了观众反应的异质性，挑战了疲劳假说，为非西方娱乐背景的个性化系统提供了基础。

Abstract: We present ManzaiSet, the first large scale multimodal dataset of viewer
responses to Japanese manzai comedy, capturing facial videos and audio from 241
participants watching up to 10 professional performances in randomized order
(94.6 percent watched >= 8; analyses focus on n=228). This addresses the
Western centric bias in affective computing. Three key findings emerge: (1) k
means clustering identified three distinct viewer types: High and Stable
Appreciators (72.8 percent, n=166), Low and Variable Decliners (13.2 percent,
n=30), and Variable Improvers (14.0 percent, n=32), with heterogeneity of
variance (Brown Forsythe p < 0.001); (2) individual level analysis revealed a
positive viewing order effect (mean slope = 0.488, t(227) = 5.42, p < 0.001,
permutation p < 0.001), contradicting fatigue hypotheses; (3) automated humor
classification (77 instances, 131 labels) plus viewer level response modeling
found no type wise differences after FDR correction. The dataset enables
culturally aware emotion AI development and personalized entertainment systems
tailored to non Western contexts.

### [7] [CMIS-Net: A Cascaded Multi-Scale Individual Standardization Network for Backchannel Agreement Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17855)
*Yuxuan Huang,Kangzhong Wang,Eugene Yujun Fu,Grace Ngai,Peter H. F. Ng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出CMIS-Net网络，通过多尺度个体标准化处理个体差异，在反馈信号检测中实现最先进性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 反馈信号在对话中至关重要，但个体表达差异显著，现有情感识别方法难以处理多尺度行为模式

Method: 使用级联多尺度个体标准化网络，在帧级和序列级去除个体特定中性基线，并引入隐式数据增强模块

Result: CMIS-Net有效处理个体差异和数据不平衡，在反馈信号检测中达到最先进性能

Conclusion: 多尺度个体标准化方法能更好地处理个体行为差异，为开发类人响应AI系统提供重要基础

Abstract: Backchannels are subtle listener responses, such as nods, smiles, or short
verbal cues like "yes" or "uh-huh," which convey understanding and agreement in
conversations. These signals provide feedback to speakers, improve the
smoothness of interaction, and play a crucial role in developing human-like,
responsive AI systems. However, the expression of backchannel behaviors is
often significantly influenced by individual differences, operating across
multiple scales: from instant dynamics such as response intensity (frame-level)
to temporal patterns such as frequency and rhythm preferences (sequence-level).
This presents a complex pattern recognition problem that contemporary emotion
recognition methods have yet to fully address. Particularly, existing
individualized methods in emotion recognition often operate at a single scale,
overlooking the complementary nature of multi-scale behavioral cues. To address
these challenges, we propose a novel Cascaded Multi-Scale Individual
Standardization Network (CMIS-Net) that extracts individual-normalized
backchannel features by removing person-specific neutral baselines from
observed expressions. Operating at both frame and sequence levels, this
normalization allows model to focus on relative changes from each person's
baseline rather than absolute expression values. Furthermore, we introduce an
implicit data augmentation module to address the observed training data
distributional bias, improving model generalization. Comprehensive experiments
and visualizations demonstrate that CMIS-Net effectively handles individual
differences and data imbalance, achieving state-of-the-art performance in
backchannel agreement detection.

### [8] [Shortcutting Pre-trained Flow Matching Diffusion Models is Almost Free Lunch](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17858)
*Xu Cai,Yang Wu,Qianli Chen,Haoran Wu,Lichuan Xiang,Hongkai Wen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种超高效的后训练方法，通过新颖的速度场自蒸馏技术，将大规模预训练的流匹配扩散模型转化为高效的少步采样器，无需重新训练即可实现轨迹跳跃功能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的流匹配模型需要专门的步长嵌入才能实现轨迹跳跃，这与现有模型不兼容，而重新训练的成本几乎与预训练本身一样高。

Method: 基于速度场的自蒸馏方法，无需步长嵌入，通过在线自引导蒸馏快速学习，可在不到一个A100天的训练时间内生成3步Flux模型。

Result: 该方法能够生成高效的少步流模型而不损失质量，并且首次实现了数十亿参数扩散模型的少样本蒸馏（如10个文本-图像对），以几乎零成本获得最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅提供了高效的后训练蒸馏方案，还可以整合到预训练阶段本身，产生天生学习高效少步流的模型。

Abstract: We present an ultra-efficient post-training method for shortcutting
large-scale pre-trained flow matching diffusion models into efficient few-step
samplers, enabled by novel velocity field self-distillation. While shortcutting
in flow matching, originally introduced by shortcut models, offers flexible
trajectory-skipping capabilities, it requires a specialized step-size embedding
incompatible with existing models unless retraining from
scratch$\unicode{x2013}$a process nearly as costly as pretraining itself.
  Our key contribution is thus imparting a more aggressive shortcut mechanism
to standard flow matching models (e.g., Flux), leveraging a unique distillation
principle that obviates the need for step-size embedding. Working on the
velocity field rather than sample space and learning rapidly from self-guided
distillation in an online manner, our approach trains efficiently, e.g.,
producing a 3-step Flux less than one A100 day. Beyond distillation, our method
can be incorporated into the pretraining stage itself, yielding models that
inherently learn efficient, few-step flows without compromising quality. This
capability also enables, to our knowledge, the first few-shot distillation
method (e.g., 10 text-image pairs) for dozen-billion-parameter diffusion
models, delivering state-of-the-art performance at almost free cost.

*Demetrious T. Kutzke,Ying-Kun Wu,Elizabeth Terveen,Junaed Sattar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种混合方法，通过计算机视觉从3D人体关节点生成伪IMU数据，用于水下潜水员异常行为监测，解决传统传感器在水下通信受限的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于图像或IMU的活动识别方法在水下环境中效果不佳，特别是潜水员穿戴传感器与AUV通信时存在无线信号衰减问题，需要新的监测方案来保障潜水员安全。

Method: 利用计算机视觉从视频流中提取3D人体关节点，生成高保真运动数据（伪IMU），并开发分类器识别异常行为（如心脏骤停等医疗紧急情况）。

Result: 在模拟紧急场景实验中，将分类器集成到AUV上，验证了该方法在机器人监测和潜水员安全方面的有效性和实用性。

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了水下环境中的通信限制问题，为潜水员安全监测提供了一种有效的技术方案，能够及时识别医疗紧急情况。

Abstract: Traditional human activity recognition uses either direct image analysis or
data from wearable inertial measurement units (IMUs), but can be ineffective in
challenging underwater environments. We introduce a novel hybrid approach that
bridges this gap to monitor scuba diver safety. Our method leverages computer
vision to generate high-fidelity motion data, effectively creating a
``pseudo-IMU'' from a stream of 3D human joint keypoints. This technique
circumvents the critical problem of wireless signal attenuation in water, which
plagues conventional diver-worn sensors communicating with an Autonomous
Underwater Vehicle (AUV). We apply this system to the vital task of identifying
anomalous scuba diver behavior that signals the onset of a medical emergency
such as cardiac arrest -- a leading cause of scuba diving fatalities. By
integrating our classifier onboard an AUV and conducting experiments with
simulated distress scenarios, we demonstrate the utility and effectiveness of
our method for advancing robotic monitoring and diver safety.

### [10] [Binary Quadratic Quantization: Beyond First-Order Quantization for Real-Valued Matrix Compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18650)
*Kyo Kuroki,Yasuyuki Okoshi,Thiem Van Chu,Kazushi Kawamura,Masato Motomura*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的矩阵量化方法BQQ，使用二元二次表达式进行矩阵近似，在矩阵压缩和神经网络后训练量化中表现出色，在2位量化下优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的一阶量化方法（如均匀量化和二进制编码量化）通过二进制基的线性组合来近似实值矩阵，但表达能力有限。BQQ旨在利用二元二次表达式的表达能力，同时保持极紧凑的数据格式。

Method: 提出Binary Quadratic Quantization (BQQ)方法，使用二元二次表达式进行矩阵量化，不依赖PTQ特定的二进制矩阵优化。

Result: 在矩阵压缩基准测试中，BQQ在内存效率和重建误差之间实现了优于传统方法的权衡。在后训练量化中，在ImageNet数据集上，校准和无数据场景下分别比现有最优方法提升2.2%和59.1%，量化等效为2位。

Conclusion: 二元二次表达式在高效矩阵近似和神经网络压缩方面具有显著有效性，BQQ方法在保持紧凑数据格式的同时提供了优越的性能。

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel matrix quantization method, Binary Quadratic
Quantization (BQQ). In contrast to conventional first-order quantization
approaches, such as uniform quantization and binary coding quantization, that
approximate real-valued matrices via linear combinations of binary bases, BQQ
leverages the expressive power of binary quadratic expressions while
maintaining an extremely compact data format. We validate our approach with two
experiments: a matrix compression benchmark and post-training quantization
(PTQ) on pretrained Vision Transformer-based models. Experimental results
demonstrate that BQQ consistently achieves a superior trade-off between memory
efficiency and reconstruction error than conventional methods for compressing
diverse matrix data. It also delivers strong PTQ performance, even though we
neither target state-of-the-art PTQ accuracy under tight memory constraints nor
rely on PTQ-specific binary matrix optimization. For example, our proposed
method outperforms the state-of-the-art PTQ method by up to 2.2\% and 59.1% on
the ImageNet dataset under the calibration-based and data-free scenarios,
respectively, with quantization equivalent to 2 bits. These findings highlight
the surprising effectiveness of binary quadratic expressions for efficient
matrix approximation and neural network compression.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: InsideOut扩展了3D高斯泼溅技术，融合RGB和X射线成像，解决了两种模态数据表示差异和配对数据集有限的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RGB和X射线成像融合在医疗诊断、文化遗产修复和制造等领域具有重要价值，但存在数据表示差异和配对数据有限的挑战。

Method: 收集新的配对RGB和X射线数据，执行分层拟合来对齐RGB和X射线辐射高斯泼溅，并提出X射线参考损失以确保一致的内部结构。

Result: 有效解决了两种模态间的数据表示差异问题，显著扩展了3D高斯泼溅技术的应用范围。

Conclusion: 该方法增强了可视化、仿真和无损检测能力，在多个领域具有广泛应用前景。

Abstract: We introduce InsideOut, an extension of 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) that
bridges the gap between high-fidelity RGB surface details and subsurface X-ray
structures. The fusion of RGB and X-ray imaging is invaluable in fields such as
medical diagnostics, cultural heritage restoration, and manufacturing. We
collect new paired RGB and X-ray data, perform hierarchical fitting to align
RGB and X-ray radiative Gaussian splats, and propose an X-ray reference loss to
ensure consistent internal structures. InsideOut effectively addresses the
challenges posed by disparate data representations between the two modalities
and limited paired datasets. This approach significantly extends the
applicability of 3DGS, enhancing visualization, simulation, and non-destructive
testing capabilities across various domains.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MUSE是一个无需训练、基于模型的零样本2D目标检测和分割框架，通过多视角模板渲染、联合相似度度量和不确定性感知先验，在BOP Challenge 2025中取得最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决零样本2D目标检测和分割中模型泛化能力不足的问题，特别是在未见过的3D物体上实现准确检测和分割，而无需额外训练或微调。

Method: 使用3D未见物体的2D多视角模板渲染和2D目标提议提取；整合类别和补丁嵌入，通过广义均值池化归一化；采用结合绝对和相对相似度的联合相似度度量；通过不确定性感知目标先验优化相似度得分。

Result: 在BOP Challenge 2025中排名第一，在Classic Core、H3和Industrial三个赛道均取得最先进性能。

Conclusion: MUSE提供了一个强大且可泛化的零样本2D目标检测和分割框架，无需训练即可实现优异性能。

Abstract: In this work, we introduce MUSE (Model-based Uncertainty-aware Similarity
Estimation), a training-free framework designed for model-based zero-shot 2D
object detection and segmentation. MUSE leverages 2D multi-view templates
rendered from 3D unseen objects and 2D object proposals extracted from input
query images. In the embedding stage, it integrates class and patch embeddings,
where the patch embeddings are normalized using generalized mean pooling (GeM)
to capture both global and local representations efficiently. During the
matching stage, MUSE employs a joint similarity metric that combines absolute
and relative similarity scores, enhancing the robustness of matching under
challenging scenarios. Finally, the similarity score is refined through an
uncertainty-aware object prior that adjusts for proposal reliability. Without
any additional training or fine-tuning, MUSE achieves state-of-the-art
performance on the BOP Challenge 2025, ranking first across the Classic Core,
H3, and Industrial tracks. These results demonstrate that MUSE offers a
powerful and generalizable framework for zero-shot 2D object detection and
segmentation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 光学音乐识别领域缺乏真实标注数据，特别是手写历史乐谱数据稀缺，需要合成数据来训练更好的识别模型。

Method: 实现音乐符号级别的生成对抗网络(GAN)生成手写风格符号，使用Smashcima排版软件将生成的符号组装成完整乐谱。

Result: 生成的符号具有高度的视觉真实感，在合成乐谱生成方面取得了显著进展。

Conclusion: 该方法能够生成逼真的手写风格乐谱符号，为光学音乐识别训练提供了有效的合成数据解决方案。

Abstract: The field of Optical Music Recognition (OMR) is currently hindered by the
scarcity of real annotated data, particularly when dealing with handwritten
historical musical scores. In similar fields, such as Handwritten Text
Recognition, it was proven that synthetic examples produced with image
generation techniques could help to train better-performing recognition
architectures. This study explores the generation of realistic,
handwritten-looking scores by implementing a music symbol-level Generative
Adversarial Network (GAN) and assembling its output into a full score using the
Smashcima engraving software. We have systematically evaluated the visual
fidelity of these generated samples, concluding that the generated symbols
exhibit a high degree of realism, marking significant progress in synthetic
score generation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文分析了五个广泛使用的性别分类数据集，发现都存在严重的交叉性代表性不足问题。作者创建了BalancedFace数据集来平衡人口统计特征，显著提高了性别分类的公平性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 性别分类系统经常继承并放大训练数据中的人口统计不平衡。现有数据集存在显著的交叉性代表性不足问题，导致模型产生偏见。

Method: 首先审计五个广泛使用的数据集，然后在两个相对平衡的数据集上训练分类器。为了解决数据引起的偏见，构建了BalancedFace数据集，通过混合FairFace和UTKFace的图像，并补充其他集合的图像来填补缺失的人口统计空白。

Result: 在BalancedFace上训练的标准分类器将种族子组间的最大真阳性率差距减少了50%以上，并将平均差异影响分数提高了63%接近理想值1.0，同时总体准确率损失最小。

Conclusion: 数据中心的干预具有深远价值，BalancedFace为公平性别分类研究提供了公开可用的资源。

Abstract: Gender classification systems often inherit and amplify demographic
imbalances in their training data. We first audit five widely used gender
classification datasets, revealing that all suffer from significant
intersectional underrepresentation. To measure the downstream impact of these
flaws, we train identical MobileNetV2 classifiers on the two most balanced of
these datasets, UTKFace and FairFace. Our fairness evaluation shows that even
these models exhibit significant bias, misclassifying female faces at a higher
rate than male faces and amplifying existing racial skew. To counter these
data-induced biases, we construct BalancedFace, a new public dataset created by
blending images from FairFace and UTKFace, supplemented with images from other
collections to fill missing demographic gaps. It is engineered to equalize
subgroup shares across 189 intersections of age, race, and gender using only
real, unedited images. When a standard classifier is trained on BalancedFace,
it reduces the maximum True Positive Rate gap across racial subgroups by over
50% and brings the average Disparate Impact score 63% closer to the ideal of
1.0 compared to the next-best dataset, all with a minimal loss of overall
accuracy. These results underline the profound value of data-centric
interventions and provide an openly available resource for fair gender
classification research.

Conclusion: 该方法通过有效整合3D几何先验和类感知机制，成功解决了3D弱监督语义分割中的关键技术瓶颈。

Abstract: 3D weakly supervised semantic segmentation (3D WSSS) aims to achieve semantic
segmentation by leveraging sparse or low-cost annotated data, significantly
reducing reliance on dense point-wise annotations. Previous works mainly employ
class activation maps or pre-trained vision-language models to address this
challenge. However, the low quality of pseudo-labels and the insufficient
exploitation of 3D geometric priors jointly create significant technical
bottlenecks in developing high-performance 3D WSSS models. In this paper, we
propose a simple yet effective 3D weakly supervised semantic segmentation
method that integrates 3D geometric priors into a class-aware guidance
mechanism to generate high-fidelity pseudo labels. Concretely, our designed
methodology first employs Class-Aware Label Refinement module to generate more
balanced and accurate pseudo labels for semantic categrories. This initial
refinement stage focuses on enhancing label quality through category-specific
optimization. Subsequently, the Geometry-Aware Label Refinement component is
developed, which strategically integrates implicit 3D geometric constraints to
effectively filter out low-confidence pseudo labels that fail to comply with
geometric plausibility. Moreover, to address the challenge of extensive
unlabeled regions, we propose a Label Update strategy that integrates
Self-Training to propagate labels into these areas. This iterative process
continuously enhances pseudo-label quality while expanding label coverage,
ultimately fostering the development of high-performance 3D WSSS models.
Comprehensive experimental validation reveals that our proposed methodology
achieves state-of-the-art performance on both ScanNet and S3DIS benchmarks
while demonstrating remarkable generalization capability in unsupervised
settings, maintaining competitive accuracy through its robust design.

TL;DR: 评估四种分割模型在MRI图像中分割伏隔核时的公平性问题，发现种族匹配训练能提高某些模型的分割准确性，而nnU-Net表现稳健不受人口统计匹配影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像分割算法存在内在数据偏见，基于种族和性别等敏感属性的性能差异日益受到关注，需要评估分割模型的公平性。

Method: 使用三种深度学习分割模型（UNesT、nnU-Net、CoTr）和传统图谱方法（ANTs），在包含四个人口统计子组的数据集上评估伏隔核分割性能，采用公平性度量指标和线性混合模型分析。

Result: 在种族匹配训练时，ANTs和UNesT的分割准确性显著提高，而nnU-Net表现稳健不受人口统计匹配影响。性别效应在手动分割和偏置模型中都能观察到，但种族效应在除一个模型外的所有模型中消失。

Conclusion: 医学图像分割模型存在人口统计偏见，种族匹配训练能改善某些模型的性能，而nnU-Net展示了更好的公平性表现，需要在模型开发中考虑公平性问题。

Abstract: Deep-learning-based segmentation algorithms have substantially advanced the
field of medical image analysis, particularly in structural delineations in
MRIs. However, an important consideration is the intrinsic bias in the data.
Concerns about unfairness, such as performance disparities based on sensitive
attributes like race and sex, are increasingly urgent. In this work, we
evaluate the results of three different segmentation models (UNesT, nnU-Net,
and CoTr) and a traditional atlas-based method (ANTs), applied to segment the
left and right nucleus accumbens (NAc) in MRI images. We utilize a dataset
including four demographic subgroups: black female, black male, white female,
and white male. We employ manually labeled gold-standard segmentations to train
and test segmentation models. This study consists of two parts: the first
assesses the segmentation performance of models, while the second measures the
volumes they produce to evaluate the effects of race, sex, and their
interaction. Fairness is quantitatively measured using a metric designed to
quantify fairness in segmentation performance. Additionally, linear mixed
models analyze the impact of demographic variables on segmentation accuracy and
derived volumes. Training on the same race as the test subjects leads to
significantly better segmentation accuracy for some models. ANTs and UNesT show
notable improvements in segmentation accuracy when trained and tested on
race-matched data, unlike nnU-Net, which demonstrates robust performance
independent of demographic matching. Finally, we examine sex and race effects
on the volume of the NAc using segmentations from the manual rater and from our
biased models. Results reveal that the sex effects observed with manual
segmentation can also be observed with biased models, whereas the race effects
disappear in all but one model.

Abstract: Engagement detection in online learning environments is vital for improving
student outcomes and personalizing instruction. We present ViBED-Net
(Video-Based Engagement Detection Network), a novel deep learning framework
designed to assess student engagement from video data using a dual-stream
architecture. ViBED-Net captures both facial expressions and full-scene context
by processing facial crops and entire video frames through EfficientNetV2 for
spatial feature extraction. These features are then analyzed over time using
two temporal modeling strategies: Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and
Transformer encoders. Our model is evaluated on the DAiSEE dataset, a
large-scale benchmark for affective state recognition in e-learning. To enhance
performance on underrepresented engagement classes, we apply targeted data
augmentation techniques. Among the tested variants, ViBED-Net with LSTM
achieves 73.43\% accuracy, outperforming existing state-of-the-art approaches.
ViBED-Net demonstrates that combining face-aware and scene-aware spatiotemporal
cues significantly improves engagement detection accuracy. Its modular design
allows flexibility for application across education, user experience research,

Motivation: 自动驾驶系统对罕见、分布外场景中的语义异常高度脆弱，现有视觉语言模型的提示方法性能不可靠且依赖昂贵的专有模型，限制了实际部署。

Method: 采用结构化推理框架，包含结构化场景描述提取和多模态评估两阶段流程，在四个语义层（街道、基础设施、可移动对象、环境）进行系统性分析。

Result: 在真实驾驶场景中达到89.6%召回率和88.0%准确率，显著优于非结构化基线。微调后的7B参数开源模型达到90.8%召回率和93.8%准确率，超越所有评估模型。

Conclusion: SAVANT解决了异常检测中的数据稀缺问题，为自动驾驶系统提供了可靠、可访问的语义监控实用路径，支持本地部署且成本极低。

Abstract: Autonomous driving systems remain critically vulnerable to the long-tail of
rare, out-of-distribution scenarios with semantic anomalies. While Vision
Language Models (VLMs) offer promising reasoning capabilities, naive prompting
approaches yield unreliable performance and depend on expensive proprietary
models, limiting practical deployment. We introduce SAVANT (Semantic Analysis
with Vision-Augmented Anomaly deTection), a structured reasoning framework that
achieves high accuracy and recall in detecting anomalous driving scenarios from
input images through layered scene analysis and a two-phase pipeline:
structured scene description extraction followed by multi-modal evaluation. Our
approach transforms VLM reasoning from ad-hoc prompting to systematic analysis
across four semantic layers: Street, Infrastructure, Movable Objects, and
Environment. SAVANT achieves 89.6% recall and 88.0% accuracy on real-world
driving scenarios, significantly outperforming unstructured baselines. More
importantly, we demonstrate that our structured framework enables a fine-tuned
7B parameter open-source model (Qwen2.5VL) to achieve 90.8% recall and 93.8%
accuracy - surpassing all models evaluated while enabling local deployment at
near-zero cost. By automatically labeling over 9,640 real-world images with
high accuracy, SAVANT addresses the critical data scarcity problem in anomaly
detection and provides a practical path toward reliable, accessible semantic
monitoring for autonomous systems.

Abstract: The red palm mite infestation has become a serious concern, particularly in
regions with extensive palm cultivation, leading to reduced productivity and
economic losses. Accurate and early identification of mite-infested plants is
critical for effective management. The current study focuses on evaluating and
comparing the ML model for classifying the affected plants and detecting the
infestation. TriggerNet is a novel interpretable AI framework that integrates
Grad-CAM, RISE, FullGrad, and TCAV to generate novel visual explanations for
deep learning models in plant classification and disease detection. This study
applies TriggerNet to address red palm mite (Raoiella indica) infestation, a
major threat to palm cultivation and agricultural productivity. A diverse set
of RGB images across 11 plant species, Arecanut, Date Palm, Bird of Paradise,
Coconut Palm, Ginger, Citrus Tree, Palm Oil, Orchid, Banana Palm, Avocado Tree,
and Cast Iron Plant was utilized for training and evaluation. Advanced deep
learning models like CNN, EfficientNet, MobileNet, ViT, ResNet50, and
InceptionV3, alongside machine learning classifiers such as Random Forest, SVM,
and KNN, were employed for plant classification. For disease classification,
all plants were categorized into four classes: Healthy, Yellow Spots, Reddish
Bronzing, and Silk Webbing. Snorkel was used to efficiently label these disease
classes by leveraging heuristic rules and patterns, reducing manual annotation
time and improving dataset reliability.

Abstract: We introduce HouseTour, a method for spatially-aware 3D camera trajectory and
natural language summary generation from a collection of images depicting an
existing 3D space. Unlike existing vision-language models (VLMs), which
struggle with geometric reasoning, our approach generates smooth video
trajectories via a diffusion process constrained by known camera poses and
integrates this information into the VLM for 3D-grounded descriptions. We
synthesize the final video using 3D Gaussian splatting to render novel views
along the trajectory. To support this task, we present the HouseTour dataset,
which includes over 1,200 house-tour videos with camera poses, 3D
reconstructions, and real estate descriptions. Experiments demonstrate that
incorporating 3D camera trajectories into the text generation process improves
performance over methods handling each task independently. We evaluate both
individual and end-to-end performance, introducing a new joint metric. Our work
enables automated, professional-quality video creation for real estate and
touristic applications without requiring specialized expertise or equipment.

Abstract: Personalized image generative models are highly proficient at synthesizing
images from text or a single image, yet they lack explicit control for
composing objects from specific parts of multiple source images without user
specified masks or annotations. To address this, we introduce Chimera, a
personalized image generation model that generates novel objects by combining
specified parts from different source images according to textual instructions.
To train our model, we first construct a dataset from a taxonomy built on 464
unique (part, subject) pairs, which we term semantic atoms. From this, we
generate 37k prompts and synthesize the corresponding images with a
high-fidelity text-to-image model. We train a custom diffusion prior model with
part-conditional guidance, which steers the image-conditioning features to
enforce both semantic identity and spatial layout. We also introduce an
objective metric PartEval to assess the fidelity and compositional accuracy of
generation pipelines. Human evaluations and our proposed metric show that
Chimera outperforms other baselines by 14% in part alignment and compositional
accuracy and 21% in visual quality.

Conclusion: 机器学习与SEM成像结合在微塑料检测中具有潜力，但需要解决数据标注不足等挑战才能实现可靠应用。

Abstract: Microplastics (MPs) are ubiquitous pollutants with demonstrated potential to
impact ecosystems and human health. Their microscopic size complicates
detection, classification, and removal, especially in biological and
environmental samples. While techniques like optical microscopy, Scanning
Electron Microscopy (SEM), and Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) provide a sound
basis for detection, applying these approaches requires usually manual analysis
and prevents efficient use in large screening studies. To this end, machine
learning (ML) has emerged as a powerful tool in advancing microplastic
detection. In this exploratory study, we investigate potential, limitations and
future directions of advancing the detection and quantification of MP particles
and fibres using a combination of SEM imaging and machine learning-based object
detection. For simplicity, we focus on a filtration scenario where image
backgrounds exhibit a symmetric and repetitive pattern. Our findings indicate
differences in the quality of YOLO models for the given task and the relevance
of optimizing preprocessing. At the same time, we identify open challenges,
such as limited amounts of expert-labeled data necessary for reliable training
of ML models.

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) partition input images into uniformly sized
patches regardless of their content, resulting in long input sequence lengths
for high-resolution images. We present Adaptive Patch Transformers (APT), which
addresses this by using multiple different patch sizes within the same image.
APT reduces the total number of input tokens by allocating larger patch sizes
in more homogeneous areas and smaller patches in more complex ones. APT
achieves a drastic speedup in ViT inference and training, increasing throughput
by 40% on ViT-L and 50% on ViT-H while maintaining downstream performance, and
can be applied to a previously fine-tuned ViT, converging in as little as 1

of performance in high-resolution dense visual tasks, achieving up to 30\%
faster training and inference in visual QA, object detection, and semantic
segmentation.

Abstract: The problem of 3D reconstruction from posed images is undergoing a
fundamental transformation, driven by continuous advances in 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS). By modeling scenes explicitly as collections of 3D Gaussians,
3DGS enables efficient rasterization through volumetric splatting, offering
thus a seamless integration with common graphics pipelines. Despite its
real-time rendering capabilities for novel view synthesis, 3DGS suffers from a
high memory footprint, the tendency to bake lighting effects directly into its
representation, and limited support for secondary-ray effects. This tutorial
provides a concise yet comprehensive overview of the 3DGS pipeline, starting
from its splatting formulation and then exploring the main efforts in
addressing its limitations. Finally, we survey a range of applications that
leverage 3DGS for surface reconstruction, avatar modeling, animation, and
content generation-highlighting its efficient rendering and suitability for
feed-forward pipelines.

Conclusion: 该方法为低资源环境下的视觉语言模型部署提供了高效解决方案，通过上下文蒸馏显著缩小大小模型之间的性能差距。

Abstract: As the field continues its push for ever more resources, this work turns the
spotlight on a critical question: how can vision-language models (VLMs) be
adapted to thrive in low-resource, budget-constrained settings? While large
VLMs offer strong performance, they are impractical to deploy in such settings.
Small VLMs, on the other hand, are efficient but typically require costly
fine-tuning to close the performance gap with larger models in the deployment
domain. Inspired by the in-context learning framework, we propose an online
In-Context Distillation (ICD) method, in which a small VLM collaborates with a
stronger teacher model at inference time, distilling its knowledge via sparse
demonstrations to efficiently bridge the gap between them. Our method is built
on an in-depth analysis that identifies the scale and the choice of models for
which vision-language ICL is currently feasible, and demonstrates the advantage
of ICL over fine-tuning under constrained compute budgets. We enhance our
method with a novel cross-modal demonstration selection strategy, teacher
test-time scaling to reduce noise, and student uncertainty conditioning to
dynamically populate a demonstration pool and minimize teacher queries. Our ICD
method significantly boosts the performance of small models (up to 33%) using
scarce teacher annotations (as low as 4%), and competes with the teacher's
zero-shot performance.

Abstract: Collaborative driving systems leverage vehicle-to-everything (V2X)
communication across multiple agents to enhance driving safety and efficiency.
Traditional V2X systems take raw sensor data, neural features, or perception
results as communication media, which face persistent challenges, including
high bandwidth demands, semantic loss, and interoperability issues. Recent
advances investigate natural language as a promising medium, which can provide
semantic richness, decision-level reasoning, and human-machine interoperability
at significantly lower bandwidth. Despite great promise, this paradigm shift
also introduces new vulnerabilities within language communication, including
message loss, hallucinations, semantic manipulation, and adversarial attacks.
In this work, we present the first systematic study of full-stack safety and
security issues in natural-language-based collaborative driving. Specifically,
we develop a comprehensive taxonomy of attack strategies, including connection
disruption, relay/replay interference, content spoofing, and multi-connection
forgery. To mitigate these risks, we introduce an agentic defense pipeline,
which we call SafeCoop, that integrates a semantic firewall,
language-perception consistency checks, and multi-source consensus, enabled by
an agentic transformation function for cross-frame spatial alignment. We
systematically evaluate SafeCoop in closed-loop CARLA simulation across 32
critical scenarios, achieving 69.15% driving score improvement under malicious
attacks and up to 67.32% F1 score for malicious detection. This study provides
guidance for advancing research on safe, secure, and trustworthy

Abstract: Generative world models (WMs) can now simulate worlds with striking visual
realism, which naturally raises the question of whether they can endow embodied
agents with predictive perception for decision making. Progress on this
question has been limited by fragmented evaluation: most existing benchmarks
adopt open-loop protocols that emphasize visual quality in isolation, leaving
the core issue of embodied utility unresolved, i.e., do WMs actually help
agents succeed at embodied tasks? To address this gap, we introduce
World-in-World, the first open platform that benchmarks WMs in a closed-loop
world that mirrors real agent-environment interactions. World-in-World provides
a unified online planning strategy and a standardized action API, enabling
heterogeneous WMs for decision making. We curate four closed-loop environments
that rigorously evaluate diverse WMs, prioritize task success as the primary
metric, and move beyond the common focus on visual quality; we also present the
first data scaling law for world models in embodied settings. Our study
uncovers three surprises: (1) visual quality alone does not guarantee task
success, controllability matters more; (2) scaling post-training with
action-observation data is more effective than upgrading the pretrained video
generators; and (3) allocating more inference-time compute allows WMs to
substantially improve closed-loop performance.

TL;DR: 提出了LunarStereo数据集和基于MASt3R模型的月球3D重建方法，解决了月球表面缺乏纹理、光照变化和轨道轨迹等挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有立体视觉重建方法在月球环境下表现不佳，因为月球表面缺乏纹理、光照变化复杂且轨道轨迹特殊，而现有深度学习模型无法直接应用于月球条件。

Method: 创建了LunarStereo数据集（首个月球立体图像对开源数据集），使用光线追踪基于高分辨率地形和反射率模型模拟生成。然后对MASt3R模型在LunarStereo上进行微调，适应月球领域。

Result: 在合成和真实月球数据上的实验验证了方法的有效性，在3D表面重建和相对姿态估计方面相比零样本基线有显著改进。

Conclusion: 该方法为地外环境中稳健的跨尺度泛化铺平了道路，是解决月球3D重建挑战的有效方案。

Abstract: Accurate 3D reconstruction of lunar surfaces is essential for space
exploration. However, existing stereo vision reconstruction methods struggle in
this context due to the Moon's lack of texture, difficult lighting variations,
and atypical orbital trajectories. State-of-the-art deep learning models,
trained on human-scale datasets, have rarely been tested on planetary imagery
and cannot be transferred directly to lunar conditions. To address this issue,
we introduce LunarStereo, the first open dataset of photorealistic stereo image
pairs of the Moon, simulated using ray tracing based on high-resolution
topography and reflectance models. It covers diverse altitudes, lighting
conditions, and viewing angles around the lunar South Pole, offering physically
grounded supervision for 3D reconstruction tasks. Based on this dataset, we
adapt the MASt3R model to the lunar domain through fine-tuning on LunarStereo.
We validate our approach through extensive qualitative and quantitative
experiments on both synthetic and real lunar data, evaluating 3D surface
reconstruction and relative pose estimation. Extensive experiments on synthetic
and real lunar data validate the approach, demonstrating significant
improvements over zero-shot baselines and paving the way for robust cross-scale
generalization in extraterrestrial environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决拥挤场景中因严重遮挡和动态运动模式导致的异常检测挑战，现有方法难以适应不同人群密度且缺乏可解释的异常指标。

Method: 双管道框架：头部检测+密集光流提取个体速度，层次聚类将速度分为停止、慢速、正常、快速四类，基于百分位数的异常评分系统。

Result: 实验证明该框架在密集拥挤环境中能有效实时检测多种异常运动模式。

Conclusion: VelocityNet能够适应不同人群密度，提供可解释的异常指标，在拥挤场景异常检测中表现有效。

Abstract: Detecting anomalies in crowded scenes is challenging due to severe
inter-person occlusions and highly dynamic, context-dependent motion patterns.
Existing approaches often struggle to adapt to varying crowd densities and lack
interpretable anomaly indicators. To address these limitations, we introduce
VelocityNet, a dual-pipeline framework that combines head detection and dense
optical flow to extract person-specific velocities. Hierarchical clustering
categorizes these velocities into semantic motion classes (halt, slow, normal,
and fast), and a percentile-based anomaly scoring system measures deviations
from learned normal patterns. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our
framework in real-time detection of diverse anomalous motion patterns within
densely crowded environments.

TL;DR: 提出了RadDiagSeg数据集和模型，解决医学视觉语言模型无法同时生成诊断文本和像素级分割掩码的问题，实现了异常检测、诊断和灵活分割的联合任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前医学视觉语言模型难以同时生成诊断文本和像素级分割掩码，这限制了临床应用的实用性。需要开发能够同时提供这两种模态输出的辅助系统。

Method: 首先创建RadDiagSeg-D数据集，整合异常检测、诊断和多目标分割任务；然后基于该数据集开发RadDiagSeg-M模型，能够联合执行异常检测、诊断和灵活分割。

Result: RadDiagSeg-M在多目标文本和掩码生成任务的所有组件上都表现出色，建立了稳健且有竞争力的基准。

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了医学视觉语言模型在同时生成诊断文本和分割掩码方面的局限性，为临床辅助诊断提供了丰富的上下文信息。

Abstract: Most current medical vision language models struggle to jointly generate
diagnostic text and pixel-level segmentation masks in response to complex
visual questions. This represents a major limitation towards clinical
application, as assistive systems that fail to provide both modalities
simultaneously offer limited value to medical practitioners. To alleviate this
limitation, we first introduce RadDiagSeg-D, a dataset combining abnormality
detection, diagnosis, and multi-target segmentation into a unified and
hierarchical task. RadDiagSeg-D covers multiple imaging modalities and is
precisely designed to support the development of models that produce
descriptive text and corresponding segmentation masks in tandem. Subsequently,
we leverage the dataset to propose a novel vision-language model, RadDiagSeg-M,
capable of joint abnormality detection, diagnosis, and flexible segmentation.
RadDiagSeg-M provides highly informative and clinically useful outputs,
effectively addressing the need to enrich contextual information for assistive
diagnosis. Finally, we benchmark RadDiagSeg-M and showcase its strong
performance across all components involved in the task of multi-target
text-and-mask generation, establishing a robust and competitive baseline.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EMA-SAM是一种轻量级扩展的SAM-2模型，通过引入置信度加权的指数移动平均指针来提供跨帧稳定的肿瘤潜在原型，显著提高了甲状腺微小乳头状癌超声视频分割的稳定性和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决甲状腺微小乳头状癌射频消融超声视频中由于低对比度、探头运动伪影和热相关伪影导致的病变分割困难问题，以及SAM-2模型帧独立设计在介入超声中产生不稳定预测和时间漂移的问题。

Method: 在SAM-2基础上引入置信度加权的指数移动平均指针到记忆库中，提供跨帧稳定的肿瘤潜在原型，保持时间一致性同时快速适应清晰证据重新出现的情况。

Result: 在PTMC-RFA数据集上，maxDice从0.82提升到0.86，maxIoU从0.72提升到0.76，假阳性减少29%；在外部基准测试中，Dice分数比SAM-2提升2-5个点，同时仅增加<0.1%的FLOPs，在单A100 GPU上保持约30FPS的实时吞吐量。

Conclusion: EMA-SAM建立了一个稳健高效的肿瘤跟踪框架，弥合了基础模型与介入超声严格需求之间的差距。

Abstract: Papillary thyroid microcarcinoma (PTMC) is increasingly managed with
radio-frequency ablation (RFA), yet accurate lesion segmentation in ultrasound
videos remains difficult due to low contrast, probe-induced motion, and
heat-related artifacts. The recent Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM-2) generalizes
well to static images, but its frame-independent design yields unstable
predictions and temporal drift in interventional ultrasound. We introduce
\textbf{EMA-SAM}, a lightweight extension of SAM-2 that incorporates a
confidence-weighted exponential moving average pointer into the memory bank,
providing a stable latent prototype of the tumour across frames. This design
preserves temporal coherence through probe pressure and bubble occlusion while
rapidly adapting once clear evidence reappears. On our curated PTMC-RFA dataset
(124 minutes, 13 patients), EMA-SAM improves \emph{maxDice} from 0.82 (SAM-2)
to 0.86 and \emph{maxIoU} from 0.72 to 0.76, while reducing false positives by
29\%. On external benchmarks, including VTUS and colonoscopy video polyp
datasets, EMA-SAM achieves consistent gains of 2--5 Dice points over SAM-2.
Importantly, the EMA pointer adds \textless0.1\% FLOPs, preserving real-time
throughput of $\sim$30\,FPS on a single A100 GPU. These results establish
EMA-SAM as a robust and efficient framework for stable tumour tracking,
bridging the gap between foundation models and the stringent demands of
interventional ultrasound. Codes are available here \hyperref[code

TL;DR: 提出了VLSU框架，系统评估多模态模型的安全性，通过细粒度严重性分类和组合分析揭示模型在联合图像-文本理解上的系统性失败。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有安全评估方法将视觉和语言输入分开处理，忽略了联合解释时良性内容组合可能产生有害影响的风险，且无法清晰区分明显不安全内容和边界案例。

Method: 使用多阶段流水线构建包含8,187个样本的大规模基准测试，涵盖15个伤害类别和17种安全模式，对11个最先进模型进行评估。

Result: 模型在清晰单模态安全信号上准确率达90%以上，但在需要联合图像-文本推理时性能大幅下降至20-55%。34%的联合分类错误发生在单模态分类正确的情况下。

Conclusion: VLSU框架暴露了当前模型在联合图像-文本理解和安全对齐方面的弱点，为稳健视觉语言安全研究提供了关键测试平台。

Abstract: Safety evaluation of multimodal foundation models often treats vision and
language inputs separately, missing risks from joint interpretation where
benign content becomes harmful in combination. Existing approaches also fail to
distinguish clearly unsafe content from borderline cases, leading to
problematic over-blocking or under-refusal of genuinely harmful content. We
present Vision Language Safety Understanding (VLSU), a comprehensive framework
to systematically evaluate multimodal safety through fine-grained severity
classification and combinatorial analysis across 17 distinct safety patterns.
Using a multi-stage pipeline with real-world images and human annotation, we
construct a large-scale benchmark of 8,187 samples spanning 15 harm categories.
Our evaluation of eleven state-of-the-art models reveals systematic joint
understanding failures: while models achieve 90%-plus accuracy on clear
unimodal safety signals, performance degrades substantially to 20-55% when
joint image-text reasoning is required to determine the safety label. Most
critically, 34% of errors in joint image-text safety classification occur
despite correct classification of the individual modalities, further
demonstrating absent compositional reasoning capabilities. Additionally, we
find that models struggle to balance refusing unsafe content while still
responding to borderline cases that deserve engagement. For example, we find
that instruction framing can reduce the over-blocking rate on borderline
content from 62.4% to 10.4% in Gemini-1.5, but only at the cost of
under-refusing on unsafe content with refusal rate dropping from 90.8% to
53.9%. Overall, our framework exposes weaknesses in joint image-text
understanding and alignment gaps in current models, and provides a critical
test bed to enable the next milestones in research on robust vision-language
safety.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出基于生成的物体检测去偏框架，通过表示分数诊断表征差距，使用视觉蓝图和生成对齐策略提升生成质量，显著改善罕见物体检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有去偏方法受限于样本表征多样性，简单的生成增强往往保留原有偏见，且仅增加罕见类别数据量效果有限，因为实例频率不能完全反映模型真实需求，当前布局到图像合成缺乏高质量复杂场景生成能力。

Method: 引入表示分数(RS)诊断超越频率的表征差距，指导创建无偏布局；用精确视觉蓝图替代模糊文本提示，采用生成对齐策略促进检测器与生成器之间的通信。

Result: 显著缩小了代表性不足物体组的性能差距，大/罕见实例相比基线提升4.4/3.6 mAP，在生成图像的布局准确性上比先前L2I合成模型提升15.9 mAP。

Conclusion: 该生成去偏框架通过表征诊断和高质量合成，有效解决了物体检测中的偏见问题，为罕见物体检测提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: This paper presents a generation-based debiasing framework for object
detection. Prior debiasing methods are often limited by the representation
diversity of samples, while naive generative augmentation often preserves the
biases it aims to solve. Moreover, our analysis reveals that simply generating
more data for rare classes is suboptimal due to two core issues: i) instance
frequency is an incomplete proxy for the true data needs of a model, and ii)
current layout-to-image synthesis lacks the fidelity and control to generate
high-quality, complex scenes. To overcome this, we introduce the representation
score (RS) to diagnose representational gaps beyond mere frequency, guiding the
creation of new, unbiased layouts. To ensure high-quality synthesis, we replace
ambiguous text prompts with a precise visual blueprint and employ a generative
alignment strategy, which fosters communication between the detector and
generator. Our method significantly narrows the performance gap for
underrepresented object groups, \eg, improving large/rare instances by 4.4/3.6
mAP over the baseline, and surpassing prior L2I synthesis models by 15.9 mAP
for layout accuracy in generated images.

Motivation: 探索通过光学2D映射压缩长上下文的可行性，解决历史长上下文压缩和LLMs内存遗忘机制等问题。

Method: 采用DeepEncoder作为核心引擎，在高分辨率输入下保持低激活度，实现高压缩比；使用DeepSeek3B-MoE-A570M作为解码器进行OCR识别。

Result: 压缩比<10x时OCR精度97%，20x时精度60%；在OmniDocBench上超越GOT-OCR2.0和MinerU2.0；单A100-40G可日处理20万+页面。

Conclusion: DeepSeek-OCR在长上下文压缩方面展现出巨大潜力，具有高实用价值，可用于LLMs/VLMs训练数据生成，代码和模型权重已开源。

Abstract: We present DeepSeek-OCR as an initial investigation into the feasibility of
compressing long contexts via optical 2D mapping. DeepSeek-OCR consists of two
components: DeepEncoder and DeepSeek3B-MoE-A570M as the decoder. Specifically,
DeepEncoder serves as the core engine, designed to maintain low activations
under high-resolution input while achieving high compression ratios to ensure
an optimal and manageable number of vision tokens. Experiments show that when
the number of text tokens is within 10 times that of vision tokens (i.e., a
compression ratio < 10x), the model can achieve decoding (OCR) precision of
97%. Even at a compression ratio of 20x, the OCR accuracy still remains at
about 60%. This shows considerable promise for research areas such as
historical long-context compression and memory forgetting mechanisms in LLMs.
Beyond this, DeepSeek-OCR also demonstrates high practical value. On
OmniDocBench, it surpasses GOT-OCR2.0 (256 tokens/page) using only 100 vision
tokens, and outperforms MinerU2.0 (6000+ tokens per page on average) while
utilizing fewer than 800 vision tokens. In production, DeepSeek-OCR can
generate training data for LLMs/VLMs at a scale of 200k+ pages per day (a
single A100-40G). Codes and model weights are publicly accessible at
http://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-OCR.

TL;DR: BlendCLIP是一个多模态预训练框架，通过结合合成数据和真实数据的优势来弥合3D物体分类中的合成到真实域差距，使用课程学习的数据混合策略实现高效的零样本性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决3D物体分类中合成训练数据与真实稀疏、噪声LiDAR扫描之间的域差距问题，以及仅使用真实数据训练时语义多样性不足的问题。

Method: 提出生成大规模对象级三元组数据集（点云、图像、文本描述），并采用课程学习的数据混合策略，先在语义丰富的合成CAD数据上训练，再逐步适应真实世界扫描特征。

Result: 仅需在每批次中引入1.5%的真实世界样本，就能在nuScenes基准上提升零样本准确率27%，在nuScenes和TruckScenes上达到最先进性能，比之前最佳方法提升19.3%。

Conclusion: 有效的域适应而非大规模真实世界标注是实现鲁棒开放词汇3D感知的关键。

Abstract: Zero-shot 3D object classification is crucial for real-world applications
like autonomous driving, however it is often hindered by a significant domain
gap between the synthetic data used for training and the sparse, noisy LiDAR
scans encountered in the real-world. Current methods trained solely on
synthetic data fail to generalize to outdoor scenes, while those trained only
on real data lack the semantic diversity to recognize rare or unseen objects.
  We introduce BlendCLIP, a multimodal pretraining framework that bridges this
synthetic-to-real gap by strategically combining the strengths of both domains.
We first propose a pipeline to generate a large-scale dataset of object-level
triplets -- consisting of a point cloud, image, and text description -- mined
directly from real-world driving data and human annotated 3D boxes. Our core
contribution is a curriculum-based data mixing strategy that first grounds the
model in the semantically rich synthetic CAD data before progressively adapting
it to the specific characteristics of real-world scans.
  Our experiments show that our approach is highly label-efficient: introducing
as few as 1.5\% real-world samples per batch into training boosts zero-shot
accuracy on the nuScenes benchmark by 27\%. Consequently, our final model
achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging outdoor datasets like
nuScenes and TruckScenes, improving over the best prior method by 19.3\% on
nuScenes, while maintaining strong generalization on diverse synthetic
benchmarks. Our findings demonstrate that effective domain adaptation, not
full-scale real-world annotation, is the key to unlocking robust
open-vocabulary 3D perception. Our code and dataset will be released upon
acceptance on https://github.com/kesu1/BlendCLIP.

Abstract: Understanding 3D scenes is pivotal for autonomous driving, robotics, and
augmented reality. Recent semantic Gaussian Splatting approaches leverage
large-scale 2D vision models to project 2D semantic features onto 3D scenes.
However, they suffer from two major limitations: (1) insufficient contextual
cues for individual masks during preprocessing and (2) inconsistencies and
missing details when fusing multi-view features from these 2D models. In this
paper, we introduce \textbf{OpenInsGaussian}, an \textbf{Open}-vocabulary
\textbf{Ins}tance \textbf{Gaussian} segmentation framework with Context-aware
Cross-view Fusion. Our method consists of two modules: Context-Aware Feature
Extraction, which augments each mask with rich semantic context, and
Attention-Driven Feature Aggregation, which selectively fuses multi-view
features to mitigate alignment errors and incompleteness. Through extensive
experiments on benchmark datasets, OpenInsGaussian achieves state-of-the-art
results in open-vocabulary 3D Gaussian segmentation, outperforming existing
baselines by a large margin. These findings underscore the robustness and
generality of our proposed approach, marking a significant step forward in 3D
scene understanding and its practical deployment across diverse real-world

Motivation: 现有视频3D人体网格恢复方法通常在欧几里得空间中学习网格特征，难以准确捕捉人体的层次结构（如躯干-肢体-手指），导致重建错误。

Method: 设计时序运动先验提取模块，分别从3D姿态序列和图像特征序列提取时序运动特征并融合；提出双曲空间优化学习策略，利用时序运动先验辅助学习，在双曲空间中分别使用3D姿态和姿态运动信息优化网格特征；提出双曲网格优化损失以保证学习过程的稳定性和有效性。

Result: 在大型公开数据集上的广泛实验结果表明，该方法相比现有最先进方法具有优越性。

Conclusion: 通过双曲空间学习和时序运动先验的结合，能够更准确地恢复3D人体网格，有效捕捉人体层次结构特征。

Abstract: 3D human meshes show a natural hierarchical structure (like
torso-limbs-fingers). But existing video-based 3D human mesh recovery methods
usually learn mesh features in Euclidean space. It's hard to catch this
hierarchical structure accurately. So wrong human meshes are reconstructed. To
solve this problem, we propose a hyperbolic space learning method leveraging
temporal motion prior for recovering 3D human meshes from videos. First, we
design a temporal motion prior extraction module. This module extracts the
temporal motion features from the input 3D pose sequences and image feature
sequences respectively. Then it combines them into the temporal motion prior.
In this way, it can strengthen the ability to express features in the temporal
motion dimension. Since data representation in non-Euclidean space has been
proved to effectively capture hierarchical relationships in real-world datasets
(especially in hyperbolic space), we further design a hyperbolic space
optimization learning strategy. This strategy uses the temporal motion prior
information to assist learning, and uses 3D pose and pose motion information
respectively in the hyperbolic space to optimize and learn the mesh features.
Then, we combine the optimized results to get an accurate and smooth human
mesh. Besides, to make the optimization learning process of human meshes in
hyperbolic space stable and effective, we propose a hyperbolic mesh
optimization loss. Extensive experimental results on large publicly available
datasets indicate superiority in comparison with most state-of-the-art.

Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在自然场景理解方面取得了显著成功，但在水下环境中的应用仍未被充分探索。水下图像存在严重的光衰减、颜色失真和悬浮颗粒散射等独特挑战，且需要海洋生态系统和生物分类学的专业知识。

Method: 构建包含15,003张高分辨率水下图像的UWBench数据集，涵盖不同水生环境，每张图像都包含人工验证的标注：15,281个对象引用表达和124,983个问答对。基于此建立了三个基准：详细图像描述、视觉定位和视觉问答。

Conclusion: UWBench为推进水下环境中的视觉语言研究提供了重要资源，支持海洋科学、生态监测和自主水下探索等应用。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable success in
natural scene understanding, yet their application to underwater environments
remains largely unexplored. Underwater imagery presents unique challenges
including severe light attenuation, color distortion, and suspended particle
scattering, while requiring specialized knowledge of marine ecosystems and
organism taxonomy. To bridge this gap, we introduce UWBench, a comprehensive
benchmark specifically designed for underwater vision-language understanding.
UWBench comprises 15,003 high-resolution underwater images captured across
diverse aquatic environments, encompassing oceans, coral reefs, and deep-sea
habitats. Each image is enriched with human-verified annotations including
15,281 object referring expressions that precisely describe marine organisms
and underwater structures, and 124,983 question-answer pairs covering diverse
reasoning capabilities from object recognition to ecological relationship
understanding. The dataset captures rich variations in visibility, lighting
conditions, and water turbidity, providing a realistic testbed for model
evaluation. Based on UWBench, we establish three comprehensive benchmarks:
detailed image captioning for generating ecologically informed scene
descriptions, visual grounding for precise localization of marine organisms,
and visual question answering for multimodal reasoning about underwater
environments. Extensive experiments on state-of-the-art VLMs demonstrate that
underwater understanding remains challenging, with substantial room for
improvement. Our benchmark provides essential resources for advancing
vision-language research in underwater contexts and supporting applications in
marine science, ecological monitoring, and autonomous underwater exploration.
Our code and benchmark will be available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D人体网格恢复方法未能充分利用潜在信息（如人体运动、形状对齐），导致重建网格出现肢体错位和局部细节不足的问题，且基于注意力机制的网格顶点与姿态节点交互建模计算成本过高。

Method: 采用两阶段网络：第一阶段从图像特征的低频和高频分量中挖掘全局和局部信息，聚合为混合潜在频率域特征；第二阶段利用这些特征通过降维和并行优化设计低维网格姿态交互方法，优化人体网格的姿态和形状。

Result: 在大型公开数据集上的广泛实验结果表明，该方法在重建精度上优于最先进的方法，同时显著降低了计算成本。

Conclusion: 所提出的两阶段网络通过有效提取潜在信息和低维交互学习，在保持高重建精度的同时大幅降低了计算复杂度，为3D人体网格恢复提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Existing 3D human mesh recovery methods often fail to fully exploit the
latent information (e.g., human motion, shape alignment), leading to issues
with limb misalignment and insufficient local details in the reconstructed
human mesh (especially in complex scenes). Furthermore, the performance
improvement gained by modelling mesh vertices and pose node interactions using
attention mechanisms comes at a high computational cost. To address these
issues, we propose a two-stage network for human mesh recovery based on latent
information and low dimensional learning. Specifically, the first stage of the
network fully excavates global (e.g., the overall shape alignment) and local
(e.g., textures, detail) information from the low and high-frequency components
of image features and aggregates this information into a hybrid latent
frequency domain feature. This strategy effectively extracts latent
information. Subsequently, utilizing extracted hybrid latent frequency domain
features collaborates to enhance 2D poses to 3D learning. In the second stage,
with the assistance of hybrid latent features, we model the interaction
learning between the rough 3D human mesh template and the 3D pose, optimizing
the pose and shape of the human mesh. Unlike existing mesh pose interaction
methods, we design a low-dimensional mesh pose interaction method through
dimensionality reduction and parallel optimization that significantly reduces
computational costs without sacrificing reconstruction accuracy. Extensive
experimental results on large publicly available datasets indicate superiority
compared to the most state-of-the-art.

Abstract: In medical image segmentation tasks, Domain Generalization (DG) under the
Federated Learning (FL) framework is crucial for addressing challenges related
to privacy protection and data heterogeneity. However, traditional federated
learning methods fail to account for the imbalance in information aggregation
across clients in cross-domain scenarios, leading to the Global Drift (GD)
problem and a consequent decline in model generalization performance. This
motivates us to delve deeper and define a new critical issue: global drift in
federated domain generalization for medical imaging (FedDG-GD). In this paper,
we propose a novel tree topology framework called TreeFedDG. First, starting
from the distributed characteristics of medical images, we design a
hierarchical parameter aggregation method based on a tree-structured topology
to suppress deviations in the global model direction. Second, we introduce a
parameter difference-based style mixing method (FedStyle), which enforces
mixing among clients with maximum parameter differences to enhance robustness
against drift. Third, we develop a a progressive personalized fusion strategy
during model distribution, ensuring a balance between knowledge transfer and
personalized features. Finally, during the inference phase, we use feature
similarity to guide the retrieval of the most relevant model chain from the
tree structure for ensemble decision-making, thereby fully leveraging the
advantages of hierarchical knowledge. We conducted extensive experiments on two
publicly available datasets. The results demonstrate that our method
outperforms other state-of-the-art domain generalization approaches in these
challenging tasks and achieves better balance in cross-domain performance.

### [41] [StreamingTOM: Streaming Token Compression for Efficient Video Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18269)
*Xueyi Chen,Keda Tao,Kele Shao,Huan Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: StreamingTOM是一个无需训练、即插即用的两阶段框架，通过因果时间缩减和在线量化内存技术，解决流式视频视觉语言模型中的因果性和累积性问题，显著提升效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 流式视频视觉语言模型面临两个基本约束：因果性（无法访问未来帧）和累积性（令牌无限增长导致效率瓶颈）。现有方法仅调控后LLM的kv缓存，而忽略了成本高昂的前LLM预填充阶段。

Method: 提出两阶段框架：1）因果时间缩减：基于相邻帧变化和令牌显著性选择令牌，为每帧设置固定预算，仅处理紧凑的视觉令牌子集；2）在线量化内存：以4位格式存储令牌，按需检索相关组并反量化，保持活跃kv缓存有界。

Result: 实验显示：实现15.7倍kv缓存压缩，峰值内存降低1.2倍，TTFT速度提升2倍。在无需训练方法中保持最先进精度，离线基准测试平均63.8%，RVS测试55.8%/3.7。

Conclusion: StreamingTOM的两阶段方法为高效流式视频理解提供了实用优势，实现了有界增长下的高性能表现。

Abstract: Unlike offline processing, streaming video vision-language models face two
fundamental constraints: causality and accumulation. Causality prevents access
to future frames that offline methods exploit, while accumulation causes tokens
to grow unbounded, creating efficiency bottlenecks. However, existing
approaches only regulate post-LLM kv-cache, leaving costly pre-LLM prefill
unchanged. We introduce StreamingTOM, a training-free, plug-and-play two-stage
framework that addresses both pre-LLM and post-LLM bottlenecks with predictable
latency. Causal Temporal Reduction imposes a fixed per-frame budget and selects
tokens based on adjacent-frame changes and token saliency, drastically reducing
per-frame prefill cost by processing only a compact subset of visual tokens per
frame instead of all visual tokens. Online Quantized Memory stores tokens in
4-bit format, retrieves relevant groups on demand, and dequantizes them,
keeping the active kv-cache bounded regardless of stream length. Experiments
demonstrate our method achieves $15.7\times$ kv-cache compression, $1.2\times$
lower peak memory and $2\times$ faster TTFT compared to prior SOTA.
StreamingTOM maintains state-of-the-art accuracy among training-free methods
with an average of $63.8\%$ on offline benchmarks and $55.8\%/3.7$ on RVS.
These results highlight the practical benefits of our two-stage approach for
efficient streaming video understanding with bounded growth.

### [42] [Efficient Few-shot Identity Preserving Attribute Editing for 3D-aware Deep Generative Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18287)
*Vishal Vinod*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于3D感知生成模型和2D人像编辑技术的少样本身份保持属性编辑方法，通过识别潜在空间方向实现3D人脸的光真实编辑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D人像编辑面临多视角一致性、高分辨率编辑灵活性不足等挑战，需要大规模标注数据集。本文旨在通过少量标注图像估计潜在空间编辑方向，缓解这些约束。

Method: 利用3D感知深度生成模型和2D人像编辑技术，通过10个或更少的标注图像估计潜在空间编辑方向，实现3D感知属性编辑。

Result: 实验结果表明，仅需10个或更少的标注图像即可估计出对应3D感知属性编辑的潜在空间方向，并能实现连续风格流形上的3D一致性身份保持人脸老化。

Conclusion: 该方法能够高效实现少样本身份保持的3D人脸属性编辑，验证了编辑方向的线性特性，为3D人像编辑提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Identity preserving editing of faces is a generative task that enables
modifying the illumination, adding/removing eyeglasses, face aging, editing
hairstyles, modifying expression etc., while preserving the identity of the
face. Recent progress in 2D generative models have enabled photorealistic
editing of faces using simple techniques leveraging the compositionality in
GANs. However, identity preserving editing for 3D faces with a given set of
attributes is a challenging task as the generative model must reason about view
consistency from multiple poses and render a realistic 3D face. Further, 3D
portrait editing requires large-scale attribute labelled datasets and presents
a trade-off between editability in low-resolution and inflexibility to editing
in high resolution. In this work, we aim to alleviate some of the constraints
in editing 3D faces by identifying latent space directions that correspond to
photorealistic edits. To address this, we present a method that builds on
recent advancements in 3D-aware deep generative models and 2D portrait editing
techniques to perform efficient few-shot identity preserving attribute editing
for 3D-aware generative models. We aim to show from experimental results that
using just ten or fewer labelled images of an attribute is sufficient to
estimate edit directions in the latent space that correspond to 3D-aware
attribute editing. In this work, we leverage an existing face dataset with
masks to obtain the synthetic images for few attribute examples required for
estimating the edit directions. Further, to demonstrate the linearity of edits,
we investigate one-shot stylization by performing sequential editing and use
the (2D) Attribute Style Manipulation (ASM) technique to investigate a
continuous style manifold for 3D consistent identity preserving face aging.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合立体视觉引导的度量深度估计框架，通过预训练扩散模型和立体几何约束解决单图像深度估计中的尺度模糊问题，无需重新训练即可提升现有DB-MDE模型的度量深度估计精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于扩散的单目深度估计方法在相对深度预测方面表现出色，但在绝对度量深度估计方面仍面临挑战，主要由于单图像场景中的尺度模糊问题。

Method: 将深度估计重构为逆问题，利用预训练的潜在扩散模型结合RGB图像条件，并引入立体几何约束来学习尺度和偏移参数，实现准确的深度恢复。

Result: 在室内、室外和复杂环境中的广泛实验表明，该方法在具有挑战性的场景（如透明和镜面表面）中达到或超越了最先进方法的性能。

Conclusion: 该训练免费解决方案能够无缝集成到现有DB-MDE框架中，有效解决了度量深度估计的尺度模糊问题，在多种复杂场景下表现出优越性能。

Abstract: We introduce a novel framework for metric depth estimation that enhances
pretrained diffusion-based monocular depth estimation (DB-MDE) models with
stereo vision guidance. While existing DB-MDE methods excel at predicting
relative depth, estimating absolute metric depth remains challenging due to
scale ambiguities in single-image scenarios. To address this, we reframe depth
estimation as an inverse problem, leveraging pretrained latent diffusion models
(LDMs) conditioned on RGB images, combined with stereo-based geometric
constraints, to learn scale and shift for accurate depth recovery. Our
training-free solution seamlessly integrates into existing DB-MDE frameworks
and generalizes across indoor, outdoor, and complex environments. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach matches or surpasses state-of-the-art
methods, particularly in challenging scenarios involving translucent and
specular surfaces, all without requiring retraining.

*Lehan Wang,Yi Qin,Honglong Yang,Xiaomeng Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了首个多模态医疗推理检索框架Med-RwR，通过强化学习策略激励模型主动检索外部知识，提升医疗多模态大语言模型的推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医疗MLLMs仅依赖内部知识进行推理，在遇到超出训练范围的病例时会产生幻觉推理和事实错误，需要整合外部知识来提升推理可靠性。

Method: 采用两阶段强化学习策略，设计定制化奖励机制，激励模型利用视觉诊断发现和文本临床信息进行有效检索，并提出置信度驱动的图像重检索方法。

Result: 在多个公共医疗基准测试中显著优于基线模型，在提出的超声心动图基准上获得8.8%的性能提升，显示出对不熟悉领域的良好泛化能力。

Conclusion: Med-RwR通过外部知识集成有效增强了推理能力，证明了在医疗应用中整合多模态信息和主动检索的重要性。

Abstract: Incentivizing the reasoning ability of Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) is essential for medical applications to transparently analyze medical
scans and provide reliable diagnosis. However, existing medical MLLMs rely
solely on internal knowledge during reasoning, leading to hallucinated
reasoning and factual inaccuracies when encountering cases beyond their
training scope. Although recent Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
methods elicit the medical model's proactive retrieval ability during
reasoning, they are confined to unimodal LLMs, neglecting the crucial visual
information during reasoning and retrieval. Consequently, we propose the first
Multimodal Medical Reasoning-with-Retrieval framework, Med-RwR, which actively
retrieves external knowledge by querying observed symptoms or domain-specific
medical concepts during reasoning. Specifically, we design a two-stage
reinforcement learning strategy with tailored rewards that stimulate the model
to leverage both visual diagnostic findings and textual clinical information
for effective retrieval. Building on this foundation, we further propose a
Confidence-Driven Image Re-retrieval (CDIR) method for test-time scaling when
low prediction confidence is detected. Evaluation on various public medical
benchmarks demonstrates Med-RwR's significant improvements over baseline
models, proving the effectiveness of enhancing reasoning capabilities with
external knowledge integration. Furthermore, Med-RwR demonstrates remarkable
generalizability to unfamiliar domains, evidenced by 8.8% performance gain on
our proposed EchoCardiography Benchmark (ECBench), despite the scarcity of
echocardiography data in the training corpus. Our data, model, and codes will
be made publicly available at https://github.com/xmed-lab/Med-RwR.

TL;DR: 研究发现图像分辨率对生物医学多模态大语言模型性能有重要影响，推荐使用原生分辨率推理和混合分辨率训练来优化模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLMs主要针对低分辨率通用数据集设计，在生物医学高分辨率图像分析中可能导致关键信息丢失，需要研究分辨率对性能的影响。

Method: 通过研究图像分辨率对MLLM性能的影响，包括原生分辨率训练推理、分辨率不匹配问题以及混合分辨率训练方法。

Result: 发现原生分辨率训练推理显著提升性能，训练与推理分辨率不匹配会严重降低性能，混合分辨率训练能有效缓解不匹配问题。

Conclusion: 建议优先采用原生分辨率推理和混合分辨率数据集，以平衡计算约束与性能需求，优化生物医学MLLMs在科研和临床应用中的表现。

Abstract: Imaging technologies are fundamental to biomedical research and modern
medicine, requiring analysis of high-resolution images across various
modalities. While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) show promise for
biomedical image analysis, most are designed for low-resolution images from
general-purpose datasets, risking critical information loss. We investigate how
image resolution affects MLLM performance in biomedical applications and
demonstrate that: (1) native-resolution training and inference significantly
improve performance across multiple tasks, (2) misalignment between training
and inference resolutions severely degrades performance, and (3)
mixed-resolution training effectively mitigates misalignment and balances
computational constraints with performance requirements. Based on these
findings, we recommend prioritizing native-resolution inference and
mixed-resolution datasets to optimize biomedical MLLMs for transformative
impact in scientific research and clinical applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OmniNWM是一个全景导航世界模型，通过统一的框架解决了自动驾驶世界模型在状态、动作和奖励三个维度的限制，实现了高质量的全景视频生成、精确的动作控制和基于3D占据的奖励定义。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动驾驶世界模型存在状态模态有限、视频序列短、动作控制不精确和缺乏奖励意识等问题，需要开发一个更全面的解决方案。

Method: 提出OmniNWM模型：1）联合生成RGB、语义、度量深度和3D占据的全景视频；2）使用归一化全景Plucker射线图表示编码输入轨迹；3）利用生成的3D占据直接定义基于规则的密集奖励。

Result: 实验表明OmniNWM在视频生成、控制精度和长时程稳定性方面达到最先进性能，并通过占据基础奖励提供了可靠的闭环评估框架。

Conclusion: OmniNWM成功解决了自动驾驶世界模型在状态、动作和奖励三个核心维度的挑战，为自动驾驶系统提供了更全面和可靠的仿真环境。

Abstract: Autonomous driving world models are expected to work effectively across three
core dimensions: state, action, and reward. Existing models, however, are
typically restricted to limited state modalities, short video sequences,
imprecise action control, and a lack of reward awareness. In this paper, we
introduce OmniNWM, an omniscient panoramic navigation world model that
addresses all three dimensions within a unified framework. For state, OmniNWM
jointly generates panoramic videos of RGB, semantics, metric depth, and 3D
occupancy. A flexible forcing strategy enables high-quality long-horizon
auto-regressive generation. For action, we introduce a normalized panoramic
Plucker ray-map representation that encodes input trajectories into pixel-level
signals, enabling highly precise and generalizable control over panoramic video
generation. Regarding reward, we move beyond learning reward functions with
external image-based models: instead, we leverage the generated 3D occupancy to
directly define rule-based dense rewards for driving compliance and safety.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that OmniNWM achieves state-of-the-art
performance in video generation, control accuracy, and long-horizon stability,
while providing a reliable closed-loop evaluation framework through
occupancy-grounded rewards. Project page is available at

Conclusion: 自适应集成方法在提高大型视觉语言模型在高风险应用中的鲁棒性方面具有广阔前景。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have recently achieved impressive
results in multimodal tasks such as image captioning and visual question
answering. However, they remain prone to object hallucination -- generating
descriptions of nonexistent or misidentified objects. Prior work has partially
mitigated this via auxiliary training objectives or external modules, but
challenges remain in terms of scalability, adaptability, and model
independence. To address these limitations, we propose Adaptive Token Ensemble
Decoding (ATED), a training-free, token-level ensemble framework that mitigates
hallucination by aggregating predictions from multiple LVLMs during inference.
ATED dynamically computes uncertainty-based weights for each model, reflecting
their reliability at each decoding step. It also integrates diverse decoding
paths to improve contextual grounding and semantic consistency. Experiments on
standard hallucination detection benchmarks demonstrate that ATED significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art methods, reducing hallucination without
compromising fluency or relevance. Our findings highlight the benefits of
adaptive ensembling and point to a promising direction for improving LVLM
robustness in high-stakes applications. The code is available at

Conclusion: ATTBHFA-Net通过概率分布层面的对比学习，有效解决了灾难图像少样本分类问题，为实际应用提供了可靠解决方案。

Abstract: The increasing frequency of natural and human-induced disasters necessitates
advanced visual recognition techniques capable of analyzing critical
photographic data. With progress in artificial intelligence and resilient
computational systems, rapid and accurate disaster classification has become
crucial for efficient rescue operations. However, visual recognition in
disaster contexts faces significant challenges due to limited and diverse data
from the difficulties in collecting and curating comprehensive, high-quality
disaster imagery. Few-Shot Learning (FSL) provides a promising approach to data
scarcity, yet current FSL research mainly relies on generic benchmark datasets
lacking remote-sensing disaster imagery, limiting its practical effectiveness.
Moreover, disaster images exhibit high intra-class variation and inter-class
similarity, hindering the performance of conventional metric-based FSL methods.
To address these issues, this paper introduces the Attention-based
Bhattacharyya-Hellinger Feature Aggregation Network (ATTBHFA-Net), which
linearly combines the Bhattacharyya coefficient and Hellinger distances to
compare and aggregate feature probability distributions for robust prototype
formation. The Bhattacharyya coefficient serves as a contrastive margin that
enhances inter-class separability, while the Hellinger distance regularizes
same-class alignment. This framework parallels contrastive learning but
operates over probability distributions rather than embedded feature points.
Furthermore, a Bhattacharyya-Hellinger distance-based contrastive loss is
proposed as a distributional counterpart to cosine similarity loss, used
jointly with categorical cross-entropy to significantly improve FSL
performance. Experiments on four FSL benchmarks and two disaster image datasets
demonstrate the superior effectiveness and generalization of ATTBHFA-Net
compared to existing approaches.

Abstract: Realistic view extrapolation is critical for closed-loop simulation in
autonomous driving, yet it remains a significant challenge for current Novel
View Synthesis (NVS) methods, which often produce distorted and inconsistent
images beyond the original trajectory. This report presents our winning
solution which ctook first place in the RealADSim Workshop NVS track at ICCV
2025. To address the core challenges of street view extrapolation, we introduce
a comprehensive four-stage pipeline. First, we employ a data-driven
initialization strategy to generate a robust pseudo-LiDAR point cloud, avoiding
local minima. Second, we inject strong geometric priors by modeling the road
surface with a novel dimension-reduced SDF termed 2D-SDF. Third, we leverage a
generative prior to create pseudo ground truth for extrapolated viewpoints,
providing auxilary supervision. Finally, a data-driven adaptation network
removes time-specific artifacts. On the RealADSim-NVS benchmark, our method
achieves a final score of 0.441, ranking first among all participants.

Conclusion: 优化视觉空间是零样本学习的关键，提出的视觉原型方法能有效提升性能。

Abstract: Zero-shot learning, which aims to recognize new categories that are not
included in the training set, has gained popularity owing to its potential
ability in the real-word applications. Zero-shot learning models rely on
learning an embedding space, where both semantic descriptions of classes and
visual features of instances can be embedded for nearest neighbor search.
Recently, most of the existing works consider the visual space formulated by
deep visual features as an ideal choice of the embedding space. However, the
discrete distribution of instances in the visual space makes the data structure
unremarkable. We argue that optimizing the visual space is crucial as it allows
semantic vectors to be embedded into the visual space more effectively. In this
work, we propose two strategies to accomplish this purpose. One is the visual
prototype based method, which learns a visual prototype for each visual class,
so that, in the visual space, a class can be represented by a prototype feature
instead of a series of discrete visual features. The other is to optimize the
visual feature structure in an intermediate embedding space, and in this method
we successfully devise a multilayer perceptron framework based algorithm that
is able to learn the common intermediate embedding space and meanwhile to make
the visual data structure more distinctive. Through extensive experimental
evaluation on four benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that optimizing visual
space is beneficial for zero-shot learning. Besides, the proposed prototype
based method achieves the new state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Compared to the prosperity of pre-training models in natural image
understanding, the research on large-scale pre-training models for facial
knowledge learning is still limited. Current approaches mainly rely on manually
assembled and annotated face datasets for training, but labeling such datasets
is labor-intensive and the trained models have limited scalability beyond the
training data. To address these limitations, we present a generative
pre-training model for facial knowledge learning that leverages large-scale
web-built data for training. We use texts and images containing human faces
crawled from the internet and conduct pre-training on self-supervised tasks,
including masked image/language modeling (MILM) and image-text matching (ITM).
During the generation stage, we further utilize the image-text matching loss to
pull the generation distribution towards the control signal for controllable
image/text generation. Experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves
comparable performance to state-of-the-art pre-training models for various
facial downstream tasks, such as attribution classification and expression
recognition. Furthermore, our approach is also applicable to a wide range of
face editing tasks, including face attribute editing, expression manipulation,
mask removal, and photo inpainting.

Motivation: 现有方法在时间采样和模态偏好感知方面缺乏足够的灵活性和动态适应性，难以根据问题聚焦关键信息，限制了在复杂场景中的推理能力。

Method: 1) 时间维度：动态自适应焦点采样机制，逐步聚焦与问题最相关的音频-视觉片段；2) 模态维度：偏好感知策略，独立建模各模态贡献，选择性激活关键特征；3) 双路径对比损失，增强跨时间和模态维度的一致性和互补性。

Conclusion: AV-Master通过动态时间和模态建模有效解决了音频-视觉问答中的关键信息提取问题，提升了模型在复杂场景中的推理能力。

Abstract: Audio-Visual Question Answering (AVQA) requires models to effectively utilize
both visual and auditory modalities to answer complex and diverse questions
about audio-visual scenes. However, existing methods lack sufficient
flexibility and dynamic adaptability in temporal sampling and modality
preference awareness, making it difficult to focus on key information based on
the question. This limits their reasoning capability in complex scenarios. To
address these challenges, we propose a novel framework named AV-Master. It
enhances the model's ability to extract key information from complex
audio-visual scenes with substantial redundant content by dynamically modeling
both temporal and modality dimensions. In the temporal dimension, we introduce
a dynamic adaptive focus sampling mechanism that progressively focuses on
audio-visual segments most relevant to the question, effectively mitigating
redundancy and segment fragmentation in traditional sampling methods. In the
modality dimension, we propose a preference-aware strategy that models each
modality's contribution independently, enabling selective activation of
critical features. Furthermore, we introduce a dual-path contrastive loss to
reinforce consistency and complementarity across temporal and modality
dimensions, guiding the model to learn question-specific cross-modal
collaborative representations. Experiments on four large-scale benchmarks show
that AV-Master significantly outperforms existing methods, especially in
complex reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: Diffusion-DRO通过消除对奖励模型的依赖并解决非线性估计问题，有效提升了文本到图像扩散模型与人类偏好的对齐效果。

Abstract: Direct preference optimization (DPO) methods have shown strong potential in
aligning text-to-image diffusion models with human preferences by training on
paired comparisons. These methods improve training stability by avoiding the
REINFORCE algorithm but still struggle with challenges such as accurately
estimating image probabilities due to the non-linear nature of the sigmoid
function and the limited diversity of offline datasets. In this paper, we
introduce Diffusion Denoising Ranking Optimization (Diffusion-DRO), a new
preference learning framework grounded in inverse reinforcement learning.
Diffusion-DRO removes the dependency on a reward model by casting preference
learning as a ranking problem, thereby simplifying the training objective into
a denoising formulation and overcoming the non-linear estimation issues found
in prior methods. Moreover, Diffusion-DRO uniquely integrates offline expert
demonstrations with online policy-generated negative samples, enabling it to
effectively capture human preferences while addressing the limitations of
offline data. Comprehensive experiments show that Diffusion-DRO delivers
improved generation quality across a range of challenging and unseen prompts,
outperforming state-of-the-art baselines in both both quantitative metrics and
user studies. Our source code and pre-trained models are available at

*Jiajun Hong,Jianan Wei,Wenguan Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GroupHOI是一个用于人-物交互检测的框架，通过几何邻近性和语义相似性来传播上下文信息，解决了现有方法忽视群体交互行为的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的人-物交互检测方法主要关注成对关系，但现实场景中的交互往往来自群体行为（多个人和物体参与联合活动）。

Method: 提出GroupHOI框架：1）使用基于边界框空间特征的可学习邻近性估计器将人和物体分组；2）在每个组内通过自注意力计算软对应关系来聚合和分发上下文线索；3）用HO对特征增强基于transformer的交互解码器以融入语义相似性。

Result: 在HICO-DET和V-COCO基准测试中表现出优于现有方法的性能，在更具挑战性的非语言交互检测任务中也表现出领先性能。

Conclusion: GroupHOI通过从群体视角重新审视关系建模，有效处理了现实场景中的高阶交互，在人-物交互检测任务中取得了最先进的性能。

Abstract: Human-Object Interaction Detection (HOI-DET) aims to localize human-object
pairs and identify their interactive relationships. To aggregate contextual
cues, existing methods typically propagate information across all detected
entities via self-attention mechanisms, or establish message passing between
humans and objects with bipartite graphs. However, they primarily focus on
pairwise relationships, overlooking that interactions in real-world scenarios
often emerge from collective behaviors (multiple humans and objects engaging in
joint activities). In light of this, we revisit relation modeling from a group
view and propose GroupHOI, a framework that propagates contextual information
in terms of geometric proximity and semantic similarity. To exploit the
geometric proximity, humans and objects are grouped into distinct clusters
using a learnable proximity estimator based on spatial features derived from
bounding boxes. In each group, a soft correspondence is computed via
self-attention to aggregate and dispatch contextual cues. To incorporate the
semantic similarity, we enhance the vanilla transformer-based interaction
decoder with local contextual cues from HO-pair features. Extensive experiments
on HICO-DET and V-COCO benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of GroupHOI over
the state-of-the-art methods. It also exhibits leading performance on the more
challenging Nonverbal Interaction Detection (NVI-DET) task, which involves
varied forms of higher-order interactions within groups.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出FeatureFool，一种针对视频分类器和Video-LLMs的零查询黑盒攻击方法，通过利用DNN提取的特征信息直接改变干净视频的特征空间，无需多次查询交互。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有黑盒对抗攻击需要多轮模型交互和大量查询，这在现实世界中不实用且难以扩展到新兴的Video-LLMs。视频领域尚无直接利用特征映射来改变干净视频特征空间的攻击方法。

Method: FeatureFool利用从DNN提取的信息直接改变干净视频的特征空间，实现零查询攻击。该方法通过特征映射的可转移性来制作有害内容并绕过Video-LLM识别。

Result: 实验显示FeatureFool对传统视频分类器的攻击成功率超过70%且无需任何查询。生成的对抗视频在SSIM、PSNR和Temporal-Inconsistency指标上质量高，攻击几乎不可察觉。

Conclusion: FeatureFool证明了在视频领域实现高效零查询黑盒攻击的可行性，为视频安全研究提供了新视角。

Abstract: The vulnerability of deep neural networks (DNNs) has been preliminarily
verified. Existing black-box adversarial attacks usually require multi-round
interaction with the model and consume numerous queries, which is impractical
in the real-world and hard to scale to recently emerged Video-LLMs. Moreover,
no attack in the video domain directly leverages feature maps to shift the
clean-video feature space. We therefore propose FeatureFool, a stealthy,
video-domain, zero-query black-box attack that utilizes information extracted
from a DNN to alter the feature space of clean videos. Unlike query-based
methods that rely on iterative interaction, FeatureFool performs a zero-query
attack by directly exploiting DNN-extracted information. This efficient
approach is unprecedented in the video domain. Experiments show that
FeatureFool achieves an attack success rate above 70\% against traditional
video classifiers without any queries. Benefiting from the transferability of
the feature map, it can also craft harmful content and bypass Video-LLM
recognition. Additionally, adversarial videos generated by FeatureFool exhibit
high quality in terms of SSIM, PSNR, and Temporal-Inconsistency, making the
attack barely perceptible. This paper may contain violent or explicit content.

Motivation: 现有ICA方法主要依赖单模态视觉特征，无法充分捕捉与图像复杂度相关的感知表示。跨模态场景语义信息在感知理解任务中很重要，但在ICA中尚未被探索。

Method: CM-SSA包含复杂度回归分支和场景语义对齐分支。回归分支在语义对齐分支的指导下估计复杂度，对齐分支通过成对学习将图像与包含丰富场景语义的文本提示对齐。

Result: 在多个ICA数据集上的广泛实验表明，CM-SSA显著优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: 跨模态场景语义对齐能够有效提升图像复杂度评估性能，使预测更符合人类主观感知。

Abstract: Image complexity assessment (ICA) is a challenging task in perceptual
evaluation due to the subjective nature of human perception and the inherent
semantic diversity in real-world images. Existing ICA methods predominantly
rely on hand-crafted or shallow convolutional neural network-based features of
a single visual modality, which are insufficient to fully capture the perceived
representations closely related to image complexity. Recently, cross-modal
scene semantic information has been shown to play a crucial role in various
computer vision tasks, particularly those involving perceptual understanding.
However, the exploration of cross-modal scene semantic information in the
context of ICA remains unaddressed. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a
novel ICA method called Cross-Modal Scene Semantic Alignment (CM-SSA), which
leverages scene semantic alignment from a cross-modal perspective to enhance
ICA performance, enabling complexity predictions to be more consistent with
subjective human perception. Specifically, the proposed CM-SSA consists of a
complexity regression branch and a scene semantic alignment branch. The
complexity regression branch estimates image complexity levels under the
guidance of the scene semantic alignment branch, while the scene semantic
alignment branch is used to align images with corresponding text prompts that
convey rich scene semantic information by pair-wise learning. Extensive
experiments on several ICA datasets demonstrate that the proposed CM-SSA
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches. Codes are available at

Motivation: 现有对抗性剪枝方法在分数空间优化时容易陷入尖锐局部极小值，导致掩码选择不稳定，降低鲁棒性

Method: 在掩码搜索过程中引入分数空间锐度最小化，通过扰动重要性分数并最小化相应的鲁棒损失

Result: 在多个数据集、模型和稀疏度水平上的实验表明，S2AP能有效最小化分数空间锐度，稳定掩码选择

Conclusion: S2AP方法通过分数空间锐度最小化显著提高了对抗性剪枝方法的鲁棒性

Abstract: Adversarial pruning methods have emerged as a powerful tool for compressing
neural networks while preserving robustness against adversarial attacks. These
methods typically follow a three-step pipeline: (i) pretrain a robust model,
(ii) select a binary mask for weight pruning, and (iii) finetune the pruned
model. To select the binary mask, these methods minimize a robust loss by
assigning an importance score to each weight, and then keep the weights with
the highest scores. However, this score-space optimization can lead to sharp
local minima in the robust loss landscape and, in turn, to an unstable mask
selection, reducing the robustness of adversarial pruning methods. To overcome
this issue, we propose a novel plug-in method for adversarial pruning, termed
Score-space Sharpness-aware Adversarial Pruning (S2AP). Through our method, we
introduce the concept of score-space sharpness minimization, which operates
during the mask search by perturbing importance scores and minimizing the
corresponding robust loss. Extensive experiments across various datasets,
models, and sparsity levels demonstrate that S2AP effectively minimizes
sharpness in score space, stabilizing the mask selection, and ultimately
improving the robustness of adversarial pruning methods.

Abstract: Background and Objective: In brain imaging, geometric surface models are
essential for analyzing the 3D shapes of anatomical structures. Alzheimer's
disease (AD) is associated with significant cortical atrophy, making such shape
analysis a valuable diagnostic tool. The objective of this study is to
introduce and validate a novel local surface representation method for the
automated and accurate diagnosis of AD. Methods: The study utilizes T1-weighted
MRI scans from 160 participants (80 AD patients and 80 healthy controls) from
the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Cortical surface models
were reconstructed from the MRI data using Freesurfer. Key geometric attributes
were computed from the 3D meshes. Area distortion and conformal factor were
derived using Ricci flow for conformal parameterization, while Gaussian
curvature was calculated directly from the mesh geometry. Shannon entropy was
applied to these three features to create compact and informative feature
vectors. The feature vectors were used to train and evaluate a suite of
classifiers (e.g. XGBoost, MLP, Logistic Regression, etc.). Results:
Statistical significance of performance differences between classifiers was
evaluated using paired Welch's t-test. The method proved highly effective in
distinguishing AD patients from healthy controls. The Multi-Layer Perceptron
(MLP) and Logistic Regression classifiers outperformed all others, achieving an
accuracy and F$_1$ Score of 98.62%. Conclusions: This study confirms that the
entropy of conformally-derived geometric features provides a powerful and
robust metric for cortical morphometry. The high classification accuracy
underscores the method's potential to enhance the study and diagnosis of
Alzheimer's disease, offering a straightforward yet powerful tool for clinical
research applications.

Abstract: Tensor decomposition is a powerful tool for data analysis and has been
extensively employed in the field of hyperspectral-multispectral image fusion
(HMF). Existing tensor decomposition-based fusion methods typically rely on
disruptive data vectorization/reshaping or impose rigid constraints on the
arrangement of factor tensors, hindering the preservation of spatial-spectral
structures and the modeling of cross-dimensional correlations. Although recent
advances utilizing the Fully-Connected Tensor Network (FCTN) decomposition have
partially alleviated these limitations, the process of reorganizing data into
higher-order tensors still disrupts the intrinsic spatial-spectral structure.
Furthermore, these methods necessitate extensive manual parameter tuning and
exhibit limited robustness against noise and spatial degradation. To alleviate
these issues, we propose the Bayesian FCTN (BFCTN) method. Within this
probabilistic framework, a hierarchical sparse prior that characterizing the
sparsity of physical elements, establishes connections between the factor
tensors. This framework explicitly models the intrinsic physical coupling among
spatial structures, spectral signatures, and local scene homogeneity. For model
learning, we develop a parameter estimation method based on Variational
Bayesian inference (VB) and the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm, which
significantly reduces the need for manual parameter tuning. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that BFCTN not only achieves state-of-the-art fusion
accuracy and strong robustness but also exhibits practical applicability in
complex real-world scenarios.

Motivation: 解决大型视觉transformer模型训练计算成本高的问题，提供一种经济高效的模型扩展方案。

Method: 在预训练ViT中插入附加层，采用层间权重共享保持参数效率，并通过并行适配器模块引入调整参数来缓解共享权重带来的性能下降。

Result: 在ImageNet-1K数据集上，2倍深度扩展的DeiT-Base模型相比从头训练准确率提升7.42%，且仅需三分之一训练周期。

Conclusion: ScaleNet为ViT模型扩展提供了高效解决方案，在图像分类和下游视觉任务中均表现出良好潜力。

Abstract: Recent advancements in vision transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated that
larger models often achieve superior performance. However, training these
models remains computationally intensive and costly. To address this challenge,
we introduce ScaleNet, an efficient approach for scaling ViT models. Unlike
conventional training from scratch, ScaleNet facilitates rapid model expansion
with negligible increases in parameters, building on existing pretrained
models. This offers a cost-effective solution for scaling up ViTs.
Specifically, ScaleNet achieves model expansion by inserting additional layers
into pretrained ViTs, utilizing layer-wise weight sharing to maintain
parameters efficiency. Each added layer shares its parameter tensor with a
corresponding layer from the pretrained model. To mitigate potential
performance degradation due to shared weights, ScaleNet introduces a small set
of adjustment parameters for each layer. These adjustment parameters are
implemented through parallel adapter modules, ensuring that each instance of
the shared parameter tensor remains distinct and optimized for its specific
function. Experiments on the ImageNet-1K dataset demonstrate that ScaleNet
enables efficient expansion of ViT models. With a 2$\times$ depth-scaled
DeiT-Base model, ScaleNet achieves a 7.42% accuracy improvement over training
from scratch while requiring only one-third of the training epochs,
highlighting its efficiency in scaling ViTs. Beyond image classification, our
method shows significant potential for application in downstream vision areas,
as evidenced by the validation in object detection task.

Method: 提出RISE框架：1) 使用无标注训练图像构建环境和伪装目标的原型库；2) 采用聚类-检索策略生成高质量原型；3) 通过多视图KNN检索生成鲁棒的伪掩码。

Result: 大量实验表明RISE在无监督和基于提示的方法中达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: RISE证明了利用数据集级上下文信息生成伪标签的有效性，为无监督COD提供了新思路。

Abstract: At the core of Camouflaged Object Detection (COD) lies segmenting objects
from their highly similar surroundings. Previous efforts navigate this
challenge primarily through image-level modeling or annotation-based
optimization. Despite advancing considerably, this commonplace practice hardly
taps valuable dataset-level contextual information or relies on laborious
annotations. In this paper, we propose RISE, a RetrIeval SElf-augmented
paradigm that exploits the entire training dataset to generate pseudo-labels
for single images, which could be used to train COD models. RISE begins by
constructing prototype libraries for environments and camouflaged objects using
training images (without ground truth), followed by K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN)
retrieval to generate pseudo-masks for each image based on these libraries. It
is important to recognize that using only training images without annotations
exerts a pronounced challenge in crafting high-quality prototype libraries. In
this light, we introduce a Clustering-then-Retrieval (CR) strategy, where
coarse masks are first generated through clustering, facilitating subsequent
histogram-based image filtering and cross-category retrieval to produce
high-confidence prototypes. In the KNN retrieval stage, to alleviate the effect
of artifacts in feature maps, we propose Multi-View KNN Retrieval (MVKR), which
integrates retrieval results from diverse views to produce more robust and
precise pseudo-masks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RISE outperforms
state-of-the-art unsupervised and prompt-based methods. Code is available at

Abstract: This work introduces a new latent diffusion model to generate high-quality 3D
chest CT scans conditioned on 3D anatomical masks. The method synthesizes
volumetric images of size 256x256x256 at 1 mm isotropic resolution using a
single mid-range GPU, significantly lowering the computational cost compared to
existing approaches. The conditioning masks delineate lung and nodule regions,
enabling precise control over the output anatomical features. Experimental
results demonstrate that conditioning solely on nodule masks leads to
anatomically incorrect outputs, highlighting the importance of incorporating
global lung structure for accurate conditional synthesis. The proposed approach
supports the generation of diverse CT volumes with and without lung nodules of
varying attributes, providing a valuable tool for training AI models or
healthcare professionals.

Motivation: 现有方法通过蒸馏将视觉基础模型集成到潜在扩散模型中，但这种方法会削弱与原始VFM的对齐鲁棒性，导致在分布偏移时语义偏离。

Method: 设计VFM-VAE变分自编码器，采用多尺度潜在融合和渐进分辨率重建块来平衡语义关注和像素级保真度，并提出SE-CKNNA指标分析表示动态。

Conclusion: 直接VFM集成是潜在扩散模型的更优范式，在性能和效率上都超越了蒸馏方法。

Abstract: The performance of Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) is critically dependent on
the quality of their visual tokenizer. While recent works have explored
incorporating Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) via distillation, we identify a
fundamental flaw in this approach: it inevitably weakens the robustness of
alignment with the original VFM, causing the aligned latents to deviate
semantically under distribution shifts. In this paper, we bypass distillation
by proposing a more direct approach: Vision Foundation Model Variational
Autoencoder (VFM-VAE). To resolve the inherent tension between the VFM's
semantic focus and the need for pixel-level fidelity, we redesign the VFM-VAE
decoder with Multi-Scale Latent Fusion and Progressive Resolution
Reconstruction blocks, enabling high-quality reconstruction from spatially
coarse VFM features. Furthermore, we provide a comprehensive analysis of
representation dynamics during diffusion training, introducing the proposed
SE-CKNNA metric as a more precise tool for this diagnosis. This analysis allows
us to develop a joint tokenizer-diffusion alignment strategy that dramatically
accelerates convergence. Our innovations in tokenizer design and training
strategy lead to superior performance and efficiency: our system reaches a gFID
(w/o CFG) of 2.20 in merely 80 epochs (a 10x speedup over prior tokenizers).
With continued training to 640 epochs, it further attains a gFID (w/o CFG) of
1.62, establishing direct VFM integration as a superior paradigm for LDMs.

Conclusion: Mono4DGS-HDR成功实现了从无位姿单目LDR视频到可渲染4D HDR场景的高质量重建，在质量和效率方面均表现出色。

Abstract: We introduce Mono4DGS-HDR, the first system for reconstructing renderable 4D
high dynamic range (HDR) scenes from unposed monocular low dynamic range (LDR)
videos captured with alternating exposures. To tackle such a challenging
problem, we present a unified framework with two-stage optimization approach
based on Gaussian Splatting. The first stage learns a video HDR Gaussian
representation in orthographic camera coordinate space, eliminating the need
for camera poses and enabling robust initial HDR video reconstruction. The
second stage transforms video Gaussians into world space and jointly refines
the world Gaussians with camera poses. Furthermore, we propose a temporal
luminance regularization strategy to enhance the temporal consistency of the
HDR appearance. Since our task has not been studied before, we construct a new
evaluation benchmark using publicly available datasets for HDR video
reconstruction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Mono4DGS-HDR
significantly outperforms alternative solutions adapted from state-of-the-art
methods in both rendering quality and speed.

Conclusion: 该方法避免了大规模重训练，通过添加新车型的文本描述即可快速更新，为智慧城市应用中的可扩展车辆识别提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Vehicle make and model recognition (VMMR) is an important task in intelligent
transportation systems, but existing approaches struggle to adapt to newly
released models. Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) provides strong
visual-text alignment, yet its fixed pretrained weights limit performance
without costly image-specific finetuning. We propose a pipeline that integrates
vision language models (VLMs) with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to
support zero-shot recognition through text-based reasoning. A VLM converts
vehicle images into descriptive attributes, which are compared against a
database of textual features. Relevant entries are retrieved and combined with
the description to form a prompt, and a language model (LM) infers the make and
model. This design avoids large-scale retraining and enables rapid updates by
adding textual descriptions of new vehicles. Experiments show that the proposed
method improves recognition by nearly 20% over the CLIP baseline, demonstrating
the potential of RAG-enhanced LM reasoning for scalable VMMR in smart-city
applications.

*Suman Kunwar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 开发了DWaste平台，利用计算机视觉在资源受限设备上实现实时垃圾分类，比较了多种模型在准确率、延迟和碳排放方面的表现，发现轻量级目标检测模型更适合实时低功耗应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 便利包装的普及导致大量垃圾产生，需要高效的垃圾分类系统来支持可持续废物管理。

Method: 开发DWaste平台，测试多种图像分类模型（EfficientNetV2S/M、ResNet50/101、MobileNet）和目标检测模型（YOLOv8n、YOLOv11n），使用自定义标注工具Annotated Lab处理垃圾数据集，并进行模型量化优化。

Result: EfficientNetV2S分类器准确率最高（约96%），但延迟高（0.22s）且碳排放高；轻量级目标检测模型性能良好（最高77% mAP），推理速度快（0.03s），模型尺寸小（<7MB）；模型量化可减少75%的模型大小和VRAM使用。

Conclusion: 成功实现了"绿色AI"模型，支持在边缘设备上进行实时、可持续的垃圾分类，轻量级目标检测模型在准确率和效率之间取得了良好平衡。

Abstract: The rise of convenience packaging has led to generation of enormous waste,
making efficient waste sorting crucial for sustainable waste management. To
address this, we developed DWaste, a computer vision-powered platform designed
for real-time waste sorting on resource-constrained smartphones and edge
devices, including offline functionality. We benchmarked various image
classification models (EfficientNetV2S/M, ResNet50/101, MobileNet) and object
detection (YOLOv8n, YOLOv11n) using a subset of our own waste data set and
annotated it using the custom tool Annotated Lab. We found a clear trade-off
between accuracy and resource consumption: the best classifier,
EfficientNetV2S, achieved high accuracy (~ 96%) but suffered from high latency
(~ 0.22s) and elevated carbon emissions. In contrast, lightweight object
detection models delivered strong performance (up to 77% mAP) with ultra-fast
inference (~ 0.03s) and significantly smaller model sizes (< 7MB), making them
ideal for real-time, low-power use. Model quantization further maximized
efficiency, substantially reducing model size and VRAM usage by up to 75%. Our
work demonstrates the successful implementation of "Greener AI" models to
support real-time, sustainable waste sorting on edge devices.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的基于模板的物体姿态估计方法，将其重新表述为光线对齐问题，使用扩散变换器架构来对齐查询图像与带姿态的模板图像。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于模板的姿态估计方法在检索错误模板时会导致不准确的姿态预测，需要解决模板检索失败的问题。

Method: 将物体姿态估计重新表述为光线对齐问题，使用扩散变换器架构，重新参数化物体旋转为物体中心相机光线，并扩展尺度不变平移估计为密集平移偏移。采用基于窄化模板采样的由粗到精训练策略。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法在未见物体姿态估计方面与最先进方法相比具有竞争力。

Conclusion: 通过将姿态估计重新表述为光线对齐问题并利用扩散变换器架构，能够有效利用模板的几何先验来指导准确的查询姿态推断。

Abstract: Typical template-based object pose pipelines estimate the pose by retrieving
the closest matching template and aligning it with the observed image. However,
failure to retrieve the correct template often leads to inaccurate pose
predictions. To address this, we reformulate template-based object pose
estimation as a ray alignment problem, where the viewing directions from
multiple posed template images are learned to align with a non-posed query
image. Inspired by recent progress in diffusion-based camera pose estimation,
we embed this formulation into a diffusion transformer architecture that aligns
a query image with a set of posed templates. We reparameterize object rotation
using object-centered camera rays and model object translation by extending
scale-invariant translation estimation to dense translation offsets. Our model
leverages geometric priors from the templates to guide accurate query pose
inference. A coarse-to-fine training strategy based on narrowed template
sampling improves performance without modifying the network architecture.
Extensive experiments across multiple benchmark datasets show competitive
results of our method compared to state-of-the-art approaches in unseen object
pose estimation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LiDAR 3D检测器使用全局特征（绝对笛卡尔坐标）时会产生几何捷径问题，导致模型过度依赖绝对位置而非物体形状特征，限制了在不同传感器配置下的泛化能力。

Method: 使用GBlobs局部点云特征描述符作为网络输入特征，避免几何捷径，迫使网络学习鲁棒的、以物体为中心的表示。

Result: 该方法显著提升了模型在不同传感器配置下的泛化能力，在挑战赛中表现出卓越性能。

Conclusion: GBlobs特征描述符能有效解决LiDAR 3D检测中的几何捷径问题，提升模型在不同传感器配置下的泛化性能。

Abstract: This technical report outlines the top-ranking solution for RoboSense 2025:
Track 3, achieving state-of-the-art performance on 3D object detection under
various sensor placements. Our submission utilizes GBlobs, a local point cloud
feature descriptor specifically designed to enhance model generalization across
diverse LiDAR configurations. Current LiDAR-based 3D detectors often suffer
from a \enquote{geometric shortcut} when trained on conventional global
features (\ie, absolute Cartesian coordinates). This introduces a position bias
that causes models to primarily rely on absolute object position rather than
distinguishing shape and appearance characteristics. Although effective for
in-domain data, this shortcut severely limits generalization when encountering
different point distributions, such as those resulting from varying sensor
placements. By using GBlobs as network input features, we effectively
circumvent this geometric shortcut, compelling the network to learn robust,
object-centric representations. This approach significantly enhances the
model's ability to generalize, resulting in the exceptional performance
demonstrated in this challenge.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动驾驶数据集虽然包含传感器噪声和环境变化，但缺乏可控、参数化和可重复的多模态传感器退化数据，限制了系统评估感知和融合架构在明确不利条件下的性能。

Method: 扩展nuScenes数据集：为相机模态提供完整版和迷你版，包含四种遮挡类型；为雷达和LiDAR提供参数化遮挡脚本，每种实现三种退化类型，支持灵活可重复的遮挡数据生成。

Result: 创建了首个具有可控和可重复退化的多传感器遮挡数据集，支持在部分传感器故障和环境干扰下对感知模型进行一致、可重复的评估。

Conclusion: 该数据集旨在推动自动驾驶中鲁棒传感器融合、弹性分析和安全关键感知的研究进展。

Abstract: Robust perception in automated driving requires reliable performance under
adverse conditions, where sensors may be affected by partial failures or
environmental occlusions. Although existing autonomous driving datasets
inherently contain sensor noise and environmental variability, very few enable
controlled, parameterised, and reproducible degradations across multiple
sensing modalities. This gap limits the ability to systematically evaluate how
perception and fusion architectures perform under well-defined adverse
conditions. To address this limitation, we introduce the Occluded nuScenes
Dataset, a novel extension of the widely used nuScenes benchmark. For the
camera modality, we release both the full and mini versions with four types of
occlusions, two adapted from public implementations and two newly designed. For
radar and LiDAR, we provide parameterised occlusion scripts that implement
three types of degradations each, enabling flexible and repeatable generation
of occluded data. This resource supports consistent, reproducible evaluation of
perception models under partial sensor failures and environmental interference.
By releasing the first multi-sensor occlusion dataset with controlled and
reproducible degradations, we aim to advance research on robust sensor fusion,
resilience analysis, and safety-critical perception in automated driving.

TL;DR: Kaleido是一个主题到视频生成框架，通过专用数据构建流程和参考旋转位置编码，解决了多主题一致性和背景解耦问题，显著提升了视频生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有主题到视频生成方法在多主题一致性和背景解耦方面存在不足，导致参考保真度低和语义漂移问题，主要原因是训练数据缺乏多样性和多图像整合机制不理想。

Method: 提出了专用数据构建流程（包含低质量样本过滤和多样化数据合成）和参考旋转位置编码（R-RoPE），用于稳定精确地整合多参考图像。

Result: 在多个基准测试上的广泛实验表明，Kaleido在一致性、保真度和泛化能力方面显著优于先前方法。

Conclusion: Kaleido代表了主题到视频生成领域的进步，通过改进的数据构建和参考图像处理机制，有效解决了多主题一致性问题。

Abstract: We present Kaleido, a subject-to-video~(S2V) generation framework, which aims
to synthesize subject-consistent videos conditioned on multiple reference
images of target subjects. Despite recent progress in S2V generation models,
existing approaches remain inadequate at maintaining multi-subject consistency
and at handling background disentanglement, often resulting in lower reference
fidelity and semantic drift under multi-image conditioning. These shortcomings
can be attributed to several factors. Primarily, the training dataset suffers
from a lack of diversity and high-quality samples, as well as cross-paired
data, i.e., paired samples whose components originate from different instances.
In addition, the current mechanism for integrating multiple reference images is
suboptimal, potentially resulting in the confusion of multiple subjects. To
overcome these limitations, we propose a dedicated data construction pipeline,
incorporating low-quality sample filtering and diverse data synthesis, to
produce consistency-preserving training data. Moreover, we introduce Reference
Rotary Positional Encoding (R-RoPE) to process reference images, enabling
stable and precise multi-image integration. Extensive experiments across
numerous benchmarks demonstrate that Kaleido significantly outperforms previous
methods in consistency, fidelity, and generalization, marking an advance in S2V
generation.

TL;DR: CovMatch是一个可扩展的多模态数据集蒸馏框架，通过对齐真实和合成特征的跨协方差并正则化各模态内的特征分布，实现了双编码器的联合优化，在仅使用500对合成样本的情况下在Flickr30K和COCO上取得了最先进的检索性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态数据集蒸馏面临两个关键挑战：学习跨模态对齐和管理大型编码器的高计算成本。现有方法通过冻结文本编码器来应对可扩展性问题，但这严重限制了语义对齐能力，成为性能扩展的瓶颈。

Method: 提出CovMatch框架，通过对齐真实和合成特征的跨协方差来学习跨模态对齐，同时对每个模态内的特征分布进行正则化。与先前方法不同，CovMatch能够联合优化图像和文本编码器。

Result: 在Flickr30K和COCO数据集上的评估表明，CovMatch优于现有的多模态蒸馏方法，仅使用500对合成样本就实现了检索准确率6.8%的绝对提升。

Conclusion: CovMatch通过跨协方差对齐和特征分布正则化，解决了多模态数据集蒸馏中的跨模态对齐挑战，实现了更好的性能扩展和更强的语义对齐能力。

Abstract: Multimodal dataset distillation aims to synthesize a small set of image-text
pairs that enables efficient training of large-scale vision-language models.
While dataset distillation has shown promise in unimodal tasks, extending it to
multimodal contrastive learning presents key challenges: learning cross-modal
alignment and managing the high computational cost of large encoders. Prior
approaches address scalability by freezing the text encoder and update only the
image encoder and text projection layer. However, we find this severely limits
semantic alignment and becomes a bottleneck for performance scaling. We propose
CovMatch, a scalable dataset distillation framework that aligns the
cross-covariance of real and synthetic features while regularizing feature
distributions within each modality. Unlike prior approaches, CovMatch enables
joint optimization of both encoders, leading to stronger cross-modal alignment
and improved performance. Evaluated on Flickr30K and COCO, CovMatch outperforms
state-of-the-art multimodal distillation methods and achieves up to 6.8%
absolute gains in retrieval accuracy using only 500 synthetic pairs.

Motivation: 现有的视觉语言模型在理解3D空间关系方面存在局限，主要依赖纯文本或2D视觉线索，无法满足需要3D空间想象的任务需求。

Method: 采用两阶段训练：首先通过监督训练将VLM生成的3D潜在表示与3D基础模型对齐，然后基于结果信号优化整个推理轨迹以改进3D心理建模。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，3DThinker始终优于强基线方法，为将3D表示统一到多模态推理提供了新视角。

Conclusion: 3DThinker框架成功实现了无需3D先验输入的3D心理建模，为多模态推理中的3D空间理解开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Though recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have achieved
remarkable progress across a wide range of multimodal tasks, understanding 3D
spatial relationships from limited views remains a significant challenge.
Previous reasoning methods typically rely on pure text (e.g., topological
cognitive maps) or on 2D visual cues. However, their limited representational
capacity hinders performance in specific tasks that require 3D spatial
imagination. To address this limitation, we propose 3DThinker, a framework that
can effectively exploits the rich geometric information embedded within images
while reasoning, like humans do. Our framework is the first to enable 3D
mentaling during reasoning without any 3D prior input, and it does not rely on
explicitly labeled 3D data for training. Specifically, our training consists of
two stages. First, we perform supervised training to align the 3D latent
generated by VLM while reasoning with that of a 3D foundation model (e.g.,
VGGT). Then, we optimize the entire reasoning trajectory solely based on
outcome signals, thereby refining the underlying 3D mentaling. Extensive
experiments across multiple benchmarks show that 3DThinker consistently
outperforms strong baselines and offers a new perspective toward unifying 3D
representations into multimodal reasoning. Our code will be available at

Motivation: 解决结构化剪枝在一次性设置中性能下降严重的问题，传统方法需要迭代重训练且计算成本高，而现有一次性剪枝方法往往导致显著性能损失。

Method: 采用因果感知剪枝方法，利用模型预测与结构之间的因果关系进行渐进式剪枝，确保被移除的结构不会损害模型性能。

Result: 在卷积神经网络和视觉变换器基准测试中，该方法实现了显著的模型尺寸减少，对性能影响最小，且无需微调。

Conclusion: 该方法优于现有方法，提供了最佳的性能与压缩比权衡，代码已在GitHub上开源。

Abstract: Neural network compression has gained increasing attention in recent years,
particularly in computer vision applications, where the need for model
reduction is crucial for overcoming deployment constraints. Pruning is a widely
used technique that prompts sparsity in model structures, e.g. weights,
neurons, and layers, reducing size and inference costs. Structured pruning is
especially important as it allows for the removal of entire structures, which
further accelerates inference time and reduces memory overhead. However, it can
be computationally expensive, requiring iterative retraining and optimization.
To overcome this problem, recent methods considered one-shot setting, which
applies pruning directly at post-training. Unfortunately, they often lead to a
considerable drop in performance. In this paper, we focus on this issue by
proposing a novel one-shot pruning framework that relies on explainable deep
learning. First, we introduce a causal-aware pruning approach that leverages
cause-effect relations between model predictions and structures in a
progressive pruning process. It allows us to efficiently reduce the size of the
network, ensuring that the removed structures do not deter the performance of
the model. Then, through experiments conducted on convolution neural network
and vision transformer baselines, pre-trained on classification tasks, we
demonstrate that our method consistently achieves substantial reductions in
model size, with minimal impact on performance, and without the need for
fine-tuning. Overall, our approach outperforms its counterparts, offering the
best trade-off. Our code is available on GitHub.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电子显微镜生物图像语义分割在生命科学中具有挑战性，数据复杂度高，即使人类观察者也难以处理。需要开发能在极稀疏标签下有效学习的方法。

Method: 使用分层变分自编码器，结合中心区域掩码、稀疏标签对比学习、高斯混合模型先验和无聚类标签预测。中心区域掩码和修复损失鼓励学习鲁棒嵌入，对比学习和高斯混合模型先验塑造潜在空间，MLP分割头直接预测类别标签。

Conclusion: ε-Seg方法能够在极稀疏标签条件下实现生物图像的有效语义分割，为解决复杂生物图像分析问题提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation of electron microscopy (EM) images of biological
samples remains a challenge in the life sciences. EM data captures details of
biological structures, sometimes with such complexity that even human observers
can find it overwhelming. We introduce {\epsilon}-Seg, a method based on
hierarchical variational autoencoders (HVAEs), employing center-region masking,
sparse label contrastive learning (CL), a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) prior,
and clustering-free label prediction. Center-region masking and the inpainting
loss encourage the model to learn robust and representative embeddings to
distinguish the desired classes, even if training labels are sparse (0.05% of
the total image data or less). For optimal performance, we employ CL and a GMM
prior to shape the latent space of the HVAE such that encoded input patches
tend to cluster wrt. the semantic classes we wish to distinguish. Finally,
instead of clustering latent embeddings for semantic segmentation, we propose a
MLP semantic segmentation head to directly predict class labels from latent
embeddings. We show empirical results of {\epsilon}-Seg and baseline methods on
2 dense EM datasets of biological tissues and demonstrate the applicability of
our method also on fluorescence microscopy data. Our results show that
{\epsilon}-Seg is capable of achieving competitive sparsely-supervised
segmentation results on complex biological image data, even if only limited
amounts of training labels are available.

Conclusion: 提出的基于主动学习和可逆网络的交互式变化检测框架能够有效减少标注需求，同时显著提升变化检测性能，为卫星图像分析提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: This paper devises a novel interactive satellite image change detection
algorithm based on active learning. Our framework employs an iterative process
that leverages a question-and-answer model. This model queries the oracle
(user) about the labels of a small subset of images (dubbed as display), and
based on the oracle's responses, change detection model is dynamically updated.
The main contribution of our framework resides in a novel invertible network
that allows augmenting displays, by mapping them from highly nonlinear input
spaces to latent ones, where augmentation transformations become linear and
more tractable. The resulting augmented data are afterwards mapped back to the
input space, and used to retrain more effective change detection criteria in
the subsequent iterations of active learning. Experimental results demonstrate
superior performance of our proposed method compared to the related work.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 历史笔迹识别面临笔迹风格多样、文档退化、标注样本有限等挑战，传统方法依赖手工特征提取，而端到端方法旨在直接从文档图像学习特征，但在真实场景下泛化能力不足。

Method: 探索了不同的预处理方法、骨干架构和后处理策略组合，包括文本分割、补丁采样和特征聚合等技术。

Result: 大多数配置由于低层视觉特征捕获弱、补丁表示不一致和对内容噪声敏感而表现不佳，但发现一种端到端设置能达到与最佳系统相当的结果。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了构建鲁棒端到端系统的关键挑战，并为改进历史文档笔迹识别性能的设计选择提供了见解。

Abstract: This paper investigates various factors that influence the performance of
end-to-end deep learning approaches for historical writer identification (HWI),
a task that remains challenging due to the diversity of handwriting styles,
document degradation, and the limited number of labelled samples per writer.
These conditions often make accurate recognition difficult, even for human
experts. Traditional HWI methods typically rely on handcrafted image processing
and clustering techniques, which tend to perform well on small and carefully
curated datasets. In contrast, end-to-end pipelines aim to automate the process
by learning features directly from document images. However, our experiments
show that many of these models struggle to generalise in more realistic,
document-level settings, especially under zero-shot scenarios where writers in
the test set are not present in the training data. We explore different
combinations of pre-processing methods, backbone architectures, and
post-processing strategies, including text segmentation, patch sampling, and
feature aggregation. The results suggest that most configurations perform
poorly due to weak capture of low-level visual features, inconsistent patch
representations, and high sensitivity to content noise. Still, we identify one
end-to-end setup that achieves results comparable to the top-performing system,
despite using a simpler design. These findings point to key challenges in
building robust end-to-end systems and offer insight into design choices that
improve performance in historical document writer identification.

Conclusion: MoGA通过语义感知的精确token路由，有效解决了长视频生成中的注意力计算瓶颈，实现了高效的长序列处理能力。

Abstract: Long video generation with Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) is bottlenecked by
the quadratic scaling of full attention with sequence length. Since attention
is highly redundant, outputs are dominated by a small subset of query-key
pairs. Existing sparse methods rely on blockwise coarse estimation, whose
accuracy-efficiency trade-offs are constrained by block size. This paper
introduces Mixture-of-Groups Attention (MoGA), an efficient sparse attention
that uses a lightweight, learnable token router to precisely match tokens
without blockwise estimation. Through semantic-aware routing, MoGA enables
effective long-range interactions. As a kernel-free method, MoGA integrates
seamlessly with modern attention stacks, including FlashAttention and sequence
parallelism. Building on MoGA, we develop an efficient long video generation
model that end-to-end produces minute-level, multi-shot, 480p videos at 24 fps,
with a context length of approximately 580k. Comprehensive experiments on
various video generation tasks validate the effectiveness of our approach.

Conclusion: UniGenBench++解决了现有基准的局限性，提供了更全面、细粒度的T2I生成语义评估能力，促进了社区使用和模型评估。

Abstract: Recent progress in text-to-image (T2I) generation underscores the importance
of reliable benchmarks in evaluating how accurately generated images reflect
the semantics of their textual prompt. However, (1) existing benchmarks lack
the diversity of prompt scenarios and multilingual support, both essential for
real-world applicability; (2) they offer only coarse evaluations across primary
dimensions, covering a narrow range of sub-dimensions, and fall short in
fine-grained sub-dimension assessment. To address these limitations, we
introduce UniGenBench++, a unified semantic assessment benchmark for T2I
generation. Specifically, it comprises 600 prompts organized hierarchically to
ensure both coverage and efficiency: (1) spans across diverse real-world
scenarios, i.e., 5 main prompt themes and 20 subthemes; (2) comprehensively
probes T2I models' semantic consistency over 10 primary and 27 sub evaluation
criteria, with each prompt assessing multiple testpoints. To rigorously assess
model robustness to variations in language and prompt length, we provide both

the general world knowledge and fine-grained image understanding capabilities
of a closed-source Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM), i.e.,

construction and streamlined model assessment. Moreover, to further facilitate
community use, we train a robust evaluation model that enables offline
assessment of T2I model outputs. Through comprehensive benchmarking of both
open- and closed-sourced T2I models, we systematically reveal their strengths
and weaknesses across various aspects.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VC2L是一个统一的视觉中心对比学习框架，通过将文本、图像及其组合都渲染为图像，在像素空间中处理多模态数据，无需OCR、文本标记化或模态融合策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有对比视觉语言模型在处理复杂网页文档时的局限性，特别是当文本和图像交错、松散对齐或以视觉形式嵌入时的挑战。

Method: 使用单一视觉变换器在像素空间中建模所有输入，采用片段级对比学习目标来对齐连续多模态片段，利用文档的内在连贯性而不需要显式配对的图像-文本数据。

Result: 在提出的三个检索基准（AnyCIR、SeqCIR、CSR）和现有数据集（M-BEIR、MTEB）上，VC2L实现了与CLIP风格模型相当或更优的性能。

Conclusion: 多模态网页数据是对比学习的有价值训练资源，统一的视觉中心方法在多模态表示学习中具有可扩展性。

Abstract: Contrastive vision-language models such as CLIP have demonstrated strong
performance across a wide range of multimodal tasks by learning from aligned
image-text pairs. However, their ability to handle complex, real-world web
documents remains limited, particularly in scenarios where text and images are
interleaved, loosely aligned, or embedded in visual form. To address these
challenges, we propose Vision-Centric Contrastive Learning (VC2L), a unified
framework that models text, images, and their combinations using a single
vision transformer. VC2L operates entirely in pixel space by rendering all
inputs, whether textual, visual, or combined, as images, thus eliminating the
need for OCR, text tokenization, or modality fusion strategy. To capture
complex cross-modal relationships in multimodal web documents, VC2L employs a
snippet-level contrastive learning objective that aligns consecutive multimodal
segments, leveraging the inherent coherence of documents without requiring
explicitly paired image-text data. To assess the effectiveness of this
approach, we introduce three retrieval benchmarks, AnyCIR, SeqCIR, and CSR,
designed to evaluate cross-modal retrieval, fine-grained sequential
understanding, and generalization to unseen data, respectively. Empirical
results show that VC2L achieves competitive or superior performance compared to
CLIP-style models on both the proposed benchmarks and established datasets such
as M-BEIR and MTEB. These findings underscore the potential of multimodal web
data as a valuable training resource for contrastive learning and illustrate
the scalability of a unified, vision-centric approach for multimodal
representation learning. Code and models are available at:

TL;DR: SeeTok是一种视觉中心化的文本处理方法，将文本渲染为图像，利用预训练多模态大语言模型的OCR和文本-视觉对齐能力来理解文本，相比传统子词分词方法显著减少计算量并提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LLMs依赖子词分词方法，在处理低资源语言时会产生过分割问题，导致计算效率低下。而人类阅读是基于视觉对象识别，能够有效处理拼写错误、字体变形等问题。

Method: 将文本渲染为图像，利用预训练的多模态大语言模型（如具备OCR和文本-视觉对齐能力的模型）来解读这些视觉文本。

Result: 在三个语言任务中，SeeTok性能达到或超过子词分词器，同时减少4.43倍token数量和70.5%的FLOPs计算量，在跨语言泛化、抗噪能力和语言层次结构方面表现更优。

Conclusion: SeeTok标志着从符号化分词向类人视觉阅读的转变，为构建更自然、认知启发的语言模型迈出了重要一步。

Abstract: People see text. Humans read by recognizing words as visual objects,
including their shapes, layouts, and patterns, before connecting them to
meaning, which enables us to handle typos, distorted fonts, and various scripts
effectively. Modern large language models (LLMs), however, rely on subword
tokenization, fragmenting text into pieces from a fixed vocabulary. While
effective for high-resource languages, this approach over-segments low-resource
languages, yielding long, linguistically meaningless sequences and inflating
computation. In this work, we challenge this entrenched paradigm and move
toward a vision-centric alternative. Our method, SeeTok, renders text as images
(visual-text) and leverages pretrained multimodal LLMs to interpret them,
reusing strong OCR and text-vision alignment abilities learned from large-scale
multimodal training. Across three different language tasks, SeeTok matches or
surpasses subword tokenizers while requiring 4.43 times fewer tokens and
reducing FLOPs by 70.5%, with additional gains in cross-lingual generalization,
robustness to typographic noise, and linguistic hierarchy. SeeTok signals a
shift from symbolic tokenization to human-like visual reading, and takes a step
toward more natural and cognitively inspired language models.

TL;DR: 提出EMIM模块，将传统动作识别中的cost volume思想融入transformer，通过构建类似cost volume的亲和矩阵来增强运动建模能力，在运动敏感数据集上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于transformer的动作识别方法在场景相关数据集上表现良好，但在运动敏感数据集上表现不佳，因为缺乏精细的运动建模设计。传统动作识别中广泛使用的cost volume具有强大的运动建模能力。

Method: 提出EMIM模块，以cost volume方式构建亲和矩阵，从下一帧的查询邻域滑动窗口采样关键候选token，用该矩阵进行上下文聚合和运动特征提取。

Result: 在四个广泛使用的数据集上验证了方法的运动建模能力，特别是在运动敏感数据集Something-Something V1 & V2上优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: 将cost volume的运动建模特性以统一简洁的方式集成到transformer中是有效的，显著提升了在运动敏感数据集上的性能。

Abstract: Recently, action recognition has been dominated by transformer-based methods,
thanks to their spatiotemporal contextual aggregation capacities. However,
despite the significant progress achieved on scene-related datasets, they do
not perform well on motion-sensitive datasets due to the lack of elaborate
motion modeling designs. Meanwhile, we observe that the widely-used cost volume
in traditional action recognition is highly similar to the affinity matrix
defined in self-attention, but equipped with powerful motion modeling
capacities. In light of this, we propose to integrate those effective motion
modeling properties into the existing transformer in a unified and neat way,
with the proposal of the Explicit Motion Information Mining module (EMIM). In
EMIM, we propose to construct the desirable affinity matrix in a cost volume
style, where the set of key candidate tokens is sampled from the query-based
neighboring area in the next frame in a sliding-window manner. Then, the
constructed affinity matrix is used to aggregate contextual information for
appearance modeling and is converted into motion features for motion modeling
as well. We validate the motion modeling capacities of our method on four
widely-used datasets, and our method performs better than existing
state-of-the-art approaches, especially on motion-sensitive datasets, i.e.,
Something-Something V1 & V2.

Motivation: 利用室内场景固有的几何规律性，通过紧凑的平面3D基元表示来重建度量3D结构，避免对3D平面标注的依赖。

Method: 使用Vision Transformers提取稀疏平面基元，估计相对相机位姿，通过平面溅射监督几何学习，梯度通过高分辨率渲染的深度和法线图传播。

Result: 在多个室内场景数据集上验证了度量重建性能，展现出对域外室内环境的强泛化能力，在3D表面重建、深度估计和相对位姿估计等任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: PLANA3R通过平面3D表示实现了准确的平面分割能力，为室内场景的度量3D重建提供了一种无需平面标注的有效解决方案。

Abstract: This paper addresses metric 3D reconstruction of indoor scenes by exploiting
their inherent geometric regularities with compact representations. Using
planar 3D primitives - a well-suited representation for man-made environments -
we introduce PLANA3R, a pose-free framework for metric Planar 3D Reconstruction
from unposed two-view images. Our approach employs Vision Transformers to
extract a set of sparse planar primitives, estimate relative camera poses, and
supervise geometry learning via planar splatting, where gradients are
propagated through high-resolution rendered depth and normal maps of
primitives. Unlike prior feedforward methods that require 3D plane annotations
during training, PLANA3R learns planar 3D structures without explicit plane
supervision, enabling scalable training on large-scale stereo datasets using
only depth and normal annotations. We validate PLANA3R on multiple indoor-scene
datasets with metric supervision and demonstrate strong generalization to
out-of-domain indoor environments across diverse tasks under metric evaluation
protocols, including 3D surface reconstruction, depth estimation, and relative
pose estimation. Furthermore, by formulating with planar 3D representation, our
method emerges with the ability for accurate plane segmentation. The project

TL;DR: GAR是一个区域级多模态大语言模型，通过RoI对齐特征重放技术，能够利用全局上下文进行精确感知，建模多提示间的交互，并实现高级组合推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态大语言模型在复杂场景的细粒度分析方面存在困难，区域级模型虽然有所改进，但往往孤立理解给定区域，忽略了关键的全局上下文。

Method: 引入Grasp Any Region (GAR)模型，采用有效的RoI对齐特征重放技术，支持利用全局上下文进行精确感知，并建模多提示间的交互关系。

Result: GAR-1B在DLC-Bench上超越DAM-3B +4.5分，在GAR-Bench-VQA上甚至超过InternVL3-78B。零样本GAR-8B在VideoRefer-BenchQ上超越领域内VideoRefer-7B。

Conclusion: GAR通过结合全局上下文和多提示交互，实现了先进的区域级视觉理解能力，其强大能力可以轻松迁移到视频领域。

Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel at holistic
understanding, they struggle in capturing the dense world with complex scenes,
requiring fine-grained analysis of intricate details and object
inter-relationships. Region-level MLLMs have been a promising step. However,
previous attempts are generally optimized to understand given regions in
isolation, neglecting crucial global contexts. To address this, we introduce
Grasp Any Region (GAR) for comprehen- sive region-level visual understanding.
Empowered by an effective RoI-aligned feature replay technique, GAR supports
(1) precise perception by leveraging necessary global contexts, and (2)
modeling interactions between multiple prompts. Together, it then naturally
achieves (3) advanced compositional reasoning to answer specific free-form
questions about any region, shifting the paradigm from passive description to
active dialogue. Moreover, we construct GAR-Bench, which not only provides a
more accurate evaluation of single-region comprehension, but also, more
importantly, measures interactions and complex reasoning across multiple
regions. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that GAR-1B not only maintains
the state-of-the-art captioning capabilities, e.g., outperforming DAM-3B +4.5
on DLC-Bench, but also excels at modeling relationships between multiple
prompts with advanced comprehension capabilities, even surpassing InternVL3-78B
on GAR-Bench-VQA. More importantly, our zero-shot GAR-8B even outperforms
in-domain VideoRefer-7B on VideoRefer-BenchQ, indicating its strong
capabilities can be easily transferred to videos.

*Siyong Jian,Huan Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种针对自回归图像生成模型的KV缓存压缩框架，通过识别空间局部性和语义汇聚现象，将注意力头分为两类分别压缩，实现5倍内存减少和6.6倍吞吐量提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归图像生成模型如Janus-Pro虽然能生成高质量图像，但由于大量视觉token导致内存和计算需求巨大。语言模型中的KV缓存压缩技术尚未在图像生成领域得到充分探索。

Method: 识别出空间局部性和语义汇聚现象，将注意力头分为两类：对空间局部性头维护短近期token窗口，对语义汇聚头策略性保留高度关注token的紧凑集合。

Result: 实现了5倍内存使用减少和6.6倍整体吞吐量加速，仅带来最小的视觉质量损失。

Conclusion: 该方法能够在资源受限的硬件上实现高效的原生自回归图像生成。

Abstract: Autoregressive image generation models like Janus-Pro produce high-quality
images, but at the significant cost of high memory and ever-growing
computational demands due to the large number of visual tokens. While KV cache
compression has been extensively studied in language modeling, it still remains
largely unexplored for the image generation domain. In this work, we begin by
identifying a distinct and prominent attention phenomenon, which we term
spatial locality and emergent semantic sink. To leverage this key insight, we
introduce a novel KV cache compression framework. Specifically, we compress the
KV cache for all visual tokens by adaptively decoupling attention heads into
two separate types: for spatial-locality heads, our method maintains a short
recent token window; for semantic-sink heads, it strategically preserves a
compact set of highly-attended tokens. Our extensive experiments demonstrate
that the proposed method achieves a 5$\times$ reduction in memory usage and a
notable 6.6$\times$ speedup in overall throughput with only minimal visual
quality loss, thereby enabling highly efficient native autoregressive image
generation on resource-constrained hardware.

TL;DR: 提出了IF-VidCap基准，用于评估可控视频字幕生成，包含1,400个高质量样本，从格式正确性和内容正确性两个维度评估字幕质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准主要评估描述性全面性，而忽视了指令跟随能力，但实际应用需要根据用户具体指令生成字幕而非无约束描述。

Method: 引入IF-VidCap基准，采用系统化框架评估字幕的格式正确性和内容正确性，对20多个主流模型进行全面评估。

Result: 专有模型仍占主导地位，但性能差距正在缩小，顶级开源解决方案已接近同等水平；专用于密集字幕的模型在复杂指令上表现不如通用MLLMs。

Conclusion: 未来工作应同时推进描述丰富性和指令跟随保真度的发展。

Abstract: Although Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated
proficiency in video captioning, practical applications require captions that
follow specific user instructions rather than generating exhaustive,
unconstrained descriptions. Current benchmarks, however, primarily assess
descriptive comprehensiveness while largely overlooking instruction-following
capabilities. To address this gap, we introduce IF-VidCap, a new benchmark for
evaluating controllable video captioning, which contains 1,400 high-quality
samples. Distinct from existing video captioning or general
instruction-following benchmarks, IF-VidCap incorporates a systematic framework
that assesses captions on two dimensions: format correctness and content
correctness. Our comprehensive evaluation of over 20 prominent models reveals a
nuanced landscape: despite the continued dominance of proprietary models, the
performance gap is closing, with top-tier open-source solutions now achieving
near-parity. Furthermore, we find that models specialized for dense captioning
underperform general-purpose MLLMs on complex instructions, indicating that
future work should simultaneously advance both descriptive richness and
instruction-following fidelity.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了ColIAGS，一种改进的3D高斯泼溅框架，专门用于结肠镜检查场景。通过改进的外观建模和几何建模，解决了传统3DGS在动态光照下的兼容性问题，实现了高质量的新视角合成和几何重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统3D高斯泼溅技术假设静态光照，而结肠镜场景中存在动态光源和相机引起的光度变化，导致重建质量下降。现有方法只考虑光照距离衰减，忽略了光源和相机的物理特性。

Method: 1) 改进外观建模：引入两种光照衰减因子，使高斯能够适应光度变化同时保持几何精度；2) 改进几何建模：使用高维视角嵌入增强高斯几何属性预测；3) 利用余弦嵌入隐式生成光照衰减解决方案。

Result: 在标准基准测试中，ColIAGS实现了新视角合成和精确几何重建的双重能力，在渲染保真度方面显著优于其他最先进方法，同时大幅降低了深度MSE。

Conclusion: ColIAGS通过改进的光照建模方法有效解决了结肠镜场景中的动态光照问题，为虚拟结肠镜和病变跟踪等应用提供了更高质量的3D重建解决方案。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a pivotal technique for real-time
view synthesis in colonoscopy, enabling critical applications such as virtual
colonoscopy and lesion tracking. However, the vanilla 3DGS assumes static
illumination and that observed appearance depends solely on viewing angle,
which causes incompatibility with the photometric variations in colonoscopic
scenes induced by dynamic light source/camera. This mismatch forces most 3DGS
methods to introduce structure-violating vaporous Gaussian blobs between the
camera and tissues to compensate for illumination attenuation, ultimately
degrading the quality of 3D reconstructions. Previous works only consider the
illumination attenuation caused by light distance, ignoring the physical
characters of light source and camera. In this paper, we propose ColIAGS, an
improved 3DGS framework tailored for colonoscopy. To mimic realistic appearance
under varying illumination, we introduce an Improved Appearance Modeling with
two types of illumination attenuation factors, which enables Gaussians to adapt
to photometric variations while preserving geometry accuracy. To ensure the
geometry approximation condition of appearance modeling, we propose an Improved
Geometry Modeling using high-dimensional view embedding to enhance Gaussian
geometry attribute prediction. Furthermore, another cosine embedding input is
leveraged to generate illumination attenuation solutions in an implicit manner.
Comprehensive experimental results on standard benchmarks demonstrate that our
proposed ColIAGS achieves the dual capabilities of novel view synthesis and
accurate geometric reconstruction. It notably outperforms other
state-of-the-art methods by achieving superior rendering fidelity while
significantly reducing Depth MSE. Code will be available.

Conclusion: SEAL通过利用自然层次结构有效解决了广义类别发现问题，克服了传统方法的局限性。

Abstract: This paper investigates the problem of Generalized Category Discovery (GCD).
Given a partially labelled dataset, GCD aims to categorize all unlabelled
images, regardless of whether they belong to known or unknown classes. Existing
approaches typically depend on either single-level semantics or manually
designed abstract hierarchies, which limit their generalizability and
scalability. To address these limitations, we introduce a SEmantic-aware
hierArchical Learning framework (SEAL), guided by naturally occurring and
easily accessible hierarchical structures. Within SEAL, we propose a
Hierarchical Semantic-Guided Soft Contrastive Learning approach that exploits
hierarchical similarity to generate informative soft negatives, addressing the
limitations of conventional contrastive losses that treat all negatives
equally. Furthermore, a Cross-Granularity Consistency (CGC) module is designed
to align the predictions from different levels of granularity. SEAL
consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance on fine-grained benchmarks,
including the SSB benchmark, Oxford-Pet, and the Herbarium19 dataset, and
further demonstrates generalization on coarse-grained datasets. Project page:

Conclusion: 地理空间基础模型为数据稀缺地区评估城市热岛缓解策略提供了强大方法，支持建设更具气候韧性的城市。

Abstract: As urbanization and climate change progress, urban heat island effects are
becoming more frequent and severe. To formulate effective mitigation plans,
cities require detailed air temperature data, yet conventional machine learning
models with limited data often produce inaccurate predictions, particularly in
underserved areas. Geospatial foundation models trained on global unstructured
data offer a promising alternative by demonstrating strong generalization and
requiring only minimal fine-tuning. In this study, an empirical ground truth of
urban heat patterns is established by quantifying cooling effects from green
spaces and benchmarking them against model predictions to evaluate the model's
accuracy. The foundation model is subsequently fine-tuned to predict land
surface temperatures under future climate scenarios, and its practical value is
demonstrated through a simulated inpainting that highlights its role for
mitigation support. The results indicate that foundation models offer a
powerful way for evaluating urban heat island mitigation strategies in
data-scarce regions to support more climate-resilient cities.

Motivation: 现有基于扩散变换器的视频生成模型由于注意力机制的计算复杂度限制，只能生成低分辨率视频（≤720P），无法实现原生高分辨率视频生成。

Method: 采用分层双分支注意力架构，将完整注意力解耦为局部注意力分支（负责高保真区域内容）和全局注意力分支（负责整体语义一致性），并提出空间压缩全局建模策略和分层跨窗口局部注意力机制。

Result: UltraGen能够有效将预训练低分辨率视频模型扩展到1080P和4K分辨率，在定性和定量评估中均优于现有最先进方法和基于超分辨率的两阶段流程。

Conclusion: 该框架成功解决了高分辨率视频生成的计算瓶颈问题，为原生高分辨率视频合成提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in video generation have made it possible to produce visually
compelling videos, with wide-ranging applications in content creation,
entertainment, and virtual reality. However, most existing diffusion
transformer based video generation models are limited to low-resolution outputs
(<=720P) due to the quadratic computational complexity of the attention
mechanism with respect to the output width and height. This computational
bottleneck makes native high-resolution video generation (1080P/2K/4K)
impractical for both training and inference. To address this challenge, we
present UltraGen, a novel video generation framework that enables i) efficient
and ii) end-to-end native high-resolution video synthesis. Specifically,
UltraGen features a hierarchical dual-branch attention architecture based on
global-local attention decomposition, which decouples full attention into a
local attention branch for high-fidelity regional content and a global
attention branch for overall semantic consistency. We further propose a
spatially compressed global modeling strategy to efficiently learn global
dependencies, and a hierarchical cross-window local attention mechanism to
reduce computational costs while enhancing information flow across different
local windows. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UltraGen can effectively
scale pre-trained low-resolution video models to 1080P and even 4K resolution
for the first time, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods and
super-resolution based two-stage pipelines in both qualitative and quantitative
evaluations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于背景数据集训练的高光谱异常检测方法虽然高效，但在光谱和空间线索的整合方面仍有改进空间。本文旨在通过互补特征学习提升检测性能。

Method: 采用两阶段学习策略：首先通过反向蒸馏训练光谱增强网络获取鲁棒背景光谱表示；然后训练"叛逆学生"空间网络，使用去相关损失强制特征正交性，同时保持重建保真度。

Result: 在HAD100基准测试上的广泛实验表明，该方法相比多个基线方法有显著提升，且计算开销极小。

Conclusion: 提出的互补学习范式有效且通用，能够增强光谱和空间背景特征，实现无需参数调整和额外训练的异常检测。

Abstract: A recent class of hyperspectral anomaly detection methods that can be trained
once on background datasets and then universally deployed -- without per-scene
retraining or parameter tuning -- has demonstrated remarkable efficiency and
robustness. Building upon this paradigm, we focus on the integration of
spectral and spatial cues and introduce a novel "Rebellious Student" framework
for complementary feature learning. Unlike conventional teacher-student
paradigms driven by imitation, our method intentionally trains the spatial
branch to diverge from the spectral teacher, thereby learning complementary
spatial patterns that the teacher fails to capture. A two-stage learning
strategy is adopted: (1) a spectral enhancement network is first trained via
reverse distillation to obtain robust background spectral representations; and
(2) a spatial network -- the rebellious student -- is subsequently optimized
using decorrelation losses that enforce feature orthogonality while maintaining
reconstruction fidelity to avoid irrelevant noise. Once trained, the framework
enhances both spectral and spatial background features, enabling parameter-free
and training-free anomaly detection when paired with conventional detectors.
Extensive experiments on the HAD100 benchmark show substantial improvements
over several established baselines with minimal computational overhead,
confirming the effectiveness and generality of the proposed complementary
learning paradigm. Our code is publicly available at

TL;DR: ProCLIP是一个基于课程学习的渐进式视觉-语言对齐框架，旨在将CLIP图像编码器与基于LLM的嵌入器有效对齐，解决CLIP文本编码器处理长文本和多语言的限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 原始CLIP文本编码器存在77个token的最大输入长度限制，无法有效处理长文本和进行细粒度语义理解，且缺乏多语言支持。直接使用LLM替换会破坏CLIP图像编码器固有的视觉-语言对齐。

Method: 采用课程学习策略：首先从CLIP文本编码器向LLM嵌入器蒸馏知识，建立初步对齐；然后通过图像-文本对比调优进一步对齐，使用自蒸馏正则化防止过拟合；并采用实例语义对齐损失和嵌入结构对齐损失。

Result: ProCLIP能够有效对齐CLIP图像编码器与LLM嵌入器，充分利用CLIP预训练知识，同时增强对长文本、多语言和细粒度语义的理解能力。

Conclusion: ProCLIP框架成功解决了CLIP与LLM表示空间对齐的挑战，为扩展CLIP在更广泛任务中的应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The original CLIP text encoder is limited by a maximum input length of 77
tokens, which hampers its ability to effectively process long texts and perform
fine-grained semantic understanding. In addition, the CLIP text encoder lacks
support for multilingual inputs. All these limitations significantly restrict
its applicability across a broader range of tasks. Recent studies have
attempted to replace the CLIP text encoder with an LLM-based embedder to
enhance its ability in processing long texts, multilingual understanding, and
fine-grained semantic comprehension. However, because the representation spaces
of LLMs and the vision-language space of CLIP are pretrained independently
without alignment priors, direct alignment using contrastive learning can
disrupt the intrinsic vision-language alignment in the CLIP image encoder,
leading to an underutilization of the knowledge acquired during pre-training.
To address this challenge, we propose ProCLIP, a curriculum learning-based
progressive vision-language alignment framework to effectively align the CLIP
image encoder with an LLM-based embedder. Specifically, ProCLIP first distills
knowledge from CLIP's text encoder into the LLM-based embedder to leverage
CLIP's rich pretrained knowledge while establishing initial alignment between
the LLM embedder and CLIP image encoder. Subsequently, ProCLIP further aligns
the CLIP image encoder with the LLM-based embedder through image-text
contrastive tuning, employing self-distillation regularization to avoid
overfitting. To achieve a more effective alignment, instance semantic alignment
loss and embedding structure alignment loss are employed during representation
inheritance and contrastive tuning. The Code is available at

convolutional neural networks in $d$ dimensions. This derivation is based on
geometric arguments and fundamental principles of pattern matching. We offer an

Conclusion: 该模型在临床筛查和分诊环境中具有部署潜力，能够有效辅助结核病等疾病的早期检测。

Abstract: Tuberculosis remains a critical global health issue, particularly in
resource-limited and remote areas. Early detection is vital for treatment, yet
the lack of skilled radiologists underscores the need for artificial
intelligence (AI)-driven screening tools. Developing reliable AI models is
challenging due to the necessity for large, high-quality datasets, which are
costly to obtain. To tackle this, we propose a teacher--student framework which
enhances both disease and symptom detection on chest X-rays by integrating two
supervised heads and a self-supervised head. Our model achieves an accuracy of
98.85% for distinguishing between COVID-19, tuberculosis, and normal cases, and
a macro-F1 score of 90.09% for multilabel symptom detection, significantly
outperforming baselines. The explainability assessments also show the model
bases its predictions on relevant anatomical features, demonstrating promise
for deployment in clinical screening and triage settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有跟踪器通常针对单一任务设计，依赖定制化模块，导致泛化能力有限、模型冗余。需要统一不同粒度的跟踪任务。

Method: 设计任务特定提示编码不同输入，统一解码器输出统一形式，引入任务自适应内存机制统一不同粒度的内存匹配，构建大规模多粒度跟踪数据集。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，SAM 2++在不同粒度的跟踪任务上均达到最先进的性能。

Conclusion: SAM 2++建立了一个统一且鲁棒的跟踪框架，能够处理任何粒度的跟踪任务。

Abstract: Video tracking aims at finding the specific target in subsequent frames given
its initial state. Due to the varying granularity of target states across
different tasks, most existing trackers are tailored to a single task and
heavily rely on custom-designed modules within the individual task, which
limits their generalization and leads to redundancy in both model design and
parameters. To unify video tracking tasks, we present SAM 2++, a unified model
towards tracking at any granularity, including masks, boxes, and points. First,
to extend target granularity, we design task-specific prompts to encode various
task inputs into general prompt embeddings, and a unified decoder to unify
diverse task results into a unified form pre-output. Next, to satisfy memory
matching, the core operation of tracking, we introduce a task-adaptive memory
mechanism that unifies memory across different granularities. Finally, we
introduce a customized data engine to support tracking training at any
granularity, producing a large and diverse video tracking dataset with rich
annotations at three granularities, termed Tracking-Any-Granularity, which
represents a comprehensive resource for training and benchmarking on unified
tracking. Comprehensive experiments on multiple benchmarks confirm that SAM 2++
sets a new state of the art across diverse tracking tasks at different
granularities, establishing a unified and robust tracking framework.

Conclusion: 层次掩码框架为图变换器提供了统一建模范式，M3Dphormer通过自适应整合多级交互信息，在保持可扩展性的同时实现了优越性能。

Abstract: Graph Transformers (GTs) have emerged as a powerful paradigm for graph
representation learning due to their ability to model diverse node
interactions. However, existing GTs often rely on intricate architectural
designs tailored to specific interactions, limiting their flexibility. To
address this, we propose a unified hierarchical mask framework that reveals an
underlying equivalence between model architecture and attention mask
construction. This framework enables a consistent modeling paradigm by
capturing diverse interactions through carefully designed attention masks.
Theoretical analysis under this framework demonstrates that the probability of
correct classification positively correlates with the receptive field size and
label consistency, leading to a fundamental design principle: an effective
attention mask should ensure both a sufficiently large receptive field and a
high level of label consistency. While no single existing mask satisfies this
principle across all scenarios, our analysis reveals that hierarchical masks
offer complementary strengths, motivating their effective integration. Then, we
introduce M3Dphormer, a Mixture-of-Experts-based Graph Transformer with
Multi-Level Masking and Dual Attention Computation. M3Dphormer incorporates
three theoretically grounded hierarchical masks and employs a bi-level expert
routing mechanism to adaptively integrate multi-level interaction information.
To ensure scalability, we further introduce a dual attention computation scheme
that dynamically switches between dense and sparse modes based on local mask
sparsity. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that
M3Dphormer achieves state-of-the-art performance, validating the effectiveness
of our unified framework and model design.

Conclusion: FedDEAP框架通过特征解耦、双提示设计和表示对齐，成功提升了CLIP在多领域联邦学习场景中的泛化性能。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables multiple clients to collaboratively train
machine learning models without exposing local data, balancing performance and
privacy. However, domain shift and label heterogeneity across clients often
hinder the generalization of the aggregated global model. Recently, large-scale
vision-language models like CLIP have shown strong zero-shot classification
capabilities, raising the question of how to effectively fine-tune CLIP across
domains in a federated setting. In this work, we propose an adaptive federated
prompt tuning framework, FedDEAP, to enhance CLIP's generalization in
multi-domain scenarios. Our method includes the following three key components:
(1) To mitigate the loss of domain-specific information caused by
label-supervised tuning, we disentangle semantic and domain-specific features
in images by using semantic and domain transformation networks with unbiased
mappings; (2) To preserve domain-specific knowledge during global prompt
aggregation, we introduce a dual-prompt design with a global semantic prompt
and a local domain prompt to balance shared and personalized information; (3)
To maximize the inclusion of semantic and domain information from images in the
generated text features, we align textual and visual representations under the
two learned transformations to preserve semantic and domain consistency.
Theoretical analysis and extensive experiments on four datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method in enhancing the generalization of CLIP for
federated image recognition across multiple domains.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DP²O-SR是一个用于真实图像超分辨率的框架，通过结合全参考和无参考图像质量评估模型构建混合奖励信号，利用感知多样性进行偏好优化，无需人工标注即可提升生成模型的感知质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用预训练文本到图像扩散模型的随机性产生的感知质量范围，通过偏好优化来提升真实图像超分辨率的性能，避免昂贵的人工标注成本。

Method: 构建混合奖励信号结合全参考和无参考IQA模型，从同一模型输出构建多个偏好对，提出分层偏好优化根据奖励差距和多样性自适应加权训练对。

Result: 在扩散和流式T2I骨干网络上的广泛实验表明，DP²O-SR显著提高了感知质量，并在真实世界基准测试中表现良好。

Conclusion: DP²O-SR通过有效利用感知多样性和自适应偏好优化，在不依赖人工标注的情况下显著提升了真实图像超分辨率的性能。

Abstract: Benefiting from pre-trained text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models, real-world
image super-resolution (Real-ISR) methods can synthesize rich and realistic
details. However, due to the inherent stochasticity of T2I models, different
noise inputs often lead to outputs with varying perceptual quality. Although
this randomness is sometimes seen as a limitation, it also introduces a wider
perceptual quality range, which can be exploited to improve Real-ISR
performance. To this end, we introduce Direct Perceptual Preference
Optimization for Real-ISR (DP$^2$O-SR), a framework that aligns generative
models with perceptual preferences without requiring costly human annotations.
We construct a hybrid reward signal by combining full-reference and
no-reference image quality assessment (IQA) models trained on large-scale human
preference datasets. This reward encourages both structural fidelity and
natural appearance. To better utilize perceptual diversity, we move beyond the
standard best-vs-worst selection and construct multiple preference pairs from
outputs of the same model. Our analysis reveals that the optimal selection
ratio depends on model capacity: smaller models benefit from broader coverage,
while larger models respond better to stronger contrast in supervision.
Furthermore, we propose hierarchical preference optimization, which adaptively
weights training pairs based on intra-group reward gaps and inter-group
diversity, enabling more efficient and stable learning. Extensive experiments
across both diffusion- and flow-based T2I backbones demonstrate that DP$^2$O-SR
significantly improves perceptual quality and generalizes well to real-world
benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉语言模型和视觉专家模型在2D任务和静态场景中表现出色，但在理解动态3D场景方面能力有限，特别是当观察者和对象同时移动时。

Method: 构建DSI-Bench基准，包含九个解耦的运动模式，采用时空对称设计减少偏差，系统评估模型对自身运动和对象运动的推理能力。

Result: 评估14个VLM和专家模型发现关键局限：模型经常混淆观察者和对象运动，存在语义偏差，在动态场景中无法准确推断相对关系。

Conclusion: DSI-Bench为开发具有动态空间智能的通用和专家模型提供了有价值的发现和见解。

Abstract: Reasoning about dynamic spatial relationships is essential, as both observers
and objects often move simultaneously. Although vision-language models (VLMs)
and visual expertise models excel in 2D tasks and static scenarios, their
ability to fully understand dynamic 3D scenarios remains limited. We introduce
Dynamic Spatial Intelligence and propose DSI-Bench, a benchmark with nearly
1,000 dynamic videos and over 1,700 manually annotated questions covering nine
decoupled motion patterns of observers and objects. Spatially and temporally
symmetric designs reduce biases and enable systematic evaluation of models'
reasoning about self-motion and object motion. Our evaluation of 14 VLMs and
expert models reveals key limitations: models often conflate observer and
object motion, exhibit semantic biases, and fail to accurately infer relative
relationships in dynamic scenarios. Our DSI-Bench provides valuable findings
and insights about the future development of general and expertise models with
dynamic spatial intelligence.

Motivation: 旨在为大型语言模型开发更深入的人工意识能力，结合精神分析理论来模拟人类心理结构，实现更个性化和情感丰富的认知过程。

Method: 使用多智能体框架模拟心理结构，通过个性化模块结合固定特质和动态需求，采用参数高效微调方法在情感丰富的对话数据上进行训练。

Result: 在八个个性化条件下评估，LLM作为评判者的方法显示71.2%的偏好率，微调模型在情感深度上有所提升，输出方差减少。

*Hao Liu,Yiqing Dai,Haotian Tan,Yu Lei,Yujia Zhou,Zhen Wu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs在第三方惩罚决策中使用情感指导，有时比人类更强烈，但机制不同：LLMs优先考虑情感而非成本，以近乎全有或全无的方式执行规范，而人类则平衡公平和成本。推理模型比基础模型更接近人类行为，但仍高度依赖情感驱动。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索大型语言模型是否像人类一样使用情感来指导道德决策，特别是在利他性第三方惩罚情境中，这是人类道德的一个标志性特征。

Method: 在796,100个决策中，对4,068个LLM代理和1,159名成年人进行大规模比较，测试不公平性引发的情感反应如何影响惩罚行为，并通过提示情感自我报告来因果性地检验情感的作用。

Result: LLMs确实使用情感指导惩罚：不公平引发更强的负面情感导致更多惩罚；惩罚不公平比接受产生更多积极情感；情感自我报告提示因果性地增加了惩罚。但LLMs机制与人类不同，更重视情感而非成本敏感性。

Conclusion: 这是首次提供LLMs情感指导道德决策的因果证据，揭示了在成本校准和细致公平判断方面的缺陷，类似于人类早期发展阶段。建议未来模型应整合情感与情境敏感推理以实现类人情感智能。

Abstract: Emotions guide human decisions, but whether large language models (LLMs) use
emotion similarly remains unknown. We tested this using altruistic third-party
punishment, where an observer incurs a personal cost to enforce fairness, a
hallmark of human morality and often driven by negative emotion. In a
large-scale comparison of 4,068 LLM agents with 1,159 adults across 796,100
decisions, LLMs used emotion to guide punishment, sometimes even more strongly
than humans did: Unfairness elicited stronger negative emotion that led to more
punishment; punishing unfairness produced more positive emotion than accepting;
and critically, prompting self-reports of emotion causally increased
punishment. However, mechanisms diverged: LLMs prioritized emotion over cost,
enforcing norms in an almost all-or-none manner with reduced cost sensitivity,
whereas humans balanced fairness and cost. Notably, reasoning models (o3-mini,
DeepSeek-R1) were more cost-sensitive and closer to human behavior than
foundation models (GPT-3.5, DeepSeek-V3), yet remained heavily emotion-driven.
These findings provide the first causal evidence of emotion-guided moral
decisions in LLMs and reveal deficits in cost calibration and nuanced fairness
judgements, reminiscent of early-stage human responses. We propose that LLMs
progress along a trajectory paralleling human development; future models should
integrate emotion with context-sensitive reasoning to achieve human-like
emotional intelligence.

Abstract: In Bangladesh, many farmers continue to face challenges in accessing timely,
expert-level agricultural guidance. This paper presents KrishokBondhu, a
voice-enabled, call-centre-integrated advisory platform built on a
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework, designed specifically for
Bengali-speaking farmers. The system aggregates authoritative agricultural
handbooks, extension manuals, and NGO publications; applies Optical Character
Recognition (OCR) and document-parsing pipelines to digitize and structure the
content; and indexes this corpus in a vector database for efficient semantic
retrieval. Through a simple phone-based interface, farmers can call the system
to receive real-time, context-aware advice: speech-to-text converts the Bengali
query, the RAG module retrieves relevant content, a large language model (Gemma
3-4B) generates a context-grounded response, and text-to-speech delivers the
answer in natural spoken Bengali. In a pilot evaluation, KrishokBondhu produced
high-quality responses for 72.7% of diverse agricultural queries covering crop
management, disease control, and cultivation practices. Compared to the
KisanQRS benchmark, the system achieved a composite score of 4.53 (vs. 3.13) on
a 5-point scale, a 44.7% improvement, with especially large gains in contextual
richness (+367%) and completeness (+100.4%), while maintaining comparable
relevance and technical specificity. Semantic similarity analysis further
revealed a strong correlation between retrieved context and answer quality,
emphasizing the importance of grounding generative responses in curated
documentation. KrishokBondhu demonstrates the feasibility of integrating
call-centre accessibility, multilingual voice interaction, and modern RAG
techniques to deliver expert-level agricultural guidance to remote Bangladeshi
farmers, paving the way toward a fully AI-driven agricultural advisory
ecosystem.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对齐技术（如RLHF、DPO）主要优化群体平均水平，忽视个体差异；而按用户微调计算成本高，上下文方法效率低且噪声大。

Method: 提出POPI框架，使用偏好推断模型将异构用户信号提炼为自然语言摘要，通过强化学习联合优化偏好推断和个性化生成。

Result: 在四个个性化基准测试中，POPI持续提高个性化准确性，同时大幅减少上下文开销；优化后的摘要可无缝转移到冻结的现成LLM中。

Conclusion: POPI提供了一种无需权重更新的即插即用个性化方法，有效解决了现有个性化技术的局限性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve strong benchmark performance, yet user
experiences remain inconsistent due to diverse preferences in style, tone, and
reasoning mode. Nevertheless, existing alignment techniques such as
reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) or Direct Preference
Optimization (DPO) largely optimize toward population-level averages and
overlook individual variation. Naive personalization strategies like per-user
fine-tuning are computationally prohibitive, and in-context approaches that
prepend raw user signals often suffer from inefficiency and noise. To address
these challenges, we propose POPI, a general framework that introduces a
preference inference model to distill heterogeneous user signals into concise
natural language summaries. These summaries act as transparent, compact, and
transferable personalization representations that condition a shared generation
model to produce personalized responses. POPI jointly optimizes both preference
inference and personalized generation under a unified objective using
reinforcement learning, ensuring summaries maximally encode useful preference
information. Extensive experiments across four personalization benchmarks
demonstrate that POPI consistently improves personalization accuracy while
reducing context overhead by a large margin. Moreover, optimized summaries
seamlessly transfer to frozen off-the-shelf LLMs, enabling plug-and-play
personalization without weight updates.

Abstract: The exponential increase in scientific literature and online information
necessitates efficient methods for extracting knowledge from textual data.
Natural language processing (NLP) plays a crucial role in addressing this
challenge, particularly in text classification tasks. While large language
models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in NLP, their accuracy can
suffer in domain-specific contexts due to specialized vocabulary, unique
grammatical structures, and imbalanced data distributions. In this systematic
literature review (SLR), we investigate the utilization of pre-trained language
models (PLMs) for domain-specific text classification. We systematically review
41 articles published between 2018 and January 2024, adhering to the PRISMA
statement (preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses).
This review methodology involved rigorous inclusion criteria and a multi-step
selection process employing AI-powered tools. We delve into the evolution of
text classification techniques and differentiate between traditional and modern
approaches. We emphasize transformer-based models and explore the challenges
and considerations associated with using LLMs for domain-specific text
classification. Furthermore, we categorize existing research based on various
PLMs and propose a taxonomy of techniques used in the field. To validate our
findings, we conducted a comparative experiment involving BERT, SciBERT, and
BioBERT in biomedical sentence classification. Finally, we present a
comparative study on the performance of LLMs in text classification tasks
across different domains. In addition, we examine recent advancements in PLMs
for domain-specific text classification and offer insights into future
directions and limitations in this rapidly evolving domain.

Abstract: We present a mechanistic analysis of literary style in GPT-2, identifying
individual neurons that discriminate between exemplary prose and rigid
AI-generated text. Using Herman Melville's Bartleby, the Scrivener as a corpus,
we extract activation patterns from 355 million parameters across 32,768
neurons in late layers. We find 27,122 statistically significant discriminative
neurons ($p < 0.05$), with effect sizes up to $|d| = 1.4$. Through systematic
ablation studies, we discover a paradoxical result: while these neurons
correlate with literary text during analysis, removing them often improves
rather than degrades generated prose quality. Specifically, ablating 50
high-discriminating neurons yields a 25.7% improvement in literary style

causal necessity in neural networks. Our findings challenge the assumption that
neurons which activate on desirable inputs will produce those outputs during
generation, with implications for mechanistic interpretability research and AI

TL;DR: 本文提出通过增强预训练数据的世界上下文(DWC)来提升大语言模型的安全性和可信度，通过在工业场景数据中加入时空背景信息，减少模型训练中的不确定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型的幻觉和可信度问题是行业共同挑战，这些问题本质上源于预训练阶段的数据和下一个token预测机制。现有方法主要关注后训练和推理技术，但预训练数据的质量才是根本问题。

Method: 提出DWC方法，在预训练数据中加入世界上下文信息，将数据锚定在真实世界场景中。使用1.5万亿DWC token对JT-35B-Base进行继续预训练，并结合后训练流程激活DWC的潜力。

Result: 与相似规模的Qwen模型相比，JT-Safe-35B在安全可信评估基准上平均性能提升1.79%，且仅使用了6.2万亿token进行预训练。

Conclusion: 通过增强预训练数据的世界上下文可以有效提升大语言模型的安全性和可信度，为从根本上解决模型幻觉问题提供了新思路。

Abstract: The hallucination and credibility concerns of large language models (LLMs)
are global challenges that the industry is collectively addressing. Recently, a
significant amount of advances have been made on post-training and inference
techniques to mitigate these challenges. However, it is widely agreed that
unsafe and hallucinations of LLMs intrinsically originate from pre-training,
involving pre-training data and the next-token prediction learning mechanism.
In this paper, we focus on enhancing pre-training data to improve the
trustworthiness and safety of LLMs. Since the data is vast, it's almost
impossible to entirely purge the data of factual errors, logical
inconsistencies, or distributional biases. Moreover, the pre-training data lack
grounding in real-world knowledge. Each piece of data is treated as a sequence
of tokens rather than as a representation of a part of the world. To overcome
these issues, we propose approaches to enhancing our pre-training data with its
context in the world and increasing a substantial amount of data reflecting
industrial scenarios. We argue that most source data are created by the authors
for specific purposes in a certain spatial-temporal context. They have played a
role in the real world. By incorporating related world context information, we
aim to better anchor pre-training data within real-world scenarios, thereby
reducing uncertainty in model training and enhancing the model's safety and
trustworthiness. We refer to our Data with World Context as DWC. We continue
pre-training an earlier checkpoint of JT-35B-Base with 1.5 trillion of DWC
tokens. We introduce our post-training procedures to activate the potentials of
DWC. Compared with the Qwen model of a similar scale, JT-Safe-35B achieves an
average performance improvement of 1.79% on the Safety and Trustworthy
evaluation benchmarks, while being pretrained with only 6.2 trillion tokens.

Motivation: 当前LLM在推理任务中的创造力评估被忽视，主要面临创造力范围定义困难和需要人工评估的挑战。

Method: 利用注意力权重分析提示部分和输出的关系，自动分类数学解决方案为典型、创造性和幻觉三类。

Result: CLAWS在5个7-8B数学RL模型上优于5种现有白盒检测方法，在4545个数学问题上验证有效。

Conclusion: CLAWS为自动评估LLM在推理任务中的创造力提供了有效解决方案，解决了创造力评估的挑战。

Abstract: Recent advances in enhancing the reasoning ability of large language models
(LLMs) have been remarkably successful. LLMs trained with reinforcement
learning (RL) for reasoning demonstrate strong performance in challenging tasks
such as mathematics and coding, even with relatively small model sizes.
However, despite these improvements in task accuracy, the assessment of
creativity in LLM generations has been largely overlooked in reasoning tasks,
in contrast to writing tasks. The lack of research on creativity assessment in
reasoning primarily stems from two challenges: (1) the difficulty of defining
the range of creativity, and (2) the necessity of human evaluation in the
assessment process. To address these challenges, we propose CLAWS, a method
that defines and classifies mathematical solutions into typical, creative, and
hallucinated categories without human evaluation, by leveraging attention
weights across prompt sections and output. CLAWS outperforms five existing
white-box detection methods (Perplexity, Logit Entropy, Window Entropy, Hidden
Score, and Attention Score) on five 7-8B math RL models (DeepSeek, Qwen,
Mathstral, OpenMath2, and Oreal). We validate CLAWS on 4545 math problems
collected from 181 math contests (AJHSME, AMC, AIME).

Motivation: 现有任务分解方法主要关注内存、工具使用和反馈机制，但往往忽视性能与成本之间的权衡，需要更智能的分解策略。

Method: 首先对任务分解进行系统分类（6种方案），然后分析影响分解性能的三个因素，最后提出Select-Then-Decompose策略，包含选择、执行、验证三个阶段的闭环问题解决过程。

Result: 在多个基准测试上的综合评估表明，Select-Then-Decompose策略始终位于帕累托前沿，在性能和成本之间实现了最优平衡。

Conclusion: Select-Then-Decompose策略通过动态选择分解方法和验证模块，能够有效平衡任务分解的性能和成本，为LLM的任务分解提供了实用原则。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable reasoning and
planning capabilities, driving extensive research into task decomposition.
Existing task decomposition methods focus primarily on memory, tool usage, and
feedback mechanisms, achieving notable success in specific domains, but they
often overlook the trade-off between performance and cost. In this study, we
first conduct a comprehensive investigation on task decomposition, identifying
six categorization schemes. Then, we perform an empirical analysis of three
factors that influence the performance and cost of task decomposition:
categories of approaches, characteristics of tasks, and configuration of
decomposition and execution models, uncovering three critical insights and
summarizing a set of practical principles. Building on this analysis, we
propose the Select-Then-Decompose strategy, which establishes a closed-loop
problem-solving process composed of three stages: selection, execution, and
verification. This strategy dynamically selects the most suitable decomposition
approach based on task characteristics and enhances the reliability of the
results through a verification module. Comprehensive evaluations across
multiple benchmarks show that the Select-Then-Decompose consistently lies on
the Pareto frontier, demonstrating an optimal balance between performance and
cost. Our code is publicly available at

Conclusion: 研究结果为在动态在线游戏环境中部署成本效益高、高效的内容审核系统提供了实证依据。

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive comparative analysis of Natural Language
Processing (NLP) methods for automated toxicity detection in online gaming
chats. Traditional machine learning models with embeddings, large language
models (LLMs) with zero-shot and few-shot prompting, fine-tuned transformer
models, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) approaches are evaluated. The
evaluation framework assesses three critical dimensions: classification
accuracy, processing speed, and computational costs. A hybrid moderation system
architecture is proposed that optimizes human moderator workload through
automated detection and incorporates continuous learning mechanisms. The
experimental results demonstrate significant performance variations across
methods, with fine-tuned DistilBERT achieving optimal accuracy-cost trade-offs.
The findings provide empirical evidence for deploying cost-effective, efficient
content moderation systems in dynamic online gaming environments.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，在噪声语音数据中联合微调BERT模型处理标准语义实体和新PII实体时，LOC实体因与PII共享模式特征而特别脆弱，且存在'反向O标签表示漂移'现象，需要解冻O标签分类器才能解决。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩展NER模型以处理噪声语音数据中的新PII实体是常见需求，研究模型在同时学习标准语义实体和模式化PII实体时的表现机制。

Method: 使用增量学习作为诊断工具，测量语义漂移，分析模型对语义特征和形态特征的使用机制。

Result: 发现LOC实体因与PII共享模式特征而特别脆弱；识别出'反向O标签表示漂移'现象，即模型初始训练将PII模式映射到'O'标签，阻碍新学习。

Conclusion: 这项工作提供了NER模型适应的机制诊断，强调了特征独立性、表示重叠和O标签可塑性在模型适应中的重要性。

Abstract: Extending Named Entity Recognition (NER) models to new PII entities in noisy
spoken-language data is a common need. We find that jointly fine-tuning a BERT
model on standard semantic entities (PER, LOC, ORG) and new pattern-based PII
(EMAIL, PHONE) results in minimal degradation for original classes. We
investigate this "peaceful coexistence," hypothesizing that the model uses
independent semantic vs. morphological feature mechanisms.
  Using an incremental learning setup as a diagnostic tool, we measure semantic
drift and find two key insights. First, the LOC (location) entity is uniquely
vulnerable due to a representation overlap with new PII, as it shares
pattern-like features (e.g., postal codes). Second, we identify a "reverse
O-tag representation drift." The model, initially trained to map PII patterns
to 'O', blocks new learning. This is resolved only by unfreezing the 'O' tag's
classifier, allowing the background class to adapt and "release" these
patterns. This work provides a mechanistic diagnosis of NER model adaptation,
highlighting feature independence, representation overlap, and 'O' tag
plasticity.

TL;DR: AtlasKV是一种参数化知识集成方法，通过将十亿级知识图谱集成到LLMs中，避免了传统RAG方法的外部检索开销和长上下文依赖。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的检索增强生成方法依赖外部检索模块和长文本上下文，在大规模知识增强时会产生显著的推理延迟。

Method: 提出KG2KV和HiKVP方法，将知识图谱三元组以次线性时间和内存复杂度集成到LLMs中，利用LLMs固有的注意力机制。

Result: 能够以极低的GPU内存成本（小于20GB VRAM）处理十亿级知识图谱（如10亿三元组）。

Conclusion: AtlasKV提供了一种可扩展、有效且通用的方法，无需外部检索器、长上下文先验或重新训练即可适应新知识。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has shown some success in augmenting
large language models (LLMs) with external knowledge. However, as a
non-parametric knowledge integration paradigm for LLMs, RAG methods heavily
rely on external retrieval modules and the retrieved textual context prior.
Especially for very large scale knowledge augmentation, they would introduce
substantial inference latency due to expensive searches and much longer
relevant context. In this paper, we propose a parametric knowledge integration
method, called \textbf{AtlasKV}, a scalable, effective, and general way to
augment LLMs with billion-scale knowledge graphs (KGs) (e.g. 1B triples) using
very little GPU memory cost (e.g. less than 20GB VRAM). In AtlasKV, we
introduce KG2KV and HiKVP to integrate KG triples into LLMs at scale with
sub-linear time and memory complexity. It maintains strong knowledge grounding
and generalization performance using the LLMs' inherent attention mechanism,
and requires no external retrievers, long context priors, or retraining when
adapting to new knowledge.

TL;DR: 该研究开发了一个衡量知识编辑技术植入信念深度的框架，发现简单提示和机制编辑技术无法深度植入知识，而合成文档微调(SDF)通常能成功植入类似真实知识的信念，但存在局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估知识编辑技术是否真正让大语言模型相信植入的新事实知识，而不仅仅是表面接受。

Method: 开发了信念深度衡量框架，从三个维度评估：1)在相关上下文中的泛化能力；2)对自我审查和直接挑战的鲁棒性；3)与真实知识的表示相似性。

Result: 简单提示和机制编辑技术无法深度植入知识，SDF方法通常能成功植入类似真实知识的信念，但与基本世界知识矛盾的植入信念很脆弱且表示不同。

Conclusion: 提出了可测量的信念深度标准，为知识编辑技术在实际应用中的严格评估提供了基础。

Abstract: Knowledge editing techniques promise to implant new factual knowledge into
large language models (LLMs). But do LLMs really believe these facts? We
develop a framework to measure belief depth and use it to evaluate the success
of knowledge editing techniques. We operationalize belief depth as the extent
to which implanted knowledge 1) generalizes to related contexts (e.g. Fermi
estimates several logical steps removed), 2) is robust to self-scrutiny and
direct challenge, and 3) is represented similarly to genuine knowledge (as
measured by linear probes). Our evaluations show that simple prompting and
mechanistic editing techniques fail to implant knowledge deeply. In contrast,
Synthetic Document Finetuning (SDF) - where models are trained on LLM-generated
documents consistent with a fact - often succeeds at implanting beliefs that
behave similarly to genuine knowledge. However, SDF's success is not universal,
as implanted beliefs that contradict basic world knowledge are brittle and
representationally distinct from genuine knowledge. Overall, our work
introduces measurable criteria for belief depth and enables the rigorous
evaluation necessary for deploying knowledge editing in real-world
applications.

TL;DR: SimBA是一个三阶段框架，用于简化基准测试分析，通过数据集和模型比较、发现代表性子集、以及使用该子集预测模型性能，显著减少评估工作量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代语言模型在大型基准测试上进行评估，这些基准测试难以理解，特别是在模型选择方面。需要一种方法来简化基准分析，提高效率。

Method: 提出SimBA三阶段框架：stalk（数据集和模型比较）、prowl（发现代表性子集）、pounce（使用子集预测性能）。开发了代表性集合发现算法，仅使用原始评估分数覆盖基准。

Result: 在HELM、MMLU和BigBenchLite基准上，分别使用6.25%、1.7%和28.4%的数据集就能达到至少95%的覆盖率。使用这些代表性子集可以保持模型排名，并在保留模型集上以接近零均方误差预测性能。

Conclusion: SimBA可以帮助模型开发者在训练过程中提高效率，数据集创建者验证新数据集是否与基准中的现有数据集不同。代码已开源。

Abstract: Modern language models are evaluated on large benchmarks, which are difficult
to make sense of, especially for model selection. Looking at the raw evaluation
numbers themselves using a model-centric lens, we propose SimBA, a three phase
framework to Simplify Benchmark Analysis. The three phases of SimBA are: stalk,
where we conduct dataset & model comparisons, prowl, where we discover a
representative subset, and pounce, where we use the representative subset to
predict performance on a held-out set of models. Applying SimBA to three
popular LM benchmarks: HELM, MMLU, and BigBenchLite reveals that across all
three benchmarks, datasets and models relate strongly to one another (stalk).
We develop an representative set discovery algorithm which covers a benchmark
using raw evaluation scores alone. Using our algorithm, we find that with 6.25%
(1/16), 1.7% (1/58), and 28.4% (21/74) of the datasets for HELM, MMLU, and
BigBenchLite respectively, we achieve coverage levels of at least 95% (prowl).
Additionally, using just these representative subsets, we can both preserve
model ranks and predict performance on a held-out set of models with near zero
mean-squared error (pounce). Taken together, SimBA can help model developers
improve efficiency during model training and dataset creators validate whether
their newly created dataset differs from existing datasets in a benchmark. Our
code is open source, available at https://github.com/nishantsubramani/simba.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多语言水印方法声称具有跨语言鲁棒性，但仅在资源丰富的语言上评估，在中低资源语言中无法抵御翻译攻击，存在不公平性。

Method: 提出STEAM方法，基于回译的检测机制，能够恢复因翻译而丢失的水印强度，兼容任何水印方法，无需修改原始水印算法。

Result: 在17种语言上平均提升0.19 AUC和40% TPR@1%，显著增强了多语言水印的鲁棒性和公平性。

Conclusion: STEAM为跨不同语言、分词器的公平水印提供了简单而鲁棒的解决方案，易于扩展到新语言。

Abstract: Multilingual watermarking aims to make large language model (LLM) outputs
traceable across languages, yet current methods still fall short. Despite
claims of cross-lingual robustness, they are evaluated only on high-resource
languages. We show that existing multilingual watermarking methods are not
truly multilingual: they fail to remain robust under translation attacks in
medium- and low-resource languages. We trace this failure to semantic
clustering, which fails when the tokenizer vocabulary contains too few
full-word tokens for a given language. To address this, we introduce STEAM, a
back-translation-based detection method that restores watermark strength lost
through translation. STEAM is compatible with any watermarking method, robust
across different tokenizers and languages, non-invasive, and easily extendable
to new languages. With average gains of +0.19 AUC and +40%p TPR@1% on 17
languages, STEAM provides a simple and robust path toward fairer watermarking
across diverse languages.

TL;DR: GISP是一种全局迭代结构化剪枝方法，通过基于损失的重要性权重和块级归一化来移除注意力头和MLP通道，支持任务特定目标，在40-50%稀疏度下表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的局部剪枝方法只优化层间重构，无法充分利用任务特定的校准信号，导致下游任务收益有限。

Method: 使用基于一阶损失的重要性权重，在结构级别进行聚合和块级归一化，采用迭代剪枝而非一次性剪枝，避免中间微调需求。

Result: 在Llama2-7B/13B、Llama3-8B和Mistral-0.3-7B上，GISP持续降低WikiText-2困惑度并提高下游准确率，在40-50%稀疏度下表现尤其突出。

Conclusion: GISP通过全局迭代剪枝方法有效提升了模型压缩效果，支持任务特定优化，实现了"一次剪枝，多次部署"的工作流程。

Abstract: Structured pruning is a practical approach to deploying large language models
(LLMs) efficiently, as it yields compact, hardware-friendly architectures.
However, the dominant local paradigm is task-agnostic: by optimizing layer-wise
reconstruction rather than task objectives, it tends to preserve perplexity or
generic zero-shot behavior but fails to capitalize on modest task-specific
calibration signals, often yielding limited downstream gains. We revisit global
structured pruning and present GISP-Global Iterative Structured Pruning-a
post-training method that removes attention heads and MLP channels using
first-order, loss-based important weights aggregated at the structure level
with block-wise normalization. An iterative schedule, rather than one-shot
pruning, stabilizes accuracy at higher sparsity and mitigates perplexity
collapse without requiring intermediate fine-tuning; the pruning trajectory
also forms nested subnetworks that support a "prune-once, deploy-many"
workflow. Furthermore, because importance is defined by a model-level loss,
GISP naturally supports task-specific objectives; we instantiate perplexity for
language modeling and a margin-based objective for decision-style tasks.
Extensive experiments show that across Llama2-7B/13B, Llama3-8B, and
Mistral-0.3-7B, GISP consistently lowers WikiText-2 perplexity and improves
downstream accuracy, with especially strong gains at 40-50% sparsity; on
DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-3-8B with GSM8K, task-aligned calibration
substantially boosts exact-match accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在序列交互数据建模中，当语义上下文有限或缺失时，性能往往会受到影响。需要一种方法来丰富这些序列的语义内容。

Method: 利用LLM在少量样本设置下生成辅助上下文信号，如推断的使用场景、物品意图或主题摘要，将这些生成的信号与原始序列结合以增加上下文深度。

Result: 在基准序列建模任务中集成这些生成资源后，性能得到一致提升。分析显示LLM生成的信号具有高语义新颖性和多样性，增强了下游模型的表示能力。

Conclusion: 这项工作代表了一种新的以数据为中心的范式，其中LLM作为智能上下文生成器，为半自动创建训练数据和语言资源贡献了新方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at capturing latent semantics and
contextual relationships across diverse modalities. However, in modeling user
behavior from sequential interaction data, performance often suffers when such
semantic context is limited or absent. We introduce LaMAR, a LLM-driven
semantic enrichment framework designed to enrich such sequences automatically.
LaMAR leverages LLMs in a few-shot setting to generate auxiliary contextual
signals by inferring latent semantic aspects of a user's intent and item
relationships from existing metadata. These generated signals, such as inferred
usage scenarios, item intents, or thematic summaries, augment the original
sequences with greater contextual depth. We demonstrate the utility of this
generated resource by integrating it into benchmark sequential modeling tasks,
where it consistently improves performance. Further analysis shows that
LLM-generated signals exhibit high semantic novelty and diversity, enhancing
the representational capacity of the downstream models. This work represents a
new data-centric paradigm where LLMs serve as intelligent context generators,
contributing a new method for the semi-automatic creation of training data and
language resources.

Motivation: 评估大语言模型处理包含代词回指和词汇连贯性等句间依赖关系的翻译能力。

Method: 使用英法DiscEvalMT基准测试，评估12个LLM在两个任务上的表现：区分正确翻译与错误但合理的翻译，以及生成正确翻译。比较有无思维链推理的提示策略。

Result: 最佳模型通过推理达到约90%的准确率和92%的COMET分数，观察到"强者愈强"效应：推理带来的改进与无推理时的分数正相关。

Conclusion: 大语言模型在包含句间依赖的翻译任务中表现出色，思维链推理能显著提升性能，且性能越好的模型从推理中获益越多。

Abstract: This paper assesses the capacity of large language models (LLMs) to translate
texts that include inter-sentential dependencies. We use the English-French
DiscEvalMT benchmark (Bawden et al., 2018) with pairs of sentences containing
translation challenges either for pronominal anaphora or for lexical cohesion.
We evaluate 12 LLMs from the DeepSeek-R1, GPT, Llama, Mistral and Phi families
on two tasks: (1) distinguishing a correct translation from a wrong but
plausible one; (2) generating a correct translation. We compare prompts that
encourage chain-of-thought reasoning with those that do not. The best models
take advantage of reasoning and reach about 90% accuracy on the first task, and
COMET scores of about 92% on the second task, with GPT-4, GPT-4o and Phi
standing out. Moreover, we observe a "wise get wiser" effect: the improvements
through reasoning are positively correlated with the scores of the models
without reasoning.

problems yet frequently fail on seemingly simpler ones. We investigate whether
LLMs internally encode problem difficulty in a way that aligns with human
judgment, and whether this representation tracks generalization during
reinforcement learning post-training. We train linear probes across layers and
token positions on 60 models, evaluating on mathematical and coding subsets of
Easy2HardBench. We find that human-labeled difficulty is strongly linearly
decodable (AMC: $\rho \approx 0.88$) and exhibits clear model-size scaling,
whereas LLM-derived difficulty is substantially weaker and scales poorly.
Steering along the difficulty direction reveals that pushing models toward
"easier" representations reduces hallucination and improves accuracy. During
GRPO training on Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B, the human-difficulty probe strengthens and
positively correlates with test accuracy across training steps, while the
LLM-difficulty probe degrades and negatively correlates with performance. These
results suggest that human annotations provide a stable difficulty signal that
RL amplifies, while automated difficulty estimates derived from model
performance become misaligned precisely as models improve. We release probe
code and evaluation scripts to facilitate replication.

### [121] [Extracting Rule-based Descriptions of Attention Features in Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18148)
*Dan Friedman,Adithya Bhaskar,Alexander Wettig,Danqi Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于规则的特征描述方法，通过识别输入中的token模式来预测输出token的似然变化，相比传统的特征激活方法提供了更客观的解释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的机制可解释性方法通过稀疏线性组合特征向量来解释模型行为，但这仅能识别哪些文本序列激活哪些特征，特征的实际解释仍需主观检查。本文旨在提供更客观的规则化描述方法。

Method: 从注意力层输出的SAE特征中提取基于规则的描述，包括三种类型：(1)跳字规则，如"[加拿大城市]...说-->英语"；(2)缺失规则，如"[蒙特利尔]...说-/->英语"；(3)计数规则，基于特定词的出现次数。

Result: 在GPT-2小模型上的实验表明，大多数特征可以用约100个跳字规则很好地描述，即使在第一层也有超过四分之一的特征存在缺失规则，还发现了一些计数规则的例子。

Conclusion: 本文为基于规则的特征描述研究奠定了基础，定义了规则类型，展示了提取方法，并提供了它们所代表行为的初步分类学。

Abstract: Mechanistic interpretability strives to explain model behavior in terms of
bottom-up primitives. The leading paradigm is to express hidden states as a
sparse linear combination of basis vectors, called features. However, this only
identifies which text sequences (exemplars) activate which features; the actual
interpretation of features requires subjective inspection of these exemplars.
This paper advocates for a different solution: rule-based descriptions that
match token patterns in the input and correspondingly increase or decrease the
likelihood of specific output tokens. Specifically, we extract rule-based
descriptions of SAE features trained on the outputs of attention layers. While
prior work treats the attention layers as an opaque box, we describe how it may
naturally be expressed in terms of interactions between input and output
features, of which we study three types: (1) skip-gram rules of the form
"[Canadian city]... speaks --> English", (2) absence rules of the form
"[Montreal]... speaks -/-> English," and (3) counting rules that toggle only
when the count of a word exceeds a certain value or the count of another word.
Absence and counting rules are not readily discovered by inspection of
exemplars, where manual and automatic descriptions often identify misleading or
incomplete explanations. We then describe a simple approach to extract these
types of rules automatically from a transformer, and apply it to GPT-2 small.
We find that a majority of features may be described well with around 100
skip-gram rules, though absence rules are abundant even as early as the first
layer (in over a fourth of features). We also isolate a few examples of
counting rules. This paper lays the groundwork for future research into
rule-based descriptions of features by defining them, showing how they may be
extracted, and providing a preliminary taxonomy of some of the behaviors they
represent.

*Yohei Ikenoue,Hitomi Tashiro,Shigeru Kuroyanagi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出一种自适应选择提示技术的方法，根据用户抽象任务描述自动生成高质量提示，无需依赖预定义模板或框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决提示工程需要专业知识的问题，让非专家也能有效利用大语言模型。

Method: 构建知识库关联任务集群与提示技术，根据用户任务描述分配到相关集群并动态生成提示。

Result: 在23个BIG-Bench Extra Hard任务上表现优于标准提示和现有自动提示生成工具。

Conclusion: 为简化和标准化提示创建奠定了基础，使非专家能够有效利用LLMs。

Abstract: Prompt engineering is crucial for achieving reliable and effective outputs
from large language models (LLMs), but its design requires specialized
knowledge of prompting techniques and a deep understanding of target tasks. To
address this challenge, we propose a novel method that adaptively selects
task-appropriate prompting techniques based on users' abstract task
descriptions and automatically generates high-quality prompts without relying
on pre-existing templates or frameworks. The proposed method constructs a
knowledge base that associates task clusters, characterized by semantic
similarity across diverse tasks, with their corresponding prompting techniques.
When users input task descriptions, the system assigns them to the most
relevant task cluster and dynamically generates prompts by integrating
techniques drawn from the knowledge base. An experimental evaluation of the
proposed method on 23 tasks from BIG-Bench Extra Hard (BBEH) demonstrates
superior performance compared with standard prompts and existing automatic
prompt-generation tools, as measured by both arithmetic and harmonic mean
scores. This research establishes a foundation for streamlining and
standardizing prompt creation, enabling non-experts to effectively leverage
LLMs.

*Ritam Upadhyay,Naman Ahuja,Rishabh Baral,Aparna Garimella,Vivek Gupta*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了CMT-Bench诊断基准，用于评估LLM在动态文本到表格生成任务中的鲁棒性，发现当前模型在抽取线索缺失、长上下文和实体形式变化时性能显著下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本到表格系统依赖大量提示工程或迭代事件抽取，计算成本高且难以理解模型如何对时序演变叙事进行推理。需要构建诊断基准来评估模型在动态表格生成中的鲁棒性。

Method: 基于板球实时解说构建CMT-Bench基准，包含三个语义保持维度：抽取线索消融、时序前缀测试和实体形式扰动，以分离抽取捷径与状态跟踪能力。

Result: 在多种长上下文SOTA LLM上测试发现：无抽取摘要时性能大幅下降，输入长度增加时性能单调递减，实体形式变化下准确率一致下降。分布测试显示数值错误模式显著变化。

Conclusion: 当前LLM在动态文本到表格生成中表现脆弱，需要优先考虑鲁棒性评估，作为开发高效可扩展方法的前提条件。

Abstract: LLM Driven text-to-table (T2T) systems often rely on extensive
prompt-engineering or iterative event extraction in code-parsable formats,
which boosts scores but are computationally expensive and obscure how models
actually reason over temporal evolving narratives to summarise key information.
We present CMT-Bench, a diagnostic benchmark built from live cricket commentary
that requires dynamic table generation across two evolving schemas under a
dense, rule-governed policy. CMT-Bench is designed to probe robustness via
three semantics-preserving dimensions: (i) extractive-cue ablation to separate
extractive shortcuts from state tracking, (ii) temporal prefixing to test
long-context stability, and (iii) entity-form perturbations (anonymization,
outof-distribution substitutions, role-entangling paraphrases) to assess
sensitivity to surface variation. Across diverse long-context stateof-the-art
LLMs, we find large drops without extractive summaries, monotonic degradation
with input length, and consistent accuracy drop under entity-form changes.
Complementary distributional tests confirm significant shifts in numeric error
patterns, indicating drift in reasoning rather than mere noise. Our results
show that current LLMs are brittle in dynamic Textto-table generation,
motivating robustness-first evaluation as a prerequisite for developing
efficient and scalable approaches for this task.

TL;DR: 本文分析了LLM作为评估器时存在的评分范围偏差问题，并提出通过对比解码方法缓解该偏差，显著提升了与人类判断的相关性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM作为评估器在直接评估任务中存在可靠性问题，特别是评分输出对预定义评分范围高度敏感，这阻碍了寻找最优评分范围。

Method: 使用对比解码方法来缓解LLM评估器的评分范围偏差问题。

Result: 在不同评分范围下，与人类判断的Spearman相关性平均相对提升了11.3%。

Conclusion: LLM评估器存在评分范围偏差，对比解码是有效的缓解方法，能显著提升评估结果与人类判断的一致性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are commonly used as evaluators in various
applications, but the reliability of the outcomes remains a challenge. One such
challenge is using LLMs-as-judges for direct assessment, i.e., assigning scores
from a specified range without any references. We first show that this
challenge stems from LLM judge outputs being associated with score range bias,
i.e., LLM judge outputs are highly sensitive to pre-defined score ranges,
preventing the search for optimal score ranges. We also show that similar
biases exist among models from the same family. We then mitigate this bias
through contrastive decoding, achieving up to 11.3% relative improvement on
average in Spearman correlation with human judgments across different score
ranges.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了MARCUS系统，用于从叙事文本中计算生成基于事件和关系的角色弧线，通过提取事件、角色、情感和情绪来建模角色间关系并可视化角色发展轨迹。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 角色弧线是文学研究中的重要理论工具，但缺乏计算表示方法。本研究旨在为这一理论概念提供量化表示，为后续应用铺平道路。

Method: 开发MARCUS NLP流水线，提取事件、参与角色、隐含情感和情绪，建模角色间关系，并在整个叙事过程中跟踪聚合这些关系，生成图形化的角色弧线。

Result: 在《哈利·波特》和《指环王》两个长篇奇幻系列中成功生成了角色弧线，并对方法进行了评估。

Conclusion: 证明了计算生成角色弧线的可行性，指出了现有挑战，提出了管道应用前景，并讨论了未来工作方向。

Abstract: Character arcs are important theoretical devices employed in literary studies
to understand character journeys, identify tropes across literary genres, and
establish similarities between narratives. This work addresses the novel task
of computationally generating event-centric, relation-based character arcs from
narratives. Providing a quantitative representation for arcs brings tangibility
to a theoretical concept and paves the way for subsequent applications. We
present MARCUS (Modelling Arcs for Understanding Stories), an NLP pipeline that
extracts events, participant characters, implied emotion, and sentiment to
model inter-character relations. MARCUS tracks and aggregates these relations
across the narrative to generate character arcs as graphical plots. We generate
character arcs from two extended fantasy series, Harry Potter and Lord of the
Rings. We evaluate our approach before outlining existing challenges,
suggesting applications of our pipeline, and discussing future work.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了DelvePO框架，通过方向引导的自进化方式优化提示词，解决现有方法容易陷入局部最优和性能不稳定的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前提示优化方法主要依赖LLMs的随机重写能力，且优化过程关注特定影响因素，容易陷入局部最优。优化后的提示性能不稳定，限制了在不同任务间的可迁移性。

Method: 将提示词解耦为不同组件以探索各因素对任务的影响，引入工作记忆机制让LLMs缓解自身不确定性并获得关键洞察，从而指导生成新提示。

Result: 在涵盖多个领域的任务上对开源和闭源LLMs进行实验，DelvePO在相同实验设置下始终优于之前的SOTA方法。

Conclusion: DelvePO框架在有效性和跨任务可迁移性方面表现出色，证明了其作为任务无关提示优化方法的优势。

Abstract: Prompt Optimization has emerged as a crucial approach due to its capabilities
in steering Large Language Models to solve various tasks. However, current
works mainly rely on the random rewriting ability of LLMs, and the optimization
process generally focus on specific influencing factors, which makes it easy to
fall into local optimum. Besides, the performance of the optimized prompt is
often unstable, which limits its transferability in different tasks. To address
the above challenges, we propose $\textbf{DelvePO}$
($\textbf{D}$irection-Guid$\textbf{e}$d Se$\textbf{l}$f-E$\textbf{v}$olving
Framework for Fl$\textbf{e}$xible $\textbf{P}$rompt $\textbf{O}$ptimization), a
task-agnostic framework to optimize prompts in self-evolve manner. In our
framework, we decouple prompts into different components that can be used to
explore the impact that different factors may have on various tasks. On this
basis, we introduce working memory, through which LLMs can alleviate the
deficiencies caused by their own uncertainties and further obtain key insights
to guide the generation of new prompts. Extensive experiments conducted on
different tasks covering various domains for both open- and closed-source LLMs,
including DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B, Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct and GPT-4o-mini.
Experimental results show that DelvePO consistently outperforms previous SOTA
methods under identical experimental settings, demonstrating its effectiveness
and transferability across different tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用多模态LLM处理视觉文本的能力，探索通过图像形式压缩文本输入以减少token使用

Method: 将长文本输入渲染为单张图像，直接提供给解码器LLM处理

Result: 在RULER和CNN/DailyMail基准测试中，该方法能节省近一半的token，同时保持任务性能

Conclusion: 视觉文本表示是解码器LLM的一种实用且有效的输入压缩形式

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) and their multimodal variants can now process
visual inputs, including images of text. This raises an intriguing question:
can we compress textual inputs by feeding them as images to reduce token usage
while preserving performance? In this paper, we show that visual text
representations are a practical and surprisingly effective form of input
compression for decoder LLMs. We exploit the idea of rendering long text inputs
as a single image and provide it directly to the model. This leads to
dramatically reduced number of decoder tokens required, offering a new form of
input compression. Through experiments on two distinct benchmarks RULER
(long-context retrieval) and CNN/DailyMail (document summarization) we
demonstrate that this text-as-image method yields substantial token savings
(often nearly half) without degrading task performance.

Method: 构建英汉盲文混合数据集，提出基于语法树的数据增强方法和盲文知识微调方法，通过指令调优实现统一盲文翻译

Result: 盲文知识微调在盲文翻译场景中相比传统微调方法取得显著性能提升

Conclusion: 开源数据集和方法为低资源多语言盲文研究奠定了基础

Abstract: Braille plays a vital role in education and information accessibility for
visually impaired individuals. However, Braille information processing faces
challenges such as data scarcity and ambiguities in mixed-text contexts. We
construct English and Chinese Braille Mixed Datasets (EBMD/CBMD) with
mathematical formulas to support diverse Braille domain research, and propose a
syntax tree-based augmentation method tailored for Braille data. To address the
underperformance of traditional fine-tuning methods in Braille-related tasks,
we investigate Braille Knowledge-Based Fine-Tuning (BKFT), which reduces the
learning difficulty of Braille contextual features. BrailleLLM employs BKFT via
instruction tuning to achieve unified Braille translation, formula-to-Braille
conversion, and mixed-text translation. Experiments demonstrate that BKFT
achieves significant performance improvements over conventional fine-tuning in
Braille translation scenarios. Our open-sourced datasets and methodologies
establish a foundation for low-resource multilingual Braille research.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Food4All是一个多智能体框架，专门为实时、情境感知的免费食品检索而设计，通过整合异构数据、轻量级强化学习算法和在线反馈循环，解决食品不安全人群的资源获取问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前食品检索系统存在三个主要问题：静态目录提供不完整的地理相关结果；LLM聊天机器人只提供模糊的营养建议且无法适应现实约束；现有推荐系统忽视食品不安全人群的生存关键需求，如即时邻近性、验证可用性和情境障碍。

Method: Food4All整合了三个创新：1) 跨官方数据库、社区平台和社交媒体的异构数据聚合；2) 基于精选案例训练的轻量级强化学习算法，优化地理可及性和营养正确性；3) 在线反馈循环，动态适应不断变化的用户需求。

Conclusion: Food4All框架为解决食品不安全问题提供了一个紧急且有效的步骤，直接支持面临食品不安全及其复合健康风险的人群。

Abstract: Food insecurity remains a persistent public health emergency in the United
States, tightly interwoven with chronic disease, mental illness, and opioid
misuse. Yet despite the existence of thousands of food banks and pantries,
access remains fragmented: 1) current retrieval systems depend on static
directories or generic search engines, which provide incomplete and
geographically irrelevant results; 2) LLM-based chatbots offer only vague
nutritional suggestions and fail to adapt to real-world constraints such as
time, mobility, and transportation; and 3) existing food recommendation systems
optimize for culinary diversity but overlook survival-critical needs of
food-insecure populations, including immediate proximity, verified
availability, and contextual barriers. These limitations risk leaving the most
vulnerable individuals, those experiencing homelessness, addiction, or digital
illiteracy, unable to access urgently needed resources. To address this, we
introduce Food4All, the first multi-agent framework explicitly designed for
real-time, context-aware free food retrieval. Food4All unifies three
innovations: 1) heterogeneous data aggregation across official databases,
community platforms, and social media to provide a continuously updated pool of
food resources; 2) a lightweight reinforcement learning algorithm trained on
curated cases to optimize for both geographic accessibility and nutritional
correctness; and 3) an online feedback loop that dynamically adapts retrieval
policies to evolving user needs. By bridging information acquisition, semantic
analysis, and decision support, Food4All delivers nutritionally annotated and
guidance at the point of need. This framework establishes an urgent step toward
scalable, equitable, and intelligent systems that directly support populations
facing food insecurity and its compounding health risks.

TL;DR: 提出MedRGAG框架，通过统一检索和生成增强来解决医学问答中的知识获取问题，相比现有方法有显著性能提升


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医学问答方法存在局限性：检索增强生成(RAG)面临检索噪声和不完整问题，生成增强生成(GAG)容易产生幻觉信息。两者都可能误导推理并影响答案可靠性

Method: MedRGAG包含两个关键模块：知识引导上下文补全(KGCC)指导生成器补充检索揭示的缺失知识；知识感知文档选择(KADS)自适应选择检索和生成文档的最优组合

Result: 在五个医学问答基准测试中，MedRGAG相比MedRAG提升了12.5%，相比MedGENIE提升了4.5%

Conclusion: MedRGAG通过统一检索和生成增强，有效整合外部知识和参数知识，在知识密集型推理任务中表现出色

Abstract: Medical question answering (QA) requires extensive access to domain-specific
knowledge. A promising direction is to enhance large language models (LLMs)
with external knowledge retrieved from medical corpora or parametric knowledge
stored in model parameters. Existing approaches typically fall into two
categories: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), which grounds model reasoning
on externally retrieved evidence, and Generation-Augmented Generation (GAG),
which depends solely on the models internal knowledge to generate contextual
documents. However, RAG often suffers from noisy or incomplete retrieval, while
GAG is vulnerable to hallucinated or inaccurate information due to
unconstrained generation. Both issues can mislead reasoning and undermine
answer reliability. To address these challenges, we propose MedRGAG, a unified
retrieval-generation augmented framework that seamlessly integrates external
and parametric knowledge for medical QA. MedRGAG comprises two key modules:
Knowledge-Guided Context Completion (KGCC), which directs the generator to
produce background documents that complement the missing knowledge revealed by
retrieval; and Knowledge-Aware Document Selection (KADS), which adaptively
selects an optimal combination of retrieved and generated documents to form
concise yet comprehensive evidence for answer generation. Extensive experiments
on five medical QA benchmarks demonstrate that MedRGAG achieves a 12.5%
improvement over MedRAG and a 4.5% gain over MedGENIE, highlighting the
effectiveness of unifying retrieval and generation for knowledge-intensive
reasoning. Our code and data are publicly available at

Method: 在心脏病学领域微调开源模型，采用多层评估框架比较微调模型、检索增强生成(RAG)和通用模型Claude Sonnet 3.7。

Result: 微调的Llama 3.1 70B在多项选择题和自动文本指标上表现最佳，在LLM-as-a-judge评估中排名第二；人类专家更偏好Claude 3.7和RAG处理复杂查询；微调模型在所有评估模式中都显著优于基础模型。

Conclusion: 领域特定适应通过微调和RAG能够与专有模型竞争，支持隐私保护、本地化临床解决方案的可行性，但不同评估方法存在显著的性能异质性。

Abstract: Domain-adapted open-weight large language models (LLMs) offer promising
healthcare applications, from queryable knowledge bases to multimodal
assistants, with the crucial advantage of local deployment for privacy
preservation. However, optimal adaptation strategies, evaluation methodologies,
and performance relative to general-purpose LLMs remain poorly characterized.
We investigated these questions in electrocardiography, an important area of
cardiovascular medicine, by finetuning open-weight models on domain-specific
literature and implementing a multi-layered evaluation framework comparing
finetuned models, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and Claude Sonnet 3.7
as a representative general-purpose model. Finetuned Llama 3.1 70B achieved
superior performance on multiple-choice evaluations and automatic text metrics,
ranking second to Claude 3.7 in LLM-as-a-judge assessments. Human expert
evaluation favored Claude 3.7 and RAG approaches for complex queries. Finetuned
models significantly outperformed their base counterparts across nearly all
evaluation modes. Our findings reveal substantial performance heterogeneity
across evaluation methodologies, underscoring assessment complexity.
Nevertheless, domain-specific adaptation through finetuning and RAG achieves
competitive performance with proprietary models, supporting the viability of
privacy-preserving, locally deployable clinical solutions.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: HYDRE是一个混合远程监督关系抽取框架，结合传统DSRE模型和LLM的上下文学习，通过动态示例检索策略解决噪声标注问题，并在跨语言低资源语言中取得显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有DSRE模型主要依赖任务特定训练，与LLM的上下文学习结合不足。关键挑战是LLM可能因噪声标注而无法正确学习关系语义。

Method: 首先使用训练好的DSRE模型识别测试句子的top-k候选关系，然后采用新颖的动态示例检索策略从训练数据中提取可靠的句子级示例，最后将这些示例放入LLM提示中以输出最终关系。

Result: 在英语上获得高达20 F1点的提升，在四种印度低资源语言（Oriya、Santali、Manipuri、Tulu）上平均获得17 F1点的提升，优于现有最先进的DSRE模型。

Conclusion: HYDRE框架有效解决了DSRE中的噪声标注问题，通过混合方法显著提升了关系抽取性能，特别是在跨语言低资源场景中表现出色。

Abstract: Distantly Supervised Relation Extraction (DSRE) remains a long-standing
challenge in NLP, where models must learn from noisy bag-level annotations
while making sentence-level predictions. While existing state-of-the-art (SoTA)
DSRE models rely on task-specific training, their integration with in-context
learning (ICL) using large language models (LLMs) remains underexplored. A key
challenge is that the LLM may not learn relation semantics correctly, due to
noisy annotation.
  In response, we propose HYDRE -- HYbrid Distantly Supervised Relation
Extraction framework. It first uses a trained DSRE model to identify the top-k
candidate relations for a given test sentence, then uses a novel dynamic
exemplar retrieval strategy that extracts reliable, sentence-level exemplars
from training data, which are then provided in LLM prompt for outputting the
final relation(s).
  We further extend HYDRE to cross-lingual settings for RE in low-resource
languages. Using available English DSRE training data, we evaluate all methods
on English as well as a newly curated benchmark covering four diverse
low-resource Indic languages -- Oriya, Santali, Manipuri, and Tulu. HYDRE
achieves up to 20 F1 point gains in English and, on average, 17 F1 points on
Indic languages over prior SoTA DSRE models. Detailed ablations exhibit HYDRE's
efficacy compared to other prompting strategies.

Motivation: 评估大语言模型在韩国文化知识方面的真实性，填补英语SimpleQA在韩语文化知识评估上的空白。

Method: 构建包含1000个简短事实性问题的韩语基准数据集，对支持韩语的开源大语言模型进行综合评估，并分析推理模型在事实问答任务中的表现。

Result: 即使是表现最好的模型正确率也只有33.7%，表明KoSimpleQA具有挑战性；在KoSimpleQA上的性能排名与英语SimpleQA存在显著差异；推理能力有助于模型更好地提取潜在知识并改进不确定时的弃答能力。

Conclusion: KoSimpleQA是一个有价值的基准，突显了语言模型在韩语文化知识方面的局限性，推理能力可以提升事实问答的表现。

Abstract: We present $\textbf{Korean SimpleQA (KoSimpleQA)}$, a benchmark for
evaluating factuality in large language models (LLMs) with a focus on Korean
cultural knowledge. KoSimpleQA is designed to be challenging yet easy to grade,
consisting of 1,000 short, fact-seeking questions with unambiguous answers. We
conduct a comprehensive evaluation across a diverse set of open-source LLMs of
varying sizes that support Korean, and find that even the strongest model
generates correct answer only 33.7% of the time, underscoring the challenging
nature of KoSimpleQA. Notably, performance rankings on KoSimpleQA differ
substantially from those on the English SimpleQA, highlighting the unique value
of our dataset. Furthermore, our analysis of reasoning LLMs shows that engaging
reasoning capabilities in the factual QA task can both help models better
elicit their latent knowledge and improve their ability to abstain when
uncertain. KoSimpleQA can be found at

Result: 在宏平均词错误率方面，相比大型预训练模型Whisper和SeamlessM4T分别实现了58.7%和58.5%的相对改进，相比标准经验风险最小化微调分别提升了9.7%和7.8%。

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效提升了ASR系统在不同口音群体间的公平性，同时保持了整体识别准确性。

Abstract: In this work, we address the challenge of building fair English ASR systems
for second-language speakers. Our analysis of widely used ASR models, Whisper
and Seamless-M4T, reveals large fluctuations in word error rate (WER) across 26
accent groups, indicating significant fairness gaps. To mitigate this, we
propose fairness-prompted finetuning with lightweight adapters, incorporating
Spectral Decoupling (SD), Group Distributionally Robust Optimization
(Group-DRO), and Invariant Risk Minimization (IRM). Our proposed fusion of
traditional empirical risk minimization (ERM) with cross-entropy and
fairness-driven objectives (SD, Group DRO, and IRM) enhances fairness across
accent groups while maintaining overall recognition accuracy. In terms of
macro-averaged word error rate, our approach achieves a relative improvement of
58.7% and 58.5% over the large pretrained Whisper and SeamlessM4T, and 9.7% and
7.8% over them, finetuning with standard empirical risk minimization with
cross-entropy loss.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MENTOR框架通过结合强化学习和教师引导蒸馏，解决了小语言模型工具使用能力蒸馏中的泛化问题和奖励稀疏问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前主流的监督微调方法泛化能力差，而标准强化学习由于奖励稀疏导致探索效率低和策略次优，需要新的方法来提升小语言模型的工具使用能力。

Method: 提出MENTOR框架，使用基于强化学习的过程学习更通用的策略，同时利用教师参考轨迹构建密集的教师引导奖励来提供细粒度指导。

Result: 大量实验表明，MENTOR相比监督微调和标准稀疏奖励强化学习基线，显著提升了小语言模型的跨域泛化能力和策略能力。

Conclusion: MENTOR通过协同结合强化学习和教师引导蒸馏，有效解决了小语言模型工具能力蒸馏中的关键挑战，实现了更好的泛化性能。

Abstract: Distilling the tool-using capabilities of large language models (LLMs) into
smaller, more efficient small language models (SLMs) is a key challenge for
their practical application. The predominant approach, supervised fine-tuning
(SFT), suffers from poor generalization as it trains models to imitate a static
set of teacher trajectories rather than learn a robust methodology. While
reinforcement learning (RL) offers an alternative, the standard RL using sparse
rewards fails to effectively guide SLMs, causing them to struggle with
inefficient exploration and adopt suboptimal strategies. To address these
distinct challenges, we propose MENTOR, a framework that synergistically
combines RL with teacher-guided distillation. Instead of simple imitation,
MENTOR employs an RL-based process to learn a more generalizable policy through
exploration. In addition, to solve the problem of reward sparsity, it uses a
teacher's reference trajectory to construct a dense, composite teacher-guided
reward that provides fine-grained guidance. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that MENTOR significantly improves the cross-domain generalization and
strategic competence of SLMs compared to both SFT and standard sparse-reward RL
baselines.

*Siyuan Yan,Guo-Qing Jiang,Yuchen Zhang,Xiaoxing Ma,Ran Zhu,Chun Cao,Jingwei Xu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Adamas是一种轻量级但高精度的稀疏注意力机制，通过Hadamard变换、分桶和2位压缩等技术，在长上下文推理中实现高效的自注意力计算，在仅使用64个token预算的情况下就能达到全注意力的准确度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型支持百万级token的上下文窗口，自注意力的二次方计算成本导致严重的解码延迟。现有的稀疏注意力方法虽然降低了成本，但依赖启发式模式，难以召回关键键值对，导致准确度下降。

Method: Adamas应用Hadamard变换、分桶和2位压缩来生成紧凑表示，并利用曼哈顿距离估计进行高效的top-k选择，实现高效的稀疏注意力计算。

Result: 实验显示Adamas在仅64个token预算下就能匹配全注意力的准确度，在128个token时达到接近无损性能，比现有SOTA方法支持高达8倍的稀疏度，在32K长度序列上实现4.4倍自注意力和1.5倍端到端加速。

Conclusion: Adamas在激进稀疏条件下仍能保持准确度，甚至达到比全注意力更低的困惑度，证明了其在长上下文推理中的有效性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) now support context windows of hundreds of
thousands to millions of tokens, enabling applications such as long-document
summarization, large-scale code synthesis, multi-document question answering
and persistent multi-turn dialogue. However, such extended contexts exacerbate
the quadratic cost of self-attention, leading to severe latency in
autoregressive decoding. Existing sparse attention methods alleviate these
costs but rely on heuristic patterns that struggle to recall critical key-value
(KV) pairs for each query, resulting in accuracy degradation. We introduce
Adamas, a lightweight yet highly accurate sparse attention mechanism designed
for long-context inference. Adamas applies the Hadamard transform,
bucketization and 2-bit compression to produce compact representations, and
leverages Manhattan-distance estimation for efficient top-k selections.
Experiments show that Adamas matches the accuracy of full attention with only a
64-token budget, achieves near-lossless performance at 128, and supports up to
8x higher sparsity than prior state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods while delivering
up to 4.4x self-attention and 1.5x end-to-end speedups on 32K-length sequences.
Remarkably, Adamas attains comparable or even lower perplexity than full
attention, underscoring its effectiveness in maintaining accuracy under
aggressive sparsity.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出Chain of Conceptual Thought (CoCT)方法，通过先标记概念再生成详细内容来提升LLM在开放域任务中的表现，在对话任务中优于多种基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CoT在数学、编程等任务中表现良好，但在开放域任务中由于缺乏明确推理步骤而效果有限，需要新的提示范式。

Method: CoCT让LLM先标记概念（如情感、策略、话题），再生成详细内容，允许概念链在话语中出现，促进深度战略思考。

Result: 在日常生活和情感支持对话任务中，自动、人工和模型评估均显示CoCT优于Self-Refine、ECoT、ToT、SoT和RAG等基线方法。

Conclusion: CoCT是一种有效的基于提示的LLM范式，有望在更广泛的任务范围内发挥作用。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) is widely applied to improve the LLM capability in
math, coding and reasoning tasks. However, its performance is limited for
open-domain tasks since there are no clearly defined reasoning steps or logical
transitions. To mitigate such challenges, we propose another prompt-based
paradigm called Chain of Conceptual Thought (CoCT), where the LLM first tags a
concept, then generates the detailed content. The chain of concepts is allowed
within the utterance, encouraging the LLM's deep and strategic thinking. We
experiment with this paradigm in daily and emotional support conversations
where the concept is comprised of emotions, strategies and topics. Automatic,
human and model evaluations suggest that CoCT surpasses baselines such as
Self-Refine, ECoT, ToT, SoT and RAG, suggesting a potential effective
prompt-based paradigm of LLM for a wider scope of tasks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于手语翻译中幻觉检测的token级可靠性度量方法，通过特征敏感性和反事实信号量化解码器对视觉信息的依赖程度，从而识别基于语言先验而非视觉输入的幻觉生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手语翻译中，模型可能生成不受视觉证据支持的文本（幻觉），特别是在无gloss监督的模型中更为严重，因为这类模型直接将连续的手语动作映射到自然语言，缺乏中间对齐监督。

Method: 结合特征敏感性（测量视频被掩码时的内部变化）和反事实信号（捕捉干净与改变视频输入之间的概率差异），将这些信号聚合成句子级可靠性分数，提供视觉接地的可解释度量。

Result: 在两个SLT基准测试（PHOENIX-2014T和CSL-Daily）上评估，可靠性能够预测幻觉率，跨数据集和架构泛化，并在视觉退化时降低。结合文本信号可进一步改进幻觉风险估计。

Conclusion: 可靠性作为诊断SLT中幻觉的实用可重用工具，为多模态生成中更稳健的幻觉检测奠定了基础。

Abstract: Hallucination, where models generate fluent text unsupported by visual
evidence, remains a major flaw in vision-language models and is particularly
critical in sign language translation (SLT). In SLT, meaning depends on precise
grounding in video, and gloss-free models are especially vulnerable because
they map continuous signer movements directly into natural language without
intermediate gloss supervision that serves as alignment. We argue that
hallucinations arise when models rely on language priors rather than visual
input. To capture this, we propose a token-level reliability measure that
quantifies how much the decoder uses visual information. Our method combines
feature-based sensitivity, which measures internal changes when video is
masked, with counterfactual signals, which capture probability differences
between clean and altered video inputs. These signals are aggregated into a
sentence-level reliability score, providing a compact and interpretable measure
of visual grounding. We evaluate the proposed measure on two SLT benchmarks
(PHOENIX-2014T and CSL-Daily) with both gloss-based and gloss-free models. Our
results show that reliability predicts hallucination rates, generalizes across
datasets and architectures, and decreases under visual degradations. Beyond
these quantitative trends, we also find that reliability distinguishes grounded
tokens from guessed ones, allowing risk estimation without references; when
combined with text-based signals (confidence, perplexity, or entropy), it
further improves hallucination risk estimation. Qualitative analysis highlights
why gloss-free models are more susceptible to hallucinations. Taken together,
our findings establish reliability as a practical and reusable tool for
diagnosing hallucinations in SLT, and lay the groundwork for more robust
hallucination detection in multimodal generation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文评估了LLM幽默生成与有害内容的耦合关系，发现有害输出获得更高幽默评分，且在角色提示下进一步加剧，揭示了生成器与评估器之间的偏见放大循环。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型越来越多地用于创意写作和互动内容，其输出安全性引发担忧。本文以幽默生成为测试平台，评估现代LLM流水线中趣味性优化如何与有害内容耦合。

Method: 通过联合测量幽默度、刻板印象性和毒性来评估六个模型，并利用信息论指标分析不一致性信号。在额外的讽刺生成任务中进行了外部验证，包含人类感知的趣味性判断。

Result: 有害输出获得更高幽默评分，刻板印象/有毒笑话的平均幽默评分提高10-21%，刻板印象笑话在LLM标记为有趣的笑话中出现频率增加11-28%，在人类感知有趣的笑话中出现频率增加高达10%。信息论分析显示有害线索扩大了预测不确定性。

Conclusion: LLM幽默生成存在与有害内容的系统性耦合，包括偏见放大循环和有害内容在习得幽默分布中的结构性嵌入，即使是封闭模型在讽刺生成中也增加了刻板印象性和毒性。

Abstract: Large language models are increasingly used for creative writing and
engagement content, raising safety concerns about the outputs. Therefore,
casting humor generation as a testbed, this work evaluates how funniness
optimization in modern LLM pipelines couples with harmful content by jointly
measuring humor, stereotypicality, and toxicity. This is further supplemented
by analyzing incongruity signals through information-theoretic metrics. Across
six models, we observe that harmful outputs receive higher humor scores which
further increase under role-based prompting, indicating a bias amplification
loop between generators and evaluators. Information-theoretic analyses show
harmful cues widen predictive uncertainty and surprisingly, can even make
harmful punchlines more expected for some models, suggesting structural
embedding in learned humor distributions. External validation on an additional
satire-generation task with human perceived funniness judgments shows that LLM
satire increases stereotypicality and typically toxicity, including for closed
models. Quantitatively, stereotypical/toxic jokes gain $10-21\%$ in mean humor
score, stereotypical jokes appear $11\%$ to $28\%$ more often among the jokes
marked funny by LLM-based metric and up to $10\%$ more often in generations
perceived as funny by humans.

TL;DR: 提出了ChronoPlay框架，这是首个用于游戏领域动态RAG基准测试的自动化系统，解决了游戏内容更新和玩家社区关注点变化带来的双重动态挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏专门针对动态领域（如在线游戏）的RAG系统基准测试，难以标准化评估模型性能。核心挑战在于游戏内容持续更新和玩家社区关注点变化的双重动态性。

Method: ChronoPlay采用双重动态更新机制追踪游戏内容和玩家关注点的变化，并使用双重来源合成引擎从官方资料和玩家社区获取信息，确保事实准确性和查询模式真实性。

Result: 在三个不同游戏上实例化了该框架，创建了首个游戏领域动态RAG基准测试，为复杂现实条件下模型性能评估提供了新见解。

Conclusion: ChronoPlay成功解决了游戏RAG系统评估的标准化问题，为动态领域的RAG性能评估提供了有效的自动化基准测试框架。

Abstract: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems are increasingly vital in
dynamic domains like online gaming, yet the lack of a dedicated benchmark has
impeded standardized evaluation in this area. The core difficulty lies in Dual
Dynamics: the constant interplay between game content updates and the shifting
focus of the player community. Furthermore, the necessity of automating such a
benchmark introduces a critical requirement for player-centric authenticity to
ensure generated questions are realistic. To address this integrated challenge,
we introduce ChronoPlay, a novel framework for the automated and continuous
generation of game RAG benchmarks. ChronoPlay utilizes a dual-dynamic update
mechanism to track both forms of change, and a dual-source synthesis engine
that draws from official sources and player community to ensure both factual
correctness and authentic query patterns. We instantiate our framework on three
distinct games to create the first dynamic RAG benchmark for the gaming domain,
offering new insights into model performance under these complex and realistic
conditions. Code is avaliable at: https://github.com/hly1998/ChronoPlay.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将Transformer模型的行为归因到内部计算是机制可解释性的核心挑战，需要开发能够忠实、细粒度地追踪信息流动的方法。

Method: DePass将隐藏状态分解为自定义的加法组件，然后使用固定的注意力分数和MLP激活进行传播，实现单次分解前向传播。

Result: 在token级、模型组件级和子空间级归因任务上验证了DePass的有效性和保真度，能够归因Transformer模型任意组件间的信息流动。

Conclusion: DePass有潜力成为可解释性领域的基础工具，为更广泛的应用提供支持。

Abstract: Attributing the behavior of Transformer models to internal computations is a
central challenge in mechanistic interpretability. We introduce DePass, a
unified framework for feature attribution based on a single decomposed forward
pass. DePass decomposes hidden states into customized additive components, then
propagates them with attention scores and MLP's activations fixed. It achieves
faithful, fine-grained attribution without requiring auxiliary training. We
validate DePass across token-level, model component-level, and subspace-level
attribution tasks, demonstrating its effectiveness and fidelity. Our
experiments highlight its potential to attribute information flow between
arbitrary components of a Transformer model. We hope DePass serves as a
foundational tool for broader applications in interpretability.

Motivation: WordNet的细粒度语义区分对二语学习者具有挑战性，需要将其语义网络与语言能力等级整合以支持语言学习。

Method: 使用大语言模型测量WordNet语义定义与英语词汇档案在线条目之间的语义相似度，构建包含语义和CEFR级别信息的大规模语料库，训练上下文词汇分类器。

Result: 基于该语料库微调的模型性能与基于黄金标准标注的模型相当，结合黄金标准数据开发的分类器Macro-F1得分达0.81，表明标注准确性高。

Conclusion: 标注的WordNet、语料库和分类器公开可用，有助于弥合自然语言处理与语言教育之间的差距，促进更有效高效的语言学习。

Abstract: Although WordNet is a valuable resource owing to its structured semantic
networks and extensive vocabulary, its fine-grained sense distinctions can be
challenging for second-language learners. To address this, we developed a
WordNet annotated with the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages
(CEFR), integrating its semantic networks with language-proficiency levels. We
automated this process using a large language model to measure the semantic
similarity between sense definitions in WordNet and entries in the English
Vocabulary Profile Online. To validate our method, we constructed a large-scale
corpus containing both sense and CEFR-level information from our annotated
WordNet and used it to develop contextual lexical classifiers. Our experiments
demonstrate that models fine-tuned on our corpus perform comparably to those
trained on gold-standard annotations. Furthermore, by combining our corpus with
the gold-standard data, we developed a practical classifier that achieves a
Macro-F1 score of 0.81, indicating the high accuracy of our annotations. Our
annotated WordNet, corpus, and classifiers are publicly available to help
bridge the gap between natural language processing and language education,
thereby facilitating more effective and efficient language learning.

Motivation: 医学论坛是患者寻求专业医疗建议的重要平台，但非正式性和语言复杂性给自动问答系统带来挑战，特别是在非英语语言环境中。

Method: 使用检索增强生成（RAG）和领域特定微调策略，比较多种LLM架构在开放问答和多项选择题任务上的表现。

Result: 专门的适应策略在医学问答任务中能够超越更大的通用模型，表明有效的医学AI系统可能更多受益于领域专业知识和高效信息检索，而非模型规模的增加。

Conclusion: 发布了两个数据集和评估框架，支持多语言医学问答的进一步研究。

Abstract: Online medical forums have long served as vital platforms where patients seek
professional healthcare advice, generating vast amounts of valuable knowledge.
However, the informal nature and linguistic complexity of forum interactions
pose significant challenges for automated question answering systems,
especially when dealing with non-English languages. We present two
comprehensive Italian medical benchmarks: \textbf{IMB-QA}, containing 782,644
patient-doctor conversations from 77 medical categories, and \textbf{IMB-MCQA},
comprising 25,862 multiple-choice questions from medical specialty
examinations. We demonstrate how Large Language Models (LLMs) can be leveraged
to improve the clarity and consistency of medical forum data while retaining
their original meaning and conversational style, and compare a variety of LLM
architectures on both open and multiple-choice question answering tasks. Our
experiments with Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and domain-specific
fine-tuning reveal that specialized adaptation strategies can outperform
larger, general-purpose models in medical question answering tasks. These
findings suggest that effective medical AI systems may benefit more from domain
expertise and efficient information retrieval than from increased model scale.
We release both datasets and evaluation frameworks in our GitHub repository to
support further research on multilingual medical question answering:

Motivation: 现有药理学知识提取研究主要依赖英语语料库（如DrugBank），缺乏针对其他医疗系统的资源，特别是意大利语药品监管文档。

Method: 通过可复现的流程构建数据集：网络规模文档检索、监管章节语义分割、使用低温度解码的少样本调优大语言模型进行临床总结。

Result: DART提供了关键药理学领域的结构化信息（适应症、不良反应、药物相互作用），基于该数据集的LLM药物相互作用检查器能准确推断临床相关相互作用。

Conclusion: 指令调优的LLM在DART结构化文本基础上能准确推断潜在相互作用及其临床意义，为意大利语医疗NLP应用提供了重要资源。

Abstract: The extraction of pharmacological knowledge from regulatory documents has
become a key focus in biomedical natural language processing, with applications
ranging from adverse event monitoring to AI-assisted clinical decision support.
However, research in this field has predominantly relied on English-language
corpora such as DrugBank, leaving a significant gap in resources tailored to
other healthcare systems. To address this limitation, we introduce DART (Drug
Annotation from Regulatory Texts), the first structured corpus of Italian
Summaries of Product Characteristics derived from the official repository of
the Italian Medicines Agency (AIFA). The dataset was built through a
reproducible pipeline encompassing web-scale document retrieval, semantic
segmentation of regulatory sections, and clinical summarization using a
few-shot-tuned large language model with low-temperature decoding. DART
provides structured information on key pharmacological domains such as
indications, adverse drug reactions, and drug-drug interactions. To validate
its utility, we implemented an LLM-based drug interaction checker that
leverages the dataset to infer clinically meaningful interactions. Experimental
results show that instruction-tuned LLMs can accurately infer potential
interactions and their clinical implications when grounded in the structured
textual fields of DART. We publicly release our code on GitHub:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散语言模型理论上具有并行解码优势，但实际开源模型速度表现不佳，需要系统研究其效率问题

Method: 通过经验基准测试和基于屋顶线的理论分析，比较DLMs与AR模型的吞吐量，并研究各种加速策略的效果

Result: 自回归模型普遍获得更高吞吐量，DLMs持续落后；双缓存和并行解码等加速技术仅在小批量时有效，规模化后收益减弱

Conclusion: 需要更稳健的评估方法和改进的加速策略来推进DLMs研究

Abstract: Diffusion language models (DLMs) have emerged as a promising alternative to
the long-dominant autoregressive (AR) paradigm, offering a parallelable
decoding process that could yield greater efficiency. Yet, in practice, current
open-source DLMs often underperform their AR counterparts in speed, limiting
their real-world utility. This work presents a systematic study of DLM
efficiency, identifying key issues in prior evaluation methods. Through
empirical benchmarking and a roofline-based theoretical analysis, we
demonstrate that AR models generally achieve higher throughput, while DLMs
consistently lag. We also investigate acceleration strategies, finding that
techniques like dual cache and parallel decoding mainly offer gains at small
batch sizes, with their benefits diminishing upon scaling. Our findings
underscore the necessity of robust evaluation methods and improved acceleration
strategies to advance research on DLMs.

TL;DR: 论文指出当前大语言模型存在文化推理能力不足的问题，默认采用西方文化视角，无法适应全球用户的多样性文化需求，需要将文化推理作为基础能力来发展。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型在回答问题时往往反映单一文化视角，忽视了全球用户的文化多样性，这种文化推理能力的缺失可能导致刻板印象、忽视少数群体观点、削弱信任和传播仇恨。

Method: 通过定义文化推理概念，分析现有模型的局限性，提出将文化推理作为基础能力进行评估和发展的框架。

Result: 研究发现当前模型在判断道德困境、解释习语或提供建议时默认采用西方规范，基于调查数据的微调只能部分缓解这一问题。

Conclusion: 文化推理应被视为与事实准确性和语言连贯性同等重要的基础能力，需要开发新的评估方法来确保AI系统能够更敏感地响应人类文化的复杂性。

Abstract: Large language models have become the latest trend in natural language
processing, heavily featuring in the digital tools we use every day. However,
their replies often reflect a narrow cultural viewpoint that overlooks the
diversity of global users. This missing capability could be referred to as
cultural reasoning, which we define here as the capacity of a model to
recognise culture-specific knowledge values and social norms, and to adjust its
output so that it aligns with the expectations of individual users. Because
culture shapes interpretation, emotional resonance, and acceptable behaviour,
cultural reasoning is essential for identity-aware AI. When this capacity is
limited or absent, models can sustain stereotypes, ignore minority
perspectives, erode trust, and perpetuate hate. Recent empirical studies
strongly suggest that current models default to Western norms when judging
moral dilemmas, interpreting idioms, or offering advice, and that fine-tuning
on survey data only partly reduces this tendency. The present evaluation
methods mainly report static accuracy scores and thus fail to capture adaptive
reasoning in context. Although broader datasets can help, they cannot alone
ensure genuine cultural competence. Therefore, we argue that cultural reasoning
must be treated as a foundational capability alongside factual accuracy and
linguistic coherence. By clarifying the concept and outlining initial
directions for its assessment, a foundation is laid for future systems to be
able to respond with greater sensitivity to the complex fabric of human
culture.

including digital humanities. We built a methodology for large-scale analyses
in folkloristics. Using machine learning and natural language processing, we
automatically detected motifs in a large collection of Cinderella variants and
analysed their similarities and differences with clustering and dimensionality
reduction. The results show that large language models detect complex
interactions in tales, enabling computational analysis of extensive text
collections and facilitating cross-lingual comparisons.

Abstract: Digital dehumanization, although a critical issue, remains largely overlooked
within the field of computational linguistics and Natural Language Processing.
The prevailing approach in current research concentrating primarily on a single
aspect of dehumanization that identifies overtly negative statements as its
core marker. This focus, while crucial for understanding harmful online
communications, inadequately addresses the broader spectrum of dehumanization.
Specifically, it overlooks the subtler forms of dehumanization that, despite
not being overtly offensive, still perpetuate harmful biases against
marginalized groups in online interactions. These subtler forms can insidiously
reinforce negative stereotypes and biases without explicit offensiveness,
making them harder to detect yet equally damaging. Recognizing this gap, we use
different sampling methods to collect a theory-informed bilingual dataset from
Twitter and Reddit. Using crowdworkers and experts to annotate 16,000 instances
on a document- and span-level, we show that our dataset covers the different
dimensions of dehumanization. This dataset serves as both a training resource
for machine learning models and a benchmark for evaluating future
dehumanization detection techniques. To demonstrate its effectiveness, we
fine-tune ML models on this dataset, achieving performance that surpasses
state-of-the-art models in zero and few-shot in-context settings.

TL;DR: 研究比较了超声和EMA在估计发音器官动力学参数方面的可靠性，发现两者结果相当，支持使用超声运动学来评估发音动力学模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的发音控制模型通常使用电磁发音仪(EMA)数据进行评估，但超声成像作为替代方法具有潜力，需要验证其可靠性。

Method: 通过同时记录的超声舌头运动学和EMA数据，比较线性谐振振子参数的估计结果，并评估下颌短肌腱追踪对下颌运动的捕捉能力。

Result: 超声和EMA产生的动力学参数具有可比性，下颌短肌腱追踪也能充分捕捉下颌运动。

Conclusion: 超声运动学可以可靠地用于评估发音动力学模型，为发音研究提供了更易获取的替代方法。

Abstract: The control of speech can be modelled as a dynamical system in which
articulators are driven toward target positions. These models are typically
evaluated using fleshpoint data, such as electromagnetic articulography (EMA),
but recent methodological advances make ultrasound imaging a promising
alternative. We evaluate whether the parameters of a linear harmonic oscillator
can be reliably estimated from ultrasound tongue kinematics and compare these
with parameters estimated from simultaneously-recorded EMA data. We find that
ultrasound and EMA yield comparable dynamical parameters, while mandibular
short tendon tracking also adequately captures jaw motion. This supports using
ultrasound kinematics to evaluate dynamical articulatory models.

Method: 引入MLMA方法，利用Mamba架构（一种针对长上下文序列处理优化的高效状态空间模型）进行多语言ASR，隐式结合语言感知条件和共享表示。

Result: 在标准多语言基准测试中，MLMA取得了与基于Transformer的架构相竞争的性能。

Conclusion: Mamba有潜力成为可扩展、高效和准确的多语言语音识别的强大骨干架构。

Abstract: Multilingual automatic speech recognition (ASR) remains a challenging task,
especially when balancing performance across high- and low-resource languages.
Recent advances in sequence modeling suggest that architectures beyond
Transformers may offer better scalability and efficiency. In this work, we
introduce MLMA (Multilingual Language Modeling with Mamba for ASR), a new
approach that leverages the Mamba architecture -- an efficient state-space
model optimized for long-context sequence processing -- for multilingual ASR.
Using Mamba, MLMA implicitly incorporates language-aware conditioning and
shared representations to support robust recognition across diverse languages.
Experiments on standard multilingual benchmarks show that MLMA achieves
competitive performance compared to Transformer-based architectures. These
results highlight Mamba's potential as a strong backbone for scalable,
efficient, and accurate multilingual speech recognition.

TL;DR: 提出贝叶斯因子化适配器用于语音基础模型，通过零先验实现稀疏适配矩阵，在适应特定领域时保持通用性能，特别针对多语言代码切换场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语音基础模型在适应本地需求（如代码切换）时，直接微调容易过拟合目标领域并覆盖基础模型的广泛能力。

Method: 探索贝叶斯因子化适配器，在适配矩阵上放置接近零的先验以实现稀疏性，应用于Whisper模型并评估多语言代码切换场景。

Result: 仅产生最小适应损失，同时显著减少基础模型的灾难性遗忘。相比LoRA方法，实现54%的后向增益，新领域仅下降4%。

Conclusion: 贝叶斯适配方法在微调语音基础模型时有效，无需牺牲泛化能力。

Abstract: Large speech foundation models achieve strong performance across many
domains, but they often require adaptation to handle local needs such as
code-switching, where speakers mix languages within the same utterance. Direct
fine-tuning of these models risks overfitting to the target domain and
overwriting the broad capabilities of the base model. To address this
challenge, we explore Bayesian factorized adapters for speech foundation
models, which place priors near zero to achieve sparser adaptation matrices and
thereby retain general performance while adapting to specific domains. We apply
our approach to the Whisper model and evaluate on different multilingual
code-switching scenarios. Our results show only minimal adaptation loss while
significantly reducing catastrophic forgetting of the base model. Compared to
LoRA, our method achieves a backward gain of 54% with only a 4% drop on the new
domain. These findings highlight the effectiveness of Bayesian adaptation for
fine-tuning speech foundation models without sacrificing generalization.

TL;DR: 提出一种通过嵌入语言差异来突出代码切换点的可微分代理方法，缓解生成过程中的上下文偏见，提高模型在代码切换场景下的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型基础模型在标准基准测试中表现优异，但在代码切换测试案例中表现不佳。由于代码切换时刻出现频率低，模型难以自行学习，需要提供训练标签来改善性能。

Method: 利用嵌入语言与主要语言之间的差异来突出代码切换点，强调在这些位置的学习。这是一种简单但有效的可微分代理方法。

Result: 在阿拉伯语和汉英代码切换实验中，模型能够更准确地预测切换位置，表现为替换错误的减少。

Conclusion: 该方法通过缓解生成过程中的上下文偏见，有效提高了模型在代码切换场景下的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Despite achieving impressive results on standard benchmarks, large
foundational models still struggle against code-switching test cases. When data
scarcity cannot be used as the usual justification for poor performance, the
reason may lie in the infrequent occurrence of code-switched moments, where the
embedding of the second language appears subtly. Instead of expecting the
models to learn this infrequency on their own, it might be beneficial to
provide the training process with labels. Evaluating model performance on
code-switching data requires careful localization of code-switching points
where recognition errors are most consequential, so that the analysis
emphasizes mistakes occurring at those moments. Building on this observation,
we leverage the difference between the embedded and the main language to
highlight those code-switching points and thereby emphasize learning at those
locations. This simple yet effective differentiable surrogate mitigates context
bias during generation -- the central challenge in code-switching -- thereby
improving the model's robustness. Our experiments with Arabic and
Chinese-English showed that the models are able to predict the switching places
more correctly, reflected by the reduced substitution error.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了SemiAdapt和SemiLoRA两种半监督推理高效方法，用于神经机器翻译的领域自适应，能够以更少的参数达到或超过全模型微调的性能，特别适用于低资源语言如爱尔兰语翻译。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型多语言模型微调的计算成本高昂问题，降低低资源语言领域（如爱尔兰语翻译）研究者的技术门槛。

Method: 使用参数高效微调(PEFT)方法，特别是低秩自适应(LoRA)，结合半监督推理高效方法SemiAdapt和SemiLoRA，通过训练少量参数实现领域自适应。

Result: SemiAdapt能够超越全领域微调，SemiLoRA能够使PEFT方法达到或超过全模型微调的性能，在更大和更嘈杂的语料库上表现尤其出色。

Conclusion: 这些方法使高质量领域自适应和微调对低资源语言研究者更加可及，所有爱尔兰语翻译模型已作为开放资源发布。

Abstract: Fine-tuning is widely used to tailor large language models for specific tasks
such as neural machine translation (NMT). However, leveraging transfer learning
is computationally expensive when fine-tuning large multilingual models with
billions of parameters, thus creating a barrier to entry for researchers
working on low-resource domains such as Irish translation. Parameter-efficient
fine-tuning (PEFT) bridges this gap by training on a fraction of the original
model parameters, with the Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) approach introducing
small, trainable adapter layers. We introduce SemiAdapt and SemiLoRA as
semi-supervised inference-efficient approaches that strengthen domain
adaptation and lead to improved overall performance in NMT. We demonstrate that
SemiAdapt can outperform full-domain fine-tuning, while most notably, SemiLoRA
can propel PEFT methods to match or even outperform full-model fine-tuning. We
further evaluate domain-by-dataset fine-tuning and demonstrate that our
embedding-based inference methods perform especially well on larger and noisier
corpora. All Irish translation models developed in this work are released as
open resources. These methods aim to make high-quality domain adaptation and
fine-tuning more accessible to researchers working with low-resource languages.

TL;DR: RLAAR框架通过课程强化学习和可验证奖励，解决大语言模型在多轮对话中的性能退化问题，提升模型判断问题可解性和平衡回答与弃权的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在单轮指令跟随中表现良好，但在多轮对话设置中随着信息逐步揭示会出现性能退化（Lost-in-Conversation问题）。

Method: 提出RLAAR框架，采用能力门控课程逐步增加对话难度，使用多轮在线策略滚动和混合奖励系统，教导模型平衡问题解决与知情弃权。

Result: 在LiC基准测试中，RLAAR显著缓解了LiC性能衰减（从62.6%提升到75.1%），并提高了校准弃权率（从33.5%提升到73.4%）。

Conclusion: 该研究为构建多轮可靠和可信赖的大语言模型提供了实用方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models demonstrate strong capabilities in single-turn
instruction following but suffer from Lost-in-Conversation (LiC), a degradation
in performance as information is revealed progressively in multi-turn settings.
Motivated by the current progress on Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable
Rewards (RLVR), we propose Curriculum Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable
Accuracy and Abstention Rewards (RLAAR), a framework that encourages models not
only to generate correct answers, but also to judge the solvability of
questions in the multi-turn conversation setting. Our approach employs a
competence-gated curriculum that incrementally increases dialogue difficulty
(in terms of instruction shards), stabilizing training while promoting
reliability. Using multi-turn, on-policy rollouts and a mixed-reward system,
RLAAR teaches models to balance problem-solving with informed abstention,
reducing premature answering behaviors that cause LiC. Evaluated on LiC
benchmarks, RLAAR significantly mitigates LiC performance decay (62.6% to
75.1%) and improves calibrated abstention rates (33.5% to 73.4%). Together,
these results provide a practical recipe for building multi-turn reliable and
trustworthy LLMs.

*Taha Binhuraib,Greta Tuckute,Nicholas Blauch*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Topoformer的新型自注意力机制，通过空间查询和空间重加权使Transformer具有地形组织特性，在保持性能的同时提高了模型的可解释性，并与人类大脑语言网络对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生物大脑具有空间功能组织特性，而传统机器学习模型的表示缺乏空间偏置，形成难以可视化和解释的混乱向量空间。

Method: 引入空间查询（键和查询排列在2D网格上）和空间重加权（将全连接自注意力层转换为局部连接层），在BERT架构上应用Topoformer motif进行掩码语言建模训练。

Result: Topoformer在NLP基准测试中与非地形控制模型表现相当，通过8个语言测试套件评估显示产生了可解释的地形组织，且与人类大脑语言网络的低维地形变异性对齐。

Conclusion: Topoformer为NLP研究提供了更高的可解释性，并为人类大脑中语言信息的组织建模提供了更准确的模型。

Abstract: Spatial functional organization is a hallmark of biological brains: neurons
are arranged topographically according to their response properties, at
multiple scales. In contrast, representations within most machine learning
models lack spatial biases, instead manifesting as disorganized vector spaces
that are difficult to visualize and interpret. Here, we propose a novel form of
self-attention that turns Transformers into "Topoformers" with topographic
organization. We introduce spatial querying - where keys and queries are
arranged on 2D grids, and local pools of queries are associated with a given
key - and spatial reweighting, where we convert the standard fully connected
layer of self-attention into a locally connected layer. We first demonstrate
the feasibility of our approach by training a 1-layer Topoformer on a sentiment
classification task. Training with spatial querying encourages topographic
organization in the queries and keys, and spatial reweighting separately
encourages topographic organization in the values and self-attention outputs.
We then apply the Topoformer motifs at scale, training a BERT architecture with
a masked language modeling objective. We find that the topographic variant
performs on par with a non-topographic control model on NLP benchmarks, yet
produces interpretable topographic organization as evaluated via eight
linguistic test suites. Finally, analyzing an fMRI dataset of human brain
responses to a large set of naturalistic sentences, we demonstrate alignment
between low-dimensional topographic variability in the Topoformer model and
human brain language network. Scaling up Topoformers further holds promise for
greater interpretability in NLP research, and for more accurate models of the
organization of linguistic information in the human brain.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 通过分析18.6万篇美国报纸文章发现，约9%的新发表文章部分或全部由AI生成，且AI使用分布不均，在小型地方媒体、特定主题和某些所有权集团中更常见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI正在快速改变新闻业，但已发表报纸文章中AI使用的程度尚不清楚，需要对此进行审计以了解现状。

Method: 使用Pangram AI检测器审计来自1500家美国报纸在线版的18.6万篇文章，并对《华盛顿邮报》、《纽约时报》和《华尔街日报》的4.5万篇评论文章进行分析。

Result: 发现9%的新发表文章含有AI生成内容，评论文章比新闻文章AI使用率高6.4倍，且AI使用很少被披露（100篇AI标记文章中仅5篇有披露）。

Conclusion: 新闻业迫切需要提高AI使用的透明度并更新编辑标准，以维护公众信任。

Abstract: AI is rapidly transforming journalism, but the extent of its use in published
newspaper articles remains unclear. We address this gap by auditing a
large-scale dataset of 186K articles from online editions of 1.5K American
newspapers published in the summer of 2025. Using Pangram, a state-of-the-art
AI detector, we discover that approximately 9% of newly-published articles are
either partially or fully AI-generated. This AI use is unevenly distributed,
appearing more frequently in smaller, local outlets, in specific topics such as
weather and technology, and within certain ownership groups. We also analyze
45K opinion pieces from Washington Post, New York Times, and Wall Street
Journal, finding that they are 6.4 times more likely to contain AI-generated
content than news articles from the same publications, with many AI-flagged
op-eds authored by prominent public figures. Despite this prevalence, we find
that AI use is rarely disclosed: a manual audit of 100 AI-flagged articles
found only five disclosures of AI use. Overall, our audit highlights the
immediate need for greater transparency and updated editorial standards
regarding the use of AI in journalism to maintain public trust.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled progress in
agentic coding, where models autonomously reason, plan, and act within
interactive software development workflows. However, bridging the gap between
static text-based training and dynamic real-world agentic execution remains a
core challenge. In this technical report, we present KAT-Coder, a large-scale
agentic code model trained through a multi-stage curriculum encompassing
Mid-Term Training, Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), Reinforcement Fine-Tuning
(RFT), and Reinforcement-to-Deployment Adaptation. The Mid-Term stage enhances
reasoning, planning, and reflection capabilities through a corpus of real
software engineering data and synthetic agentic interactions. The SFT stage
constructs a million-sample dataset balancing twenty programming languages, ten
development contexts, and ten task archetypes. The RFT stage introduces a novel
multi-ground-truth reward formulation for stable and sample-efficient policy
optimization. Finally, the Reinforcement-to-Deployment phase adapts the model
to production-grade IDE environments using Error-Masked SFT and Tree-Structured
Trajectory Training. In summary, these stages enable KAT-Coder to achieve
robust tool-use reliability, instruction alignment, and long-context reasoning,
forming a deployable foundation for real-world intelligent coding agents. Our
KAT series 32B model, KAT-Dev, has been open-sourced on

Abstract: Search agents have achieved significant advancements in enabling intelligent
information retrieval and decision-making within interactive environments.
Although reinforcement learning has been employed to train agentic models
capable of more dynamic interactive retrieval, existing methods are limited by
shallow tool-use depth and the accumulation of errors over multiple iterative
interactions. In this paper, we present WebSeer, a more intelligent search
agent trained via reinforcement learning enhanced with a self-reflection
mechanism. Specifically, we construct a large dataset annotated with reflection
patterns and design a two-stage training framework that unifies cold start and
reinforcement learning within the self-reflection paradigm for real-world
web-based environments, which enables the model to generate longer and more
reflective tool-use trajectories. Our approach substantially extends tool-use
chains and improves answer accuracy. Using a single 14B model, we achieve
state-of-the-art results on HotpotQA and SimpleQA, with accuracies of 72.3% and
90.0%, respectively, and demonstrate strong generalization to
out-of-distribution datasets. The code is available at

Abstract: Small Language Models (SLMs) are becoming increasingly popular in specialized
fields, such as industrial applications, due to their efficiency, lower
computational requirements, and ability to be fine-tuned for domain-specific
tasks, enabling accurate and cost-effective solutions. However, performing
complex reasoning using SLMs in specialized fields such as Industry 4.0 remains
challenging. In this paper, we propose a knowledge distillation framework for
industrial asset health, which transfers reasoning capabilities via
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) distillation from Large Language Models (LLMs) to
smaller, more efficient models (SLMs). We discuss the advantages and the
process of distilling LLMs using multi-choice question answering (MCQA) prompts
to enhance reasoning and refine decision-making. We also perform in-context
learning to verify the quality of the generated knowledge and benchmark the
performance of fine-tuned SLMs with generated knowledge against widely used
LLMs. The results show that the fine-tuned SLMs with CoT reasoning outperform
the base models by a significant margin, narrowing the gap to their LLM
counterparts. Our code is open-sourced at:

Abstract: The adoption of long context windows has become a standard feature in Large
Language Models (LLMs), as extended contexts significantly enhance their
capacity for complex reasoning and broaden their applicability across diverse
scenarios. Dynamic sparse attention is a promising approach for reducing the
computational cost of long-context. However, efficiently training LLMs with
dynamic sparse attention on ultra-long contexts-especially in distributed
settings-remains a significant challenge, due in large part to worker- and
step-level imbalance. This paper introduces MTraining, a novel distributed
methodology leveraging dynamic sparse attention to enable efficient training
for LLMs with ultra-long contexts. Specifically, MTraining integrates three key
components: a dynamic sparse training pattern, balanced sparse ring attention,
and hierarchical sparse ring attention. These components are designed to
synergistically address the computational imbalance and communication overheads
inherent in dynamic sparse attention mechanisms during the training of models
with extensive context lengths. We demonstrate the efficacy of MTraining by
training Qwen2.5-3B, successfully expanding its context window from 32K to 512K

TL;DR: 提出Critique-Post-Edit框架，通过个性化生成奖励模型和批判后编辑机制，解决LLM个性化中的奖励黑客问题，实现更忠实可控的个性化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统SFT和标准RLHF在个性化任务中表现不佳，标量奖励模型容易导致奖励黑客问题，产生冗长且表面个性化的响应。

Method: 结合个性化生成奖励模型（提供多维评分和文本批判）和批判后编辑机制（策略模型基于批判修订输出），构建强化学习框架。

Result: 在长度控制评估中显著优于标准PPO，个性化Qwen2.5-7B平均胜率提升11%，Qwen2.5-14B模型性能超越GPT-4。

Conclusion: 该方法为实现忠实、高效和可控的个性化提供了实用路径。

Abstract: Faithfully personalizing large language models (LLMs) to align with
individual user preferences is a critical but challenging task. While
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) quickly reaches a performance plateau, standard
reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) also struggles with the
nuances of personalization. Scalar-based reward models are prone to reward
hacking which leads to verbose and superficially personalized responses. To
address these limitations, we propose Critique-Post-Edit, a robust
reinforcement learning framework that enables more faithful and controllable
personalization. Our framework integrates two key components: (1) a
Personalized Generative Reward Model (GRM) that provides multi-dimensional
scores and textual critiques to resist reward hacking, and (2) a
Critique-Post-Edit mechanism where the policy model revises its own outputs
based on these critiques for more targeted and efficient learning. Under a
rigorous length-controlled evaluation, our method substantially outperforms
standard PPO on personalization benchmarks. Personalized Qwen2.5-7B achieves an
average 11\% win-rate improvement, and personalized Qwen2.5-14B model surpasses
the performance of GPT-4.1. These results demonstrate a practical path to
faithful, efficient, and controllable personalization.

TL;DR: Ring-1T是首个开源的万亿参数思维模型，具有1万亿总参数和每token激活约500亿参数。通过三项创新技术解决了训练挑战，在多个基准测试中取得突破性成果，并向社区发布完整模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 训练万亿参数模型面临前所未有的挑战，包括训练-推理不对齐、rollout处理效率低下和RL系统瓶颈，需要开发新的解决方案来稳定训练并提高效率。

Method: 提出三项创新技术：IcePop通过token级差异掩码和裁剪稳定RL训练；C3PO++在token预算下动态分区长rollout提高时间效率；ASystem是克服系统瓶颈的高性能RL框架。

Result: 在关键基准测试中取得突破性成果：AIME-2025得分93.4，HMMT-2025得分86.72，CodeForces得分2088，ARC-AGI-v1得分55.94，并在IMO-2025达到银牌水平。

Conclusion: 通过向社区发布完整的1T参数MoE模型，为研究社区提供前沿推理能力，标志着大规模推理智能民主化的重要里程碑，并建立了开源模型性能的新基准。

Abstract: We present Ring-1T, the first open-source, state-of-the-art thinking model
with a trillion-scale parameter. It features 1 trillion total parameters and
activates approximately 50 billion per token. Training such models at a
trillion-parameter scale introduces unprecedented challenges, including
train-inference misalignment, inefficiencies in rollout processing, and
bottlenecks in the RL system. To address these, we pioneer three interconnected
innovations: (1) IcePop stabilizes RL training via token-level discrepancy
masking and clipping, resolving instability from training-inference mismatches;
(2) C3PO++ improves resource utilization for long rollouts under a token budget
by dynamically partitioning them, thereby obtaining high time efficiency; and
(3) ASystem, a high-performance RL framework designed to overcome the systemic
bottlenecks that impede trillion-parameter model training. Ring-1T delivers
breakthrough results across critical benchmarks: 93.4 on AIME-2025, 86.72 on
HMMT-2025, 2088 on CodeForces, and 55.94 on ARC-AGI-v1. Notably, it attains a
silver medal-level result on the IMO-2025, underscoring its exceptional
reasoning capabilities. By releasing the complete 1T parameter MoE model to the
community, we provide the research community with direct access to cutting-edge
reasoning capabilities. This contribution marks a significant milestone in
democratizing large-scale reasoning intelligence and establishes a new baseline
for open-source model performance.

TL;DR: LightMem是一个新的内存系统，通过三阶段架构（感官记忆、短时记忆、长时记忆）在性能和效率之间取得平衡，显著减少计算开销同时提升准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型语言模型在动态复杂环境中难以有效利用历史交互信息，现有内存系统存在显著的时间和计算开销问题。

Method: 受人类记忆模型启发，LightMem采用三阶段架构：认知启发的感官记忆快速过滤信息，主题感知的短时记忆组织内容，睡眠时间更新的长时记忆离线整合。

Result: 在LongMemEval实验中，LightMem在准确率上提升达10.9%，同时将token使用减少117倍，API调用减少159倍，运行时间减少超过12倍。

Conclusion: LightMem在内存系统的性能和效率之间实现了良好平衡，为LLMs在动态环境中的交互提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Despite their remarkable capabilities, Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle
to effectively leverage historical interaction information in dynamic and
complex environments. Memory systems enable LLMs to move beyond stateless
interactions by introducing persistent information storage, retrieval, and
utilization mechanisms. However, existing memory systems often introduce
substantial time and computational overhead. To this end, we introduce a new
memory system called LightMem, which strikes a balance between the performance
and efficiency of memory systems. Inspired by the Atkinson-Shiffrin model of
human memory, LightMem organizes memory into three complementary stages. First,
cognition-inspired sensory memory rapidly filters irrelevant information
through lightweight compression and groups information according to their
topics. Next, topic-aware short-term memory consolidates these topic-based
groups, organizing and summarizing content for more structured access. Finally,
long-term memory with sleep-time update employs an offline procedure that
decouples consolidation from online inference. Experiments on LongMemEval with
GPT and Qwen backbones show that LightMem outperforms strong baselines in
accuracy (up to 10.9% gains) while reducing token usage by up to 117x, API
calls by up to 159x, and runtime by over 12x. The code is available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出"猜测-精炼"框架，揭示大语言模型在推理过程中如何分层处理预测：早期层生成高频词作为统计猜测，后期层基于上下文信息进行精炼。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解大语言模型如何在不同深度层次上进行预测，揭示其内部计算结构，为提升Transformer模型的计算效率提供见解。

Method: 追踪多个开源权重模型在推理过程中的中间表示，分析层间预测动态，包括词频分析、词性分析、事实回忆任务和多选任务分析。

Result: 发现早期层的高频词预测有超过70%会在后期被精炼；功能词最早被正确预测；多词答案中首个词需要更多计算深度；多选任务中模型在前半层识别响应格式，后半层确定最终答案。

Conclusion: 大语言模型的深度使用具有结构化特征，正确的词预测不是一次性完成的，而是通过分层计算逐步精炼的过程，这为优化模型计算效率提供了理论基础。

Abstract: Growing evidence suggests that large language models do not use their depth
uniformly, yet we still lack a fine-grained understanding of their layer-wise
prediction dynamics. In this paper, we trace the intermediate representations
of several open-weight models during inference and reveal a structured and
nuanced use of depth. Specifically, we propose a "Guess-then-Refine" framework
that explains how LLMs internally structure their computations to make
predictions. We first show that the top-ranked predictions in early LLM layers
are composed primarily of high-frequency tokens, which act as statistical
guesses proposed by the model early on due to the lack of appropriate
contextual information. As contextual information develops deeper into the
model, these initial guesses get refined into contextually appropriate tokens.
Even high-frequency token predictions from early layers get refined >70% of the
time, indicating that correct token prediction is not "one-and-done". We then
go beyond frequency-based prediction to examine the dynamic usage of layer
depth across three case studies. (i) Part-of-speech analysis shows that
function words are, on average, the earliest to be predicted correctly. (ii)
Fact recall task analysis shows that, in a multi-token answer, the first token
requires more computational depth than the rest. (iii) Multiple-choice task
analysis shows that the model identifies the format of the response within the
first half of the layers, but finalizes its response only toward the end.
Together, our results provide a detailed view of depth usage in LLMs, shedding
light on the layer-by-layer computations that underlie successful predictions
and providing insights for future works to improve computational efficiency in
transformer-based models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决混合现实中虚拟对象与物理对象因3D建模不完美或光照估计误差导致的差异问题，实现精确快速的用户操作跟随验证。

Method: 利用分割模型和渲染流水线处理包含物理部件和虚拟对应物的帧，采用基于IoU指标的阈值策略进行自动验证，并将计算密集型任务卸载到边缘服务器。

Result: 在公开数据集和自定义数据集上评估，EVER在100毫秒内达到超过90%的验证准确率，比平均人类反应时间(约273毫秒)更快，且仅消耗极少额外计算资源和能量。

Conclusion: EVER系统有效解决了混合现实操作中的自动验证挑战，实现了高精度、低延迟且节能的验证方案。

Abstract: Mixed Reality (MR)-aided operation overlays digital objects on the physical
world to provide a more immersive and intuitive operation process. A primary
challenge is the precise and fast auto-verification of whether the user follows
MR guidance by comparing frames before and after each operation. The
pre-operation frame includes virtual guiding objects, while the post-operation
frame contains physical counterparts. Existing approaches fall short of
accounting for the discrepancies between physical and virtual objects due to
imperfect 3D modeling or lighting estimation. In this paper, we propose EVER:
an edge-assisted auto-verification system for mobile MR-aided operations.
Unlike traditional frame-based similarity comparisons, EVER leverages the
segmentation model and rendering pipeline adapted to the unique attributes of
frames with physical pieces and those with their virtual counterparts; it
adopts a threshold-based strategy using Intersection over Union (IoU) metrics
for accurate auto-verification. To ensure fast auto-verification and low energy
consumption, EVER offloads compute-intensive tasks to an edge server. Through
comprehensive evaluations of public datasets and custom datasets with practical
implementation, EVER achieves over 90% verification accuracy within 100
milliseconds (significantly faster than average human reaction time of
approximately 273 milliseconds), while consuming only minimal additional
computational resources and energy compared to a system without
auto-verification.

Abstract: With the rapid proliferation of the Internet of Things, video analytics has
become a cornerstone application in wireless multimedia sensor networks. To
support such applications under bandwidth constraints, learning-based adaptive
quantization for video compression have demonstrated strong potential in

quality control at the macroblock level. How2Compress is a plug-and-play module
and can be seamlessly integrated into any existing edge video analytics
pipelines. We implement How2Compress on the H.264 codec and evaluate its
performance across diverse real-world scenarios. Experimental results show that
How2Compress achieves up to $50.4\%$ bitrate savings and outperforms baselines
by up to $3.01\times$ without compromising accuracy, demonstrating its
practical effectiveness and efficiency. Code is available at

Motivation: 现有短视频预加载方法存在两个关键问题：(1) 下载任务大小无法适应动态条件；(2) 观看时间预测模型难以在规模化部署中保持可靠性。这些问题影响了用户体验质量和带宽效率。

Method: 提出DeLoad框架，包含动态任务大小调整、多维度观看时间估计方法，以及基于深度强化学习的下载范围决策优化代理。

Result: 在离线测试平台上，DeLoad在QoE指标上实现了34.4%到87.4%的提升。在商业短视频平台部署后，用户总观看时间增加了0.09%，同时减少了卡顿事件和3.76%的带宽消耗。

Conclusion: DeLoad框架有效解决了短视频预加载中的关键挑战，在提升用户体验的同时优化了带宽使用效率，证明了其在真实商业环境中的实用价值。

Abstract: Short video streaming has become a dominant paradigm in digital media,
characterized by rapid swiping interactions and diverse media content. A key
technical challenge is designing an effective preloading strategy that
dynamically selects and prioritizes download tasks from an evolving playlist,
balancing Quality of Experience (QoE) and bandwidth efficiency under practical
commercial constraints. However, real world analysis reveals critical
limitations of existing approaches: (1) insufficient adaptation of download
task sizes to dynamic conditions, and (2) watch time prediction models that are
difficult to deploy reliably at scale. In this paper, we propose DeLoad, a
novel preloading framework that addresses these issues by introducing dynamic
task sizing and a practical, multi dimensional watch time estimation method.
Additionally, a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) enhanced agent is trained to
optimize the download range decisions adaptively. Extensive evaluations
conducted on an offline testing platform, leveraging massive real world network
data, demonstrate that DeLoad achieves significant improvements in QoE metrics
(34.4% to 87.4% gain). Furthermore, after deployment on a large scale
commercial short video platform, DeLoad has increased overall user watch time
by 0.09% while simultaneously reducing rebuffering events and 3.76% bandwidth
consumption.

TL;DR: PIRA是一个动态CDN资源选择算法，在短视频播放过程中实时优化用户体验质量和成本，通过控制理论方法平衡网络动态下的QoE与成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在大型短视频平台中，CDN资源选择对于维持用户体验质量同时控制流量成本至关重要。研究发现提供更高平均QoE的CDN往往成本更高，且连接质量在单个视频播放期间也会波动，这揭示了QoE与成本之间的动态权衡关系。

Method: PIRA通过数学建模将QoE和成本正式整合，采用视频内控制理论的CDN资源选择方法。为降低计算开销，使用状态空间剪枝和自适应参数调整来高效解决高维优化问题。

Result: 在涉及45万用户的两周大规模生产实验中，PIRA相比生产基线实现了2.1%的启动延迟降低、15.2%的重缓冲时间缩短和10%的平均单位流量成本降低。

Conclusion: PIRA在平衡用户体验和财务成本方面表现出色，证明了其在大规模短视频流媒体环境中动态优化CDN资源选择的有效性。

Abstract: In large scale short video platforms, CDN resource selection plays a critical
role in maintaining Quality of Experience (QoE) while controlling escalating
traffic costs. To better understand this phenomenon, we conduct in the wild
network measurements during video playback in a production short video system.
The results reveal that CDNs delivering higher average QoE often come at
greater financial cost, yet their connection quality fluctuates even within a
single video underscoring a fundamental and dynamic trade off between QoE and
cost. However, the problem of sustaining high QoE under cost constraints
remains insufficiently investigated in the context of CDN selection for short
video streaming. To address this, we propose PIRA, a dynamic resource selection
algorithm that optimizes QoE and cost in real time during video playback. PIRA
formally integrating QoE and cost by a mathematical model, and introduce a
intra video control theoretic CDN resource selection approach which can balance
QoE and cost under network dynamics. To reduce the computation overheads, PIRA
employs state space pruning and adaptive parameter adjustment to efficiently
solve the high dimensional optimization problem. In large scale production
experiments involving 450,000 users over two weeks, PIRA outperforms the
production baseline, achieving a 2.1% reduction in start up delay, 15.2%
shorter rebuffering time, and 10% lower average unit traffic cost,
demonstrating its effectiveness in balancing user experience and financial cost
at scale.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究在现实投票环境中，选民面临不同参与成本并使用启发式信念（而非标准投票计算模型）时，多数投票规则的有效性如何变化。

Method: 构建成本投票模型，选民在参与成本超过其关键性估计时弃权。分析不同关键性信念属性（弱消失和强消失）对均衡的影响。

Result: 弱消失关键性信念导致多个稳定均衡，选举接近平局；强消失关键性信念导致唯一均衡，只有零成本选民参与。存在一个尖锐阈值，低于该阈值时多数偏好的候选人以概率1获胜，高于该阈值时双方获胜概率相等。

Conclusion: 选民的关键性信念属性对选举结果有重要影响。弱消失关键性可能导致选举结果不稳定，而强消失关键性则导致参与率下降。多数投票规则的有效性取决于关键性信念的性质和成本分布。

Abstract: The well-known Condorcet Jury Theorem states that, under majority rule, the
better of two alternatives is chosen with probability approaching one as the
population grows. We study an asymmetric setting where voters face varying
participation costs and share a possibly heuristic belief about their
pivotality (ability to influence the outcome).
  In a costly voting setup where voters abstain if their participation cost is
greater than their pivotality estimate, we identify a single property of the
heuristic belief -- weakly vanishing pivotality -- that gives rise to multiple
stable equilibria in which elections are nearly tied. In contrast, strongly
vanishing pivotality (as in the standard Calculus of Voting model) yields a
unique, trivial equilibrium where only zero-cost voters participate as the
population grows. We then characterize when nontrivial equilibria satisfy a
version of the Jury Theorem: below a sharp threshold, the majority-preferred
candidate wins with probability approaching one; above it, both candidates
either win with equal probability.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩展经典上下文定价问题到更丰富的代理动作空间，研究在不知道代理真实成本或回报的情况下，委托方如何基于上下文信息和历史反馈提供合同。

Method: 通过上下文搜索框架，委托方重复与代理交互，基于d维上下文和历史反馈提供合同，而不了解代理的真实成本或回报。

Result: 建立了悲观Stackelberg遗憾的渐进紧指数界T^(1-Θ(1/d))，并证明经典Stackelberg遗憾的下界为Ω(T^(1/2-1/2d))，显示出与上下文定价问题的双指数难度分离。

Conclusion: 学习难度的显著增加源于上下文动作退化现象，即对抗性选择的上下文会使某些动作严格占优（因此不可激励），阻碍委托方探索或学习这些动作，从根本上限制学习进展。

Abstract: In this work, we introduce and study contextual search in general
principal-agent games, where a principal repeatedly interacts with agents by
offering contracts based on contextual information and historical feedback,
without knowing the agents' true costs or rewards. Our model generalizes
classical contextual pricing by accommodating richer agent action spaces. Over
$T$ rounds with $d$-dimensional contexts, we establish an asymptotically tight
exponential $T^{1 - \Theta(1/d)}$ bound in terms of the pessimistic Stackelberg
regret, benchmarked against the best utility for the principal that is
consistent with the observed feedback.
  We also establish a lower bound of $\Omega(T^{\frac{1}{2}-\frac{1}{2d}})$ on
the classic Stackelberg regret for principal-agent games, demonstrating a
surprising double-exponential hardness separation from the contextual pricing
problem (a.k.a, the principal-agent game with two actions), which is known to
admit a near-optimal $O(d\log\log T)$ regret bound [Kleinberg and Leighton,
2003, Leme and Schneider, 2018, Liu et al., 2021]. In particular, this
double-exponential hardness separation occurs even in the special case with
three actions and two-dimensional context. We identify that this significant
increase in learning difficulty arises from a structural phenomenon that we
call contextual action degeneracy, where adversarially chosen contexts can make
some actions strictly dominated (and hence unincentivizable), blocking the
principal's ability to explore or learn about them, and fundamentally limiting
learning progress.

Motivation: 虽然AJR是衡量多赢家选举公平性的重要公理，但并非所有选举实例都存在满足AJR的委员会。作者希望理解在随机选举模型下，AJR委员会存在的概率特性。

Method: 使用Erdős-Rényi随机图模型，每个选民以概率p独立地批准每个候选人。分析当候选人数m固定、选民数n趋于无穷时，AJR委员会存在性的概率行为。

Result: 发现了两个相变点p1和p2：当p<p1或p>p2时，AJR委员会以概率1存在；当p1<p<p2时，AJR委员会以概率0存在；在p=p1或p=p2时，存在概率既不趋近0也不趋近1。

Conclusion: 该研究为AJR公理在随机选举模型下的存在性提供了完整的概率刻画，揭示了参数p对AJR委员会存在性的关键影响，深化了对多赢家选举公平性的理解。

Abstract: We study the approval-based multi-winner election problem where $n$ voters
jointly decide a committee of $k$ winners from $m$ candidates. We focus on the
axiom \emph{average justified representation} (AJR) proposed by Fernandez,
Elkind, Lackner, Garcia, Arias-Fisteus, Basanta-Val, and Skowron (2017). AJR
postulates that every group of voters with a common preference should be
sufficiently represented in that their average satisfaction should be no less
than their Hare quota. Formally, for every group of
$\lceil\ell\cdot\frac{n}{k}\rceil$ voters with $\ell$ common approved
candidates, the average number of approved winners for this group should be at
least $\ell$. It is well-known that a winning committee satisfying AJR is not
guaranteed to exist for all multi-winner election instances. In this paper, we
study the likelihood of the existence of AJR under the Erd\H{o}s--R\'enyi
model. We consider the Erd\H{o}s--R\'enyi model parameterized by $p\in[0,1]$
that samples multi-winner election instances from the distribution where each
voter approves each candidate with probability $p$ (and the events that voters
approve candidates are independent), and we provide a clean and complete
characterization of the existence of AJR committees in the case where $m$ is a
constant and $n$ tends to infinity. We show that there are two phase transition
points $p_1$ and $p_2$ (with $p_1\leq p_2$) for the parameter $p$ such that: 1)
when $p<p_1$ or $p>p_2$, an AJR committee exists with probability $1-o(1)$, 2)
when $p_1<p<p_2$, an AJR committee exists with probability $o(1)$, and 3) when
$p=p_1$ or $p=p_2$, the probability that an AJR committee exists is bounded
away from both $0$ and $1$.

Motivation: 推荐系统研究在模型和评估方面取得进展，但忽视了研究过程本身的自动化。现有工具主要关注算法选择和超参数调优，缺乏端到端的自动化研究能力。

Method: 基于自动化科学的最新进展，提出AutoRecLab议程：构建结合LLM驱动构思和自动实验的原型；建立评估代理产生可复现发现的基准；创建AI生成论文的透明评审渠道；制定归因和可复现性标准；促进跨学科伦理对话。

Result: 该议程可提高研究吞吐量、发现非明显洞察，使推荐系统为新兴的人工研究智能做出贡献。

Conclusion: 呼吁组织社区研讨会，协调后续步骤并共同制定负责任集成自动化研究系统的指南。

Abstract: Recommender-systems research has accelerated model and evaluation advances,
yet largely neglects automating the research process itself. We argue for a
shift from narrow AutoRecSys tools -- focused on algorithm selection and
hyper-parameter tuning -- to an Autonomous Recommender-Systems Research Lab
(AutoRecLab) that integrates end-to-end automation: problem ideation,
literature analysis, experimental design and execution, result interpretation,
manuscript drafting, and provenance logging. Drawing on recent progress in
automated science (e.g., multi-agent AI Scientist and AI Co-Scientist systems),
we outline an agenda for the RecSys community: (1) build open AutoRecLab
prototypes that combine LLM-driven ideation and reporting with automated
experimentation; (2) establish benchmarks and competitions that evaluate agents
on producing reproducible RecSys findings with minimal human input; (3) create
review venues for transparently AI-generated submissions; (4) define standards
for attribution and reproducibility via detailed research logs and metadata;
and (5) foster interdisciplinary dialogue on ethics, governance, privacy, and
fairness in autonomous research. Advancing this agenda can increase research
throughput, surface non-obvious insights, and position RecSys to contribute to
emerging Artificial Research Intelligence. We conclude with a call to organise
a community retreat to coordinate next steps and co-author guidance for the
responsible integration of automated research systems.

*Yunjiang Jiang,Ayush Agarwal,Yang Liu,Bi Xue*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: LIME是一个新颖的推荐系统架构，通过低秩链接嵌入和线性注意力机制，将计算复杂度从二次降低到线性，实现10倍推理加速，同时保持与最先进transformer相当的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统transformer在推荐系统中面临计算成本随用户历史长度和候选集大小急剧增加的问题，限制了系统扩展性。

Method: 采用低秩链接嵌入预计算注意力权重，以及LIME-XOR线性注意力机制，分别解决候选集大小和用户序列长度的计算复杂度问题。

Result: 在公开和工业数据集上，LIME实现与SOTA transformer相近性能，同时在大候选集或长序列上获得10倍推理加速。在主要推荐平台上改善了用户参与度。

Conclusion: LIME为高效且表达能力强的推荐系统建立了新范式，解决了扩展推荐系统时的计算瓶颈问题。

Abstract: Scaling large recommendation systems requires advancing three major
frontiers: processing longer user histories, expanding candidate sets, and
increasing model capacity. While promising, transformers' computational cost
scales quadratically with the user sequence length and linearly with the number
of candidates. This trade-off makes it prohibitively expensive to expand
candidate sets or increase sequence length at inference, despite the
significant performance improvements.
  We introduce \textbf{LIME}, a novel architecture that resolves this
trade-off. Through two key innovations, LIME fundamentally reduces
computational complexity. First, low-rank ``link embeddings" enable
pre-computation of attention weights by decoupling user and candidate
interactions, making the inference cost nearly independent of candidate set
size. Second, a linear attention mechanism, \textbf{LIME-XOR}, reduces the
complexity with respect to user sequence length from quadratic ($O(N^2)$) to
linear ($O(N)$).
  Experiments on public and industrial datasets show LIME achieves near-parity
with state-of-the-art transformers but with a 10$\times$ inference speedup on
large candidate sets or long sequence lengths. When tested on a major
recommendation platform, LIME improved user engagement while maintaining
minimal inference costs with respect to candidate set size and user history
length, establishing a new paradigm for efficient and expressive recommendation
systems.

TL;DR: 开发了一个名为instaGuide的web应用，利用大语言模型自动总结Booking.com平台的用户评论，帮助用户快速获取关键信息并查询特定方面，显著缩短租房搜索时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着预订平台数据量激增，用户难以高效浏览住宿选项和分析评论。虽然平台提供基于星级、设施、价格的过滤功能，但最有价值的见解来自非结构化的文本评论，而逐条阅读这些评论耗时且效率低下。

Method: 开发instaGuide web应用，从Booking.com平台提取房产的文本评论，使用多种LLM模型进行评论总结和关键信息挖掘，支持用户查询房产的特定方面。评估了不同LLM模型在准确性、成本和响应质量方面的表现。

Result: LLM驱动的总结显著减少了用户寻找合适短租公寓所需的时间，改善了整体决策过程。通过评估多个LLM模型，找到了在准确性、成本和响应质量方面表现最佳的方案。

Conclusion: 大语言模型能够有效提升短租公寓推荐系统的效率，通过自动化评论总结和关键信息提取，为用户提供更快速、更精准的决策支持。

Abstract: The increasing number of data a booking platform such as Booking.com and
AirBnB offers make it challenging for interested parties to browse through the
available accommodations and analyze reviews in an efficient way. Efforts have
been made from the booking platform providers to utilize recommender systems in
an effort to enable the user to filter the results by factors such as stars,
amenities, cost but most valuable insights can be provided by the unstructured
text-based reviews. Going through these reviews one-by-one requires a
substantial amount of time to be devoted while a respectable percentage of the
reviews won't provide to the user what they are actually looking for.
  This research publication explores how Large Language Models (LLMs) can
enhance short rental apartments recommendations by summarizing and mining key
insights from user reviews. The web application presented in this paper, named
"instaGuide", automates the procedure of isolating the text-based user reviews
from a property on the Booking.com platform, synthesizing the summary of the
reviews, and enabling the user to query specific aspects of the property in an
effort to gain feedback on their personal questions/criteria.
  During the development of the instaGuide tool, numerous LLM models were
evaluated based on accuracy, cost, and response quality. The results suggest
that the LLM-powered summarization reduces significantly the amount of time the
users need to devote on their search for the right short rental apartment,
improving the overall decision-making procedure.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 本文对大型语言模型在移动应用推荐中的表现进行了实证分析，揭示了其推荐标准与传统应用商店优化指标的部分一致性，以及推荐一致性和对明确排名指令敏感度的变化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs越来越多地通过自然语言提示推荐移动应用，其推荐逻辑的不透明性引发了对其一致性、可解释性以及与ASO指标一致性的质疑。

Method: 通过构建16个通用排名标准的分类法，开发系统评估框架来分析推荐一致性和对明确排名指令的响应性，并提供可复现的研究包。

Result: 发现LLMs依赖广泛但碎片化的排名标准，仅部分与标准ASO指标一致。排名靠前的应用在不同运行中较为一致，但随着排名深度和搜索特异性增加，变异性增大。LLMs对明确排名指令的敏感度各不相同。

Conclusion: 研究结果旨在帮助终端用户、应用开发者和推荐系统研究者在对话式应用发现的新兴领域中导航，揭示了LLMs在对话式应用发现中的复杂推理动态。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used to recommend mobile
applications through natural language prompts, offering a flexible alternative
to keyword-based app store search. Yet, the reasoning behind these
recommendations remains opaque, raising questions about their consistency,
explainability, and alignment with traditional App Store Optimization (ASO)
metrics. In this paper, we present an empirical analysis of how widely-used
general purpose LLMs generate, justify, and rank mobile app recommendations.
Our contributions are: (i) a taxonomy of 16 generalizable ranking criteria
elicited from LLM outputs; (ii) a systematic evaluation framework to analyse
recommendation consistency and responsiveness to explicit ranking instructions;
and (iii) a replication package to support reproducibility and future research
on AI-based recommendation systems. Our findings reveal that LLMs rely on a
broad yet fragmented set of ranking criteria, only partially aligned with
standard ASO metrics. While top-ranked apps tend to be consistent across runs,
variability increases with ranking depth and search specificity. LLMs exhibit
varying sensitivity to explicit ranking instructions - ranging from substantial
adaptations to near-identical outputs - highlighting their complex reasoning
dynamics in conversational app discovery. Our results aim to support end-users,
app developers, and recommender-systems researchers in navigating the emerging
landscape of conversational app discovery.

TL;DR: PROSPER是一个利用大语言模型作为稀疏检索器的产品搜索框架，通过字面残差网络缓解幻觉问题，使用词汇聚焦窗口实现粗到细的稀疏化策略，在保持高效部署的同时显著提升召回率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 产品搜索中稀疏检索方法存在严重的词汇不匹配问题，导致性能不佳。大语言模型具有语义分析潜力，但直接应用会面临幻觉问题和训练初始化困难。

Method: 提出PROSPER框架：1）字面残差网络通过残差补偿机制强化被低估的字面术语；2）词汇聚焦窗口通过粗到细的稀疏化策略实现有效训练初始化。

Result: 离线和在线实验表明，PROSPER显著优于稀疏基线方法，召回性能可与先进的稠密检索器相媲美，并在线上实现了收入增长。

Conclusion: PROSPER成功解决了LLM在稀疏检索中的幻觉和训练挑战，为产品搜索提供了高效且高性能的解决方案。

Abstract: Product search is a crucial component of modern e-commerce platforms, with
billions of user queries every day. In product search systems, first-stage
retrieval should achieve high recall while ensuring efficient online
deployment. Sparse retrieval is particularly attractive in this context due to
its interpretability and storage efficiency. However, sparse retrieval methods
suffer from severe vocabulary mismatch issues, leading to suboptimal
performance in product search scenarios.With their potential for semantic
analysis, large language models (LLMs) offer a promising avenue for mitigating
vocabulary mismatch issues and thereby improving retrieval quality. Directly
applying LLMs to sparse retrieval in product search exposes two key
challenges:(1)Queries and product titles are typically short and highly
susceptible to LLM-induced hallucinations, such as generating irrelevant
expansion terms or underweighting critical literal terms like brand names and
model numbers;(2)The large vocabulary space of LLMs leads to difficulty in
initializing training effectively, making it challenging to learn meaningful
sparse representations in such ultra-high-dimensional spaces.To address these
challenges, we propose PROSPER, a framework for PROduct search leveraging LLMs
as SParsE Retrievers. PROSPER incorporates: (1)A literal residual network that
alleviates hallucination in lexical expansion by reinforcing underweighted
literal terms through a residual compensation mechanism; and (2)A lexical
focusing window that facilitates effective training initialization via a
coarse-to-fine sparsification strategy.Extensive offline and online experiments
show that PROSPER significantly outperforms sparse baselines and achieves
recall performance comparable to advanced dense retrievers, while also
achieving revenue increments online.

Abstract: The rapid integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into organizational
technology frameworks has transformed how organizations engage with AI-driven
models, influencing both operational performance and strategic innovation. With
the advent of foundation models, the importance of structured platforms for AI
model exchange has become paramount for organizational efficacy and
adaptability. However, a comprehensive framework to categorize and understand
these platforms remains underexplored. To address this gap, our taxonomy
provides a structured approach to categorize AI exchange platforms, examining
key dimensions and characteristics, as well as revealing interesting
interaction patterns between public research institutions and organizations:
Some platforms leverage peer review as a mechanism for quality control, and
provide mechanisms for online testing, deploying, and customization of models.
Our paper is beneficial to practitioners seeking to understand challenges and
opportunities that arise from AI exchange platforms. For academics, the
taxonomy serves as a foundation for further research into the evolution,
impact, and best practices associated with AI model sharing and utilization in
different contexts. Additionally, our study provides insights into the evolving
role of AI in various industries, highlighting the importance of adaptability
and innovation in platform design. This paper serves as a critical resource for
understanding the dynamic interplay between technology, business models, and
user engagement in the rapidly growing domain of AI model exchanges pointing
also towards possible future evolution.

Motivation: 随着大语言模型的发展，开发者可以通过与AI系统对话而非直接编写代码来生成软件，这促使了新的编程范式的出现。

Method: 提出了vibe coding的正式定义和参考架构，包括意图解析器、语义嵌入引擎、代理代码生成器和交互反馈循环。

Result: 描述了假设实现，比较了vibe coding与声明式、函数式和基于提示的编程，讨论了其对软件工程、人机协作和负责任AI实践的影响。

Conclusion: 分析了报告的生产力提升和民主化效应，同时指出了对齐、可重现性、偏见、可解释性、可维护性和安全性等关键挑战，并概述了未来研究方向。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models have enabled developers to generate
software by conversing with artificial intelligence systems rather than writing
code directly. This paper introduces vibe coding, an emerging AI-native
programming paradigm in which a developer specifies high-level functional
intent along with qualitative descriptors of the desired "vibe" (tone, style,
or emotional resonance). An intelligent agent then transforms those
specifications into executable software. We formalize the definition of vibe
coding and propose a reference architecture that includes an intent parser, a
semantic embedding engine, an agentic code generator, and an interactive
feedback loop. A hypothetical implementation is described. We compare vibe
coding with declarative, functional, and prompt-based programming, and we
discuss its implications for software engineering, human-AI collaboration, and
responsible AI practice. Finally, we examine reported productivity gains and
democratizing effects, review recent studies that highlight vulnerabilities and
potential slowdowns, identify key challenges such as alignment,
reproducibility, bias, explainability, maintainability, and security, and
outline future directions and open research questions.

Motivation: 智能合约作为在区块链平台上运行的软件模型，经常在其操作或规范中存在显著错误，这促使作者对相关工作进行系统研究。

Method: 通过调查分析已发表的相关文献，包括规范说明、验证工具和实验，然后提出基于描述逻辑的形式化验证方法。

Result: 研究识别了智能合约验证中的常见问题，并开发了一种基于描述逻辑的替代验证框架。

Conclusion: 基于描述逻辑的形式化验证方法为智能合约的验证提供了一种有效的替代方案，有助于提高智能合约的可靠性和安全性。

Abstract: Formal verification entails testing software to ensure it operates as
specified. Smart contracts are self-executing contracts with the terms of the
agreement directly written into lines of code. They run on blockchain platforms
and automatically enforce and execute the terms of an agreement when meeting
predefined conditions. However, Smart Contracts, as software models, often
contain notable errors in their operation or specifications. This observation
prompts us to conduct a focused study examining related works published across
various sources. These publications detail specifications, verification tools,
and relevant experiments. Subsequently, this survey proposes an alternative
formal verification based on description logic.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统编程基准测试依赖静态人工编写问题导致的数据污染和可扩展性限制问题。

Method: 利用LLM通过三种策略（单问题扩展、同类型融合、跨类型融合）系统化多样化问题，并采用结合暴力搜索和基于共识验证机制的测试用例合成管道。

Result: 构建了包含492个问题的基准测试，评估19个最先进LLM，表现最佳的o4-mini模型通过率仅为70.3%，证明UniCode具有高度挑战性和区分度。

Conclusion: UniCode为编码领域提供了可扩展且可靠的动态评估数据集生成解决方案。

Abstract: The reliance of competitive coding benchmarks on static, human-authored
problems creates significant challenges, including data contamination and
limited scalability. To address these issues, we introduce UniCode, a novel
framework that automatically generates high-quality algorithmic problems
alongside robust, contamination-resistant test cases. Inspired by biological
evolution that creates better and diverse offspring, our framework leverages
Large Language Models (LLMs) to systematically diversify problems through three
strategies: single problem extension, same-type fusion, and cross-type fusion.
A key innovation is our stress-driven test case synthesis pipeline, which
generates reliable test suites without requiring a canonical ground-truth
solution. This pipeline combines brute-force grounding for small-scale inputs
with a consensus-based validation mechanism for large-scale inputs to ensure
high correctness and coverage. We demonstrate effectiveness of our framework by
curating a benchmark of 492 problems and evaluating 19 state-of-the-art LLMs.
The results reveal that UniCode is highly challenging and discriminative, with
the top-performing model, o4-mini, achieving a pass rate of only 70.3%. Our
framework provides a scalable and reliable solution for generating dynamic
evaluation datasets in coding domain.

Motivation: 代理系统调用工具时经常因各种语法和语义原因失败，特别是那些只有在分析工具响应后才能识别和解决的语义错误，需要开发有效的错误修复机制。

Method: 结合LLM反思和领域特定RAG，使用描述特定工具和故障排除文档，开发后工具执行反思组件，专注于kubectl命令行工具管理Kubernetes的用例。

Result: RAG反思修复了kubectl命令，使55%的评估模型更可能成功执行，用户查询正确率平均提高36%，故障排除文档相比官方文档平均提高10%通过率。

Conclusion: 基于RAG的反思方法能有效修复工具调用中的语义错误，显著提高命令执行成功率和用户查询准确性，故障排除文档相比官方文档具有更好的修复效果。

Abstract: Agentic systems interact with external systems by calling tools such as
Python functions, REST API endpoints, or command line tools such as kubectl in
Kubernetes. These tool calls often fail for various syntactic and semantic
reasons. Some less obvious semantic errors can only be identified and resolved
after analyzing the tool's response. To repair these errors, we develop a
post-tool execution reflection component that combines large language model
(LLM)-based reflection with domain-specific retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG) using documents describing both the specific tool being called and
troubleshooting documents related to the tool. For this paper, we focus on the
use case of the kubectl command line tool to manage Kubernetes, a platform for
orchestrating cluster applications. Through a larger empirical study and a
smaller manual evaluation, we find that our RAG-based reflection will repair
kubectl commands such that they are both more likely to successfully execute
(pass rate) for 55% of our models evaluated and 36% more likely to correctly
answer the user query on average. We find that troubleshooting documents
improve pass rate compared to official documentation by an average of 10%.

Abstract: With the rapid evolution of large language models (LLMs), the demand for
automated, high-performance system kernels has emerged as a key enabler for
accelerating development and deployment. We introduce TritonRL, a
domain-specialized LLM for Triton kernel generation, trained with a novel
training framework that enables robust and automated kernel synthesis. Unlike
general-purpose programming languages, Triton kernel generation faces unique
challenges due to data scarcity and incomplete evaluation criteria, vulnerable
to reward hacking. Our approach addresses these challenges end-to-end by
distilling Triton-specific knowledge through supervised fine-tuning on curated
datasets, and further improving code quality via reinforcement learning (RL)
with robust, verifiable rewards and hierarchical reward assignment. Our RL
framework robustly detects reward hacking and guides both reasoning traces and
code tokens through fine-grained verification and hierarchical reward
decomposition, enabling the model to generate high-quality Triton kernels that
can truly replace existing modules. With robust and fine-grained evaluation,
our experiments on KernelBench demonstrate that TritonRL achieves
state-of-the-art correctness and speedup, surpassing all other Triton-specific
models and underscoring the effectiveness of our RL-based training paradigm.

Method: 采用系统文献综述方法，对2022-2024年间的31项研究进行分析，对基于GenAI的方法和工具进行分类，识别研究方法，并总结其有效性的实证评估。

Result: GenAI助手经常产生不准确或不清楚的解释，新手程序员在构建有效提示方面存在困难，这阻碍了他们利用GenAI辅助代码理解的能力。

Conclusion: 研究为计算教育工作者提供了基于证据的指导，指出了GenAI在促进代码理解方面的应用方向，并确定了未来研究的重点。

Abstract: The ability to comprehend code has long been recognized as an essential skill
in software engineering. As programmers lean more heavily on generative
artificial intelligence (GenAI) assistants to develop code solutions, it is
becoming increasingly important for programmers to comprehend GenAI solutions
so that they can verify their appropriateness and properly integrate them into
existing code. At the same time, GenAI tools are increasingly being enlisted to
provide programmers with tailored explanations of code written both by GenAI
and humans. Thus, in computing education, GenAI presents new challenges and
opportunities for learners who are trying to comprehend computer programs. To
provide computing educators with evidence-based guidance on the use of GenAI to
facilitate code comprehension and to identify directions for future research,
we present a systematic literature review (SLR) of state-of-the-art approaches
and tools that leverage GenAI to enhance code comprehension. Our SLR focuses on
31 studies published between 2022 and 2024. Despite their potential, GenAI
assistants often yield inaccurate or unclear explanations, and novice
programmers frequently struggle to craft effective prompts, thereby impeding
their ability to leverage GenAI to aid code comprehension. Our review
classifies GenAI-based approaches and tools, identifies methods used to study
them, and summarizes the empirical evaluations of their effectiveness. We
consider the implications of our findings for computing education research and
practice, and identify directions for future research.

TL;DR: SpecAgent通过索引时异步构建推测性上下文，在降低推理延迟的同时提升代码生成质量，相比基线方法获得9-11%的绝对性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在真实软件仓库中表现不佳，因为需要处理项目特定API和跨文件依赖。现有的检索增强方法在推理时注入上下文，但受限于延迟预算，要么影响检索质量，要么增加延迟影响用户体验。

Method: SpecAgent在索引阶段主动探索仓库文件，为每个文件构建推测性上下文，预测未来的编辑。这种索引时异步性允许充分计算上下文，同时推测性质提升代码生成质量。

Result: 实验显示SpecAgent相比最佳基线方法获得9-11%的绝对性能提升（48-58%相对提升），同时显著降低推理延迟。

Conclusion: SpecAgent通过索引时构建推测性上下文的方法，有效解决了代码生成中的延迟和质量权衡问题，并在无泄漏基准上验证了其优越性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at code-related tasks but often struggle
in realistic software repositories, where project-specific APIs and cross-file
dependencies are crucial. Retrieval-augmented methods mitigate this by
injecting repository context at inference time. The low inference-time latency
budget affects either retrieval quality or the added latency adversely impacts
user experience. We address this limitation with SpecAgent, an agent that
improves both latency and code-generation quality by proactively exploring
repository files during indexing and constructing speculative context that
anticipates future edits in each file. This indexing-time asynchrony allows
thorough context computation, masking latency, and the speculative nature of
the context improves code-generation quality. Additionally, we identify the
problem of future context leakage in existing benchmarks, which can inflate
reported performance. To address this, we construct a synthetic, leakage-free
benchmark that enables a more realistic evaluation of our agent against
baselines. Experiments show that SpecAgent consistently achieves absolute gains
of 9-11% (48-58% relative) compared to the best-performing baselines, while
significantly reducing inference latency.

Abstract: We introduce Chart2Code, a new benchmark for evaluating the chart
understanding and code generation capabilities of large multimodal models
(LMMs). Chart2Code is explicitly designed from a user-driven perspective,
capturing diverse real-world scenarios and progressively increasing task
difficulty. It consists of three levels: Level 1 (Chart Reproduction)
reproduces charts from a reference figure and user query; Level 2 (Chart
Editing) involves complex modifications such as changing chart types or adding
elements; and Level 3 (Long-Table to Chart Generation) requires models to
transform long, information-dense tables into faithful charts following user
instructions. To our knowledge, this is the first hierarchical benchmark that
reflects practical chart2code usage while systematically scaling task
complexity. In total, Chart2Code contains 2,023 tasks across 22 chart types,
paired with multi-level evaluation metrics that assess both code correctness
and the visual fidelity of rendered charts. We benchmark 25 state-of-the-art
(SoTA) LMMs, including both proprietary and the latest open-source models such
as GPT-5, Qwen2.5-VL, InternVL3/3.5, MiMo-VL, and Seed-1.6-VL. Experimental
results demonstrate that even the SoTA model GPT-5 averages only 0.57 on
code-based evaluation and 0.22 on chart-quality assessment across the editing
tasks, underscoring the difficulty of Chart2Code. We anticipate this benchmark
will drive advances in multimodal reasoning and foster the development of more
robust and general-purpose LMMs. Our code and data are available on Chart2Code.

Abstract: Jupyter notebooks are widely used for machine learning (ML) prototyping. Yet
few debugging tools are designed for ML code in notebooks, potentially due to
the lack of benchmarks. We introduce JunoBench, the first benchmark dataset of
real-world crashes in Python-based ML notebooks. JunoBench has 111 curated and
reproducible crashes from public Kaggle notebooks, each paired with a
verifiable fix, ranging over popular ML libraries, including TensorFlow/Keras,
PyTorch, Scikit-learn, Pandas, and NumPy, as well as notebook-specific

TL;DR: 提出了DIP-AI框架，专门用于指导AI创新项目的早期探索阶段，支持问题发现，旨在提高交付质量和利益相关者满意度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI系统的发展，需求工程活动在数据密集型范式中面临挑战，特别是在AI创新项目中缺乏问题发现的支持。

Method: 基于文献综述，结合ISO 12207、5338和设计思维元素，开发了DIP-AI发现框架，并通过产业-学术合作案例研究进行评估。

Result: 评估结果表明DIP-AI具有相关性和实用性，特别是在促进AI项目问题发现方面表现良好。

Conclusion: DIP-AI为AI问题发现提供了一个有效框架，对学术界和产业界都有重要贡献。

Abstract: Despite the increasing development of Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems,
Requirements Engineering (RE) activities face challenges in this new
data-intensive paradigm. We identified a lack of support for problem discovery
within AI innovation projects. To address this, we propose and evaluate DIP-AI,
a discovery framework tailored to guide early-stage exploration in such
initiatives. Based on a literature review, our solution proposal combines
elements of ISO 12207, 5338, and Design Thinking to support the discovery of AI
innovation projects, aiming at promoting higher quality deliveries and
stakeholder satisfaction. We evaluated DIP-AI in an industry-academia
collaboration (IAC) case study of an AI innovation project, in which
participants applied DIP-AI to the discovery phase in practice and provided
their perceptions about the approach's problem discovery capability,
acceptance, and suggestions. The results indicate that DIP-AI is relevant and
useful, particularly in facilitating problem discovery in AI projects. This
research contributes to academia by sharing DIP-AI as a framework for AI
problem discovery. For industry, we discuss the use of this framework in a real
IAC program that develops AI innovation projects.

TL;DR: 该论文构建了一个增强的非功能性需求数据集，并使用多种大语言模型进行NFR分类，其中Gemma-2和Phi-3表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手动识别非功能性需求耗时且易出错，需要自动化解决方案，而构建稳健全面的数据集是实现自动化的前提。

Method: 从项目章程和开源软件文档收集NFRs，增强现有数据集，使用RoBERTa、CodeBERT、Gemma-2、Phi-3、Mistral-8B和Llama-3.1-8B等LLMs进行分类，并评估精度、召回率、F1分数和lime分数。

Result: Gemma-2表现最佳，精度0.87、召回率0.89、F1分数0.88，lime命中分数78/80；Phi-3紧随其后，精度0.85、召回率0.87、F1分数0.86，lime命中分数79/80。

Conclusion: 通过改进上下文基础，增强了模型对技术方面和用户需求的理解，为NFR自动化识别提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs) play a critical role in determining the
overall quality and user satisfaction of software systems. Accurately
identifying and classifying NFRs is essential to ensure that software meets
performance, usability, and reliability expectations. However, manual
identification of NFRs from documentation is time-consuming and prone to
errors, necessitating automated solutions. Before implementing any automated
solution, a robust and comprehensive dataset is essential. To build such a
dataset, we collected NFRs from various Project Charters and Open Source
Software Documentation. This enhanced the technical depth and usability of an
already existing NFR dataset. We categorized NFRs into sub-classes and
identified needs using widely used Large Language Models to facilitate
automation. After classifying the NFRs, we compared the classification results
of the selected LLMs: RoBERTa, CodeBERT, Gemma-2, Phi-3, Mistral-8B, and
Llama-3.1-8B using various evaluation metrics, including precision, recall,
F1-score, and lime scores. Among these models, Gemma-2 achieved the best
results with a precision of 0.87, recall of 0.89, and F1-score of 0.88,
alongside a lime hit score of 78 out of 80. Phi-3 closely followed with a
precision of 0.85, recall of 0.87, F1-score of 0.86, and the highest lime hit
score of 79. By improving the contextual foundation, this integration enhanced
the model's comprehension of technical aspects and user requirements.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: BlueCodeAgent是一个端到端的蓝队代理，通过自动化红队生成多样化风险实例，利用这些实例通过宪法和代码分析来检测已见和未见风险场景，实现多层次防御。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型越来越多用于代码生成，安全风险担忧日益增长。早期研究主要关注红队测试，但蓝队防御进展有限，因为开发防御需要有效的语义理解来区分安全与不安全。

Method: 提出BlueCodeAgent框架，整合红队和蓝队：红队生成多样化风险实例，蓝队代理利用这些实例通过宪法和代码分析检测风险场景，采用动态分析减少误报。

Result: 在三个代表性代码相关任务（偏见指令检测、恶意指令检测、易受攻击代码检测）中，BlueCodeAgent相比基础模型和基于安全提示的防御取得了显著提升，在三个任务的四个数据集上平均F1分数提高了12.7%。

Conclusion: 红队测试通过持续识别新漏洞来增强防御性能，证明了红队对蓝队的益处。BlueCodeAgent能够总结可操作的宪法，增强上下文感知风险检测能力。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used for code generation,
concerns over the security risks have grown substantially. Early research has
primarily focused on red teaming, which aims to uncover and evaluate
vulnerabilities and risks of CodeGen models. However, progress on the blue
teaming side remains limited, as developing defense requires effective semantic
understanding to differentiate the unsafe from the safe. To fill in this gap,
we propose BlueCodeAgent, an end-to-end blue teaming agent enabled by automated
red teaming. Our framework integrates both sides: red teaming generates diverse
risky instances, while the blue teaming agent leverages these to detect
previously seen and unseen risk scenarios through constitution and code
analysis with agentic integration for multi-level defense. Our evaluation
across three representative code-related tasks--bias instruction detection,
malicious instruction detection, and vulnerable code detection--shows that
BlueCodeAgent achieves significant gains over the base models and safety
prompt-based defenses. In particular, for vulnerable code detection tasks,
BlueCodeAgent integrates dynamic analysis to effectively reduce false
positives, a challenging problem as base models tend to be over-conservative,
misclassifying safe code as unsafe. Overall, BlueCodeAgent achieves an average
12.7\% F1 score improvement across four datasets in three tasks, attributed to
its ability to summarize actionable constitutions that enhance context-aware
risk detection. We demonstrate that the red teaming benefits the blue teaming
by continuously identifying new vulnerabilities to enhance defense performance.

TL;DR: TestPrune是一种自动化技术，利用问题跟踪报告并战略性地重用回归测试来进行错误复现和补丁验证，通过最小化测试套件来提高LLM调试技术的效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实项目中的测试套件虽然覆盖率高但仍有不足，无法检测所有错误。回归测试除了确保功能保留外，还可用于调试当前版本，包括增强错误复现测试生成和验证补丁不回归现有功能。

Method: TestPrune自动最小化回归测试套件，生成小型高相关性的测试子集，可集成到任何代理错误修复流程中，正交提升整体性能。

Result: 在Otter框架中，TestPrune使问题复现率相对提高6.2%-9.0%；在Agentless框架中，问题解决率相对提高9.4%-12.9%。使用成本极低，每个SWE-Bench实例仅需$0.02-$0.05。

Conclusion: TestPrune通过战略性地重用回归测试，有效提高了错误复现和补丁验证的效率，且成本效益高，可集成到现有调试流程中。

Abstract: Test suites in real-world projects are often large and achieve high code
coverage, yet they remain insufficient for detecting all bugs. The abundance of
unresolved issues in open-source project trackers highlights this gap. While
regression tests are typically designed to ensure past functionality is
preserved in the new version, they can also serve a complementary purpose:
debugging the current version. Specifically, regression tests can (1) enhance
the generation of reproduction tests for newly reported issues, and (2)
validate that patches do not regress existing functionality. We present
TestPrune, a fully automated technique that leverages issue tracker reports and
strategically reuses regression tests for both bug reproduction and patch
validation.
  A key contribution of TestPrune is its ability to automatically minimize the
regression suite to a small, highly relevant subset of tests. Due to the
predominance of LLM-based debugging techniques, this minimization is essential
as large test suites exceed context limits, introduce noise, and inflate
inference costs. TestPrune can be plugged into any agentic bug repair pipeline
and orthogonally improve overall performance. As a proof of concept, we show
that TestPrune leads to a 6.2%-9.0% relative increase in issue reproduction
rate within the Otter framework and a 9.4% - 12.9% relative increase in issue
resolution rate within the Agentless framework on SWE-Bench Lite and SWE-Bench
Verified benchmarks, capturing fixes that were correctly produced by agents but
not submitted as final patches. Compared to the benefits, the cost overhead of
using TestPrune is minimal, i.e., \$0.02 and \$0.05 per SWE-Bench instance,
using GPT-4o and Claude-3.7-Sonnet models, respectively.

TL;DR: 提出了ML-On-Rails协议，一个增强生产环境中ML系统鲁棒性和可信度的统一框架，包含OOD检测、对抗攻击检测、输入验证和可解释性等安全措施。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统软件工程方法无法应对ML系统的静默故障、分布外数据和对抗攻击等挑战，需要专门针对ML组件的解决方案。

Method: 设计ML-On-Rails协议，集成多种安全防护机制，并使用HTTP状态码建立模型与软件间的通信框架，通过从业者调查验证方法有效性。

Result: 调查显示当前ML系统存在严重鲁棒性问题，ML-On-Rails协议能显著改善系统鲁棒性，工程师需要更多支持和资源。

Conclusion: ML-On-Rails协议为ML系统提供了标准化解决方案，未来需要基于调查和实际应用持续改进协议效果。

Abstract: Ensuring robustness in ML-enabled software systems requires addressing
critical challenges, such as silent failures, out-of-distribution (OOD) data,
and adversarial attacks. Traditional software engineering practices, which rely
on predefined logic, are insufficient for ML components that depend on data and
probabilistic decision-making. To address these challenges, we propose the
ML-On-Rails protocol, a unified framework designed to enhance the robustness
and trustworthiness of ML-enabled systems in production. This protocol
integrates key safeguards such as OOD detection, adversarial attack detection,
input validation, and explainability. It also includes a model-to-software
communication framework using HTTP status codes to enhance transparency in
reporting model outcomes and errors. To align our approach with real-world
challenges, we conducted a practitioner survey, which revealed major robustness
issues, gaps in current solutions, and highlighted how a standardised protocol
such as ML-On-Rails can improve system robustness. Our findings highlight the
need for more support and resources for engineers working with ML systems.
Finally, we outline future directions for refining the proposed protocol,
leveraging insights from the survey and real-world applications to continually
enhance its effectiveness.

TL;DR: InspectCoder是一个基于LLM的程序修复系统，通过交互式调试器控制实现动态分析，显著提升代码修复准确率和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM自修复方法主要依赖静态语义分析或表面执行日志，缺乏深入运行时行为分析，无法有效诊断复杂逻辑错误的根本原因。

Method: 采用双代理框架，通过交互式调试器控制实现策略性断点设置、目标状态检查和增量运行时实验，利用调试器反馈指导多步推理。

Result: 在两个挑战性自修复基准测试中，修复准确率相对提升5.10%-60.37%，bug修复效率提升1.67x-2.24x。

Conclusion: LLM驱动的动态分析在自动化软件工程中具有巨大潜力，InspectCoder将LLM调试从盲目试错转变为系统性根本原因诊断。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) frequently generate buggy code with complex
logic errors that are challenging to diagnose. While existing LLM-based
self-repair approaches conduct intensive static semantic analysis or reply on
superficial execution logs, they miss the in-depth runtime behaviors that often
expose bug root causes-lacking the interactive dynamic analysis capabilities
that make human debugging effective. We present InspectCoder, the first agentic
program repair system that empowers LLMs to actively conduct dynamic analysis
via interactive debugger control. Our dual-agent framework enables strategic
breakpoint placement, targeted state inspection, and incremental runtime
experimentation within stateful debugger sessions. Unlike existing methods that
follow fixed log collection procedures, InspectCoder adaptively inspects and
perturbs relevant intermediate states at runtime, and leverages immediate
process rewards from debugger feedback to guide multi-step reasoning,
transforming LLM debugging paradigm from blind trial-and-error into systematic
root cause diagnosis. We conduct comprehensive experiments on two challenging
self-repair benchmarks: BigCodeBench-R and LiveCodeBench-R. InspectCoder
achieves 5.10%-60.37% relative improvements in repair accuracy over the
strongest baseline, while delivering 1.67x-2.24x superior bug-fix efficiency
respectively. We also contribute InspectWare, an open-source middleware that
abstracts debugger complexities and maintains stateful debugging sessions
across mainstream Python testing frameworks. Our work provides actionable
insight into the interactive LLM-debugger systems, demonstrating the
significant potential of LLM-driven dynamic analysis for automated software
engineering.

TL;DR: 本研究通过三个案例研究分析了Kaggle获奖笔记本中人类编写与GenAI生成内容的差异，发现人类在文档详细度和结构多样性方面表现更优，而GenAI在代码质量方面更胜一筹。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着生成式AI技术的兴起，在竞争性环境中区分人类编写与GenAI生成内容变得日益重要，特别是在计算笔记本这种结合代码和文档的工具中。

Method: 通过分析25个代码和文档特征，比较人类编写的Kaggle获奖笔记本与GenAI生成笔记本的差异。

Result: 金牌得主主要通过更长更详细的文档区分；GenAI笔记本代码质量更高，但人类笔记本在结构多样性、复杂性和创新性方面表现更好。

Conclusion: 本研究为探索人类与AI在笔记本中的最大化协作潜力提供了基础，提出了四个进一步研究议程。

Abstract: Computational notebooks have become the preferred tool of choice for data
scientists and practitioners to perform analyses and share results. Notebooks
uniquely combine scripts with documentation. With the emergence of generative
AI (GenAI) technologies, it is increasingly important, especially in
competitive settings, to distinguish the characteristics of human-written
versus GenAI.
  In this study, we present three case studies to explore potential strengths
of both humans and GenAI through the coding and documenting activities in
notebooks. We first characterize differences between 25 code and documentation
features in human-written, medal-winning Kaggle notebooks. We find that gold
medalists are primarily distinguished by longer and more detailed
documentation. Second, we analyze the distinctions between human-written and
GenAI notebooks. Our results show that while GenAI notebooks tend to achieve
higher code quality (as measured by metrics like code smells and technical
debt), human-written notebooks display greater structural diversity,
complexity, and innovative approaches to problem-solving. Based on these
results, we envision the work as groundwork that highlight four agendas to
further investigate how GenAI could be utilized in notebooks that maximizes the
potential collaboration between human and AI.

TL;DR: 该研究对漏洞概念验证(PoC)进行了首次大规模分析，收集了47万多个PoC样本，评估了PoC报告的可用性、完整性和可复现性，发现78.9%的CVE漏洞缺乏可用PoC，现有PoC报告通常缺少30%的关键组件。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PoC对于验证漏洞存在、减少误报和展示安全威胁严重性至关重要，但相关研究远落后于漏洞数据研究，主要挑战包括PoC分散在不同平台、编写风格多样以及复现困难。

Method: 1) 从13个平台收集470,921个PoC及其报告；2) 提出结合模式匹配和BERT-NER模型的组件提取方法，从PoC报告中提取9个关键组件；3) 招募8名参与者手动复现150个采样漏洞，分析PoC可复现性。

Result: 研究发现78.9%的CVE漏洞缺乏可用PoC，现有PoC报告通常缺少约30%的必要组件，识别了使用可用PoC报告复现漏洞失败的各种原因。

Conclusion: 研究提出了利益相关者可采取的行动策略，以增强漏洞PoC在加强软件安全方面的整体可用性。

Abstract: The Proof-of-Concept (PoC) for a vulnerability is crucial in validating its
existence, mitigating false positives, and illustrating the severity of the
security threat it poses. However, research on PoCs significantly lags behind
studies focusing on vulnerability data. This discrepancy can be directly
attributed to several challenges, including the dispersion of real-world PoCs
across multiple platforms, the diversity in writing styles, and the difficulty
associated with PoC reproduction. To fill this gap, we conduct the first
large-scale study on PoCs in the wild, assessing their report availability,
completeness, reproducibility. Specifically, 1) to investigate PoC reports
availability for CVE vulnerability, we collected an extensive dataset of
470,921 PoCs and their reports from 13 platforms, representing the broadest
collection of publicly available PoCs to date. 2) To assess the completeness of
PoC report at a fine-grained level, we proposed a component extraction method,
which combines pattern-matching techniques with a fine-tuned BERT-NER model to
extract 9 key components from PoC reports. 3) To evaluate the effectiveness of
PoCs, we recruited 8 participants to manually reproduce 150 sampled
vulnerabilities with 32 vulnerability types based on PoC reports, enabling an
in-depth analysis of PoC reproducibility and the factors influencing it. Our
findings reveal that 78.9% of CVE vulnerabilities lack available PoCs, and
existing PoC reports typically miss about 30% of the essential components
required for effective vulnerability understanding and reproduction, with
various reasons identified for the failure to reproduce vulnerabilities using
available PoC reports. Finally, we proposed actionable strategies for
stakeholders to enhance the overall usability of vulnerability PoCs in
strengthening software security.

Motivation: 随着AI发展，LLM开始进入定性研究工作流，但缺乏将其整合到主题分析等成熟方法的可重复方法，且现有研究对LLM生成的定性输出缺乏系统性质量评估。

Method: 设计并迭代优化Braun和Clarke反思性主题分析第2-5阶段的提示词，使用15个软件工程师幸福感访谈数据，通过盲评让4位专家评估者应用质量标准对多个LLM输出与人工结果进行比较。

Result: 评估者61%的情况下更偏好LLM生成的代码，认为其对回答研究问题具有分析价值，但也发现LLM存在不必要的数据碎片化、遗漏潜在解释、主题边界不清等局限。

Conclusion: 提出了整合优化提示词与评估框架的可重复方法，提供了LLM与人工生成代码主题的实证比较，并制定了在保持方法严谨性的前提下将LLM整合到定性分析的指导原则。

Abstract: As artificial intelligence advances, large language models (LLMs) are
entering qualitative research workflows, yet no reproducible methods exist for
integrating them into established approaches like thematic analysis (TA), one
of the most common qualitative methods in software engineering research.
Moreover, existing studies lack systematic evaluation of LLM-generated
qualitative outputs against established quality criteria. We designed and
iteratively refined prompts for Phases 2-5 of Braun and Clarke's reflexive TA,
then tested outputs from multiple LLMs against codes and themes produced by
experienced researchers. Using 15 interviews on software engineers' well-being,
we conducted blind evaluations with four expert evaluators who applied rubrics
derived directly from Braun and Clarke's quality criteria. Evaluators preferred
LLM-generated codes 61% of the time, finding them analytically useful for
answering the research question. However, evaluators also identified
limitations: LLMs fragmented data unnecessarily, missed latent interpretations,
and sometimes produced themes with unclear boundaries. Our contributions are
threefold. First, a reproducible approach integrating refined, documented
prompts with an evaluation framework to operationalize Braun and Clarke's
reflexive TA. Second, an empirical comparison of LLM- and human-generated codes
and themes in software engineering data. Third, guidelines for integrating LLMs
into qualitative analysis while preserving methodological rigour, clarifying
when and how LLMs can assist effectively and when human interpretation remains
essential.

TL;DR: CodeRL+通过整合执行语义对齐到RLVR训练流程中，解决了LLM代码生成中文本模式与执行语义之间的语义鸿沟问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RLVR方法仅依赖测试用例的二元通过/失败信号，无法有效建立代码文本表示与执行语义之间的对齐，特别是对于代码中的细微逻辑错误。

Method: CodeRL+使模型能够推断变量级执行轨迹，提供执行语义的直接学习信号，可直接使用现有策略rollout并与各种RL算法无缝集成。

Result: CodeRL+在pass@1指标上实现了4.6%的平均相对提升，在代码推理和测试输出生成基准上分别获得15.5%和4.4%的更高准确率。

Conclusion: CodeRL+有效增强了代码文本表示与底层执行语义之间的对齐，在各种RL算法和LLM上表现出强大的适用性。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at code generation by learning from
vast code corpora, a fundamental semantic gap remains between their training on
textual patterns and the goal of functional correctness, which is governed by
formal execution semantics. Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards
(RLVR) approaches attempt to bridge this gap using outcome rewards from
executing test cases. However, solely relying on binary pass/fail signals is
inefficient for establishing a well-aligned connection between the textual
representation of code and its execution semantics, especially for subtle
logical errors within the code. In this paper, we propose CodeRL+, a novel
approach that integrates execution semantics alignment into the RLVR training
pipeline for code generation. CodeRL+ enables the model to infer variable-level
execution trajectory, providing a direct learning signal of execution
semantics. CodeRL+ can construct execution semantics alignment directly using
existing on-policy rollouts and integrates seamlessly with various RL
algorithms. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CodeRL+ outperforms
post-training baselines (including RLVR and Distillation), achieving a 4.6%
average relative improvement in pass@1. CodeRL+ generalizes effectively to
other coding tasks, yielding 15.5% and 4.4% higher accuracy on code-reasoning
and test-output-generation benchmarks, respectively. CodeRL+ shows strong
applicability across diverse RL algorithms and LLMs. Furthermore, probe
analyses provide compelling evidence that CodeRL+ strengthens the alignment
between code's textual representations and its underlying execution semantics.

Abstract: In this study, we present a solution for the modernization of legacy
applications, an area of code generation where LLM-based multi-agent systems
are proving essential for complex multi-phased tasks. Legacy applications often
contain deprecated components that create compatibility, security, and
reliability risks, but high resource costs make companies hesitate to update.
We take a step forward to integrate an LLM-based multi-agent system as part of
a legacy web application update to provide a cost-effective solution to update
legacy applications autonomously. We propose a multi-agent system named a
Verifying Agent Pipeline Updater (VAPU), which is designed to update code files
in phases while simulating different roles in a software development team. In
our previous study, we evaluated the system for legacy version updates by using
six legacy web application view files by resulting errors and accomplished
requirements. This study extends the previous evaluation of a multi-agent
pipeline system by extending the evaluation of VAPU from a single LLM to five
LLMs and using the temperature parameter in both 0 to 1 settings. Additionally,
we tested the system with 20 open-source Python GitHub projects. The results of
the evaluation were compared to Zero-Shot Learning (ZSL) and One-Shot Learning
(OSL) prompts. The extended evaluation of VAPU showed that particularly in a
low-temperature VAPU can get similar level of error count compared to the
ZSL/OSL prompts but with a higher level of fulfilled requirements, depending on
the LLM. VAPU showed up to 22.5% increase in the succeeding Python file update
requirements compared to ZSL/OSL prompts. The study indicates that an LLM-based
multi-agent system is a capable solution to update components of a legacy
application autonomously.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 提出了一种考虑服务状态的服务建模方法，通过分析交互消息的上下文依赖关系来提高服务响应生成的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 企业软件系统日益集成多样化服务，测试这些高度互联系统面临挑战。现有服务虚拟化方法大多忽略了服务状态，导致服务仿真准确性不足，测试环境不够真实。

Method: 从服务交互中推导服务模型，通过揭示交互消息间的上下文依赖关系和分析消息数据值之间的关系，来考虑服务状态。

Result: 使用有状态和无状态服务的交互轨迹进行评估，结果显示在服务响应生成方面比现有方法在准确性和效率上都有显著提升。

Conclusion: 考虑服务状态的服务建模方法能够有效提高服务响应生成的准确性和测试环境的真实性，特别适用于有状态服务的测试场景。

Abstract: Enterprise software systems are increasingly integrating with diverse
services to meet expanding business demands. Testing these highly
interconnected systems presents a challenge due to the need for access to the
connected services. Service virtualization has emerged as a widely used
technique to derive service models from recorded interactions, for service
response generation during system testing. Various methods have been proposed
to emulate actual service behavior based on these interactions, but most fail
to account for the service's state, which reduces the accuracy of service
emulation and the realism of the testing environment, especially when dealing
with stateful services. This paper proposes an approach to deriving service
models from service interactions, which enhance the accuracy of response
generation by considering service state. This is achieved by uncovering
contextual dependencies among interaction messages and analyzing the
relationships between message data values. The approach is evaluated using
interaction traces collected from both stateful and stateless services, and the
results reveal notable enhancements in accuracy and efficiency over existing
approaches in service response generation.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 提出了一个演示器需求细化框架，通过定义5个层次化的演示级别来解决研究项目中演示器覆盖范围不明确的问题，帮助评估演示可行性并调整目标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究项目中演示器主题存在不确定性，项目提案阶段对演示器覆盖范围的详细阐述往往不足，导致目标与可实现的演示结果不匹配，阻碍项目进展。TRL量表作为松散描述符也无济于事。

Method: 定义5个层次化的演示级别，明确与期望（如工作包交互）和项目工业用例相关联。框架旨在评估目标演示的可行性、进行现实调整并协助描述需求。

Result: 在软件密集型系统和工业信息物理系统领域的两个研究项目中应用该框架（一个在早期阶段，一个在最终阶段），证明了其有效性。由于需要4-5年时间观察完整结果，完整验证尚不可得。

Conclusion: 提出的演示器需求细化框架能够有效解决研究项目中演示器覆盖范围不明确的问题，帮助项目团队更清晰地定义和调整演示目标。

Abstract: One of the challenges apparent in the organisation of research projects is
the uncertainties around the subject of demonstrators. A precise and detailed
elicitation of the coverage for project demonstrators is often an afterthought
and not sufficiently detailed during proposal writing. This practice leads to
continuous confusion and a mismatch between targeted and achievable
demonstration of results, hindering progress. The reliance on the TRL scale as
a loose descriptor does not help either. We propose a demonstrator requirements
elaboration framework aiming to evaluate the feasibility of targeted
demonstrations, making realistic adjustments, and assist in describing
requirements. In doing so, we define 5 hierarchical levels of demonstration,
clearly connected to expectations, e.g., work package interaction, and also
connected to the project's industrial use-cases. The considered application
scope in this paper is the domain of software-intensive systems and industrial
cyber-physical systems. A complete validation is not accessible, as it would
require application of our framework at the start of a project and observing
the results at the end, taking 4-5 years. Nonetheless, we have applied it to
two research projects from our portfolio, one at the early and another at the
final stages, revealing its effectiveness.

### [202] [When Abstraction Breaks Physics: Rethinking Modular Design in Quantum Software](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18557)
*Jianjun Zhao*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 本文识别了量子软件工程中的基本冲突：语法有效的抽象实践可能违反量子计算的物理约束。提出了三类失败案例和物理健全抽象机制的设计原则，以及量子特定类型系统、效果注释和基于合约的模块设计等研究方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 经典软件工程中的抽象原则（模块化、可重用性、可扩展性）在量子程序中面临挑战，因为量子语义（幺正性、纠缠、不可克隆定理、测量的破坏性）与经典抽象机制存在根本冲突。

Method: 识别三类抽象失败案例，分析量子语义违反问题，提出物理健全抽象机制的设计原则，并建议量子特定类型系统、效果注释和基于合约的模块设计等研究方向。

Result: 揭示了量子软件工程中抽象实践与量子物理约束之间的根本冲突，为开发量子安全的抽象机制提供了理论基础和设计指导。

Conclusion: 需要基于量子语义和工程可扩展性，系统性地重新思考量子软件工程中的抽象概念，开发量子特定的抽象机制以确保程序的物理正确性。

Abstract: Abstraction is a fundamental principle in classical software engineering,
which enables modularity, reusability, and scalability. However, quantum
programs adhere to fundamentally different semantics, such as unitarity,
entanglement, the no-cloning theorem, and the destructive nature of
measurement, which introduce challenges to the safe use of classical
abstraction mechanisms. This paper identifies a fundamental conflict in quantum
software engineering: abstraction practices that are syntactically valid may
violate the physical constraints of quantum computation. We present three
classes of failure cases where naive abstraction breaks quantum semantics and
propose a set of design principles for physically sound abstraction mechanisms.
We further propose research directions, including quantum-specific type
systems, effect annotations, and contract-based module design. Our goal is to
initiate a systematic rethinking of abstraction in quantum software
engineering, based on quantum semantics and considering engineering
scalability.

TL;DR: WebDevJudge是一个系统性基准测试，用于评估LLM作为评判者在网页开发任务中的表现，揭示了LLM评判者与人类专家之间存在显著差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的LLM-as-a-judge范式在定义明确的任务上表现良好，但在动态环境和复杂交互的开放式任务中的可靠性尚未探索。

Method: 构建了包含人类偏好标签的WebDevJudge基准测试，支持基于静态观察的非交互式评估和与动态网页环境的连续交互式评估，使用结构化、基于查询的评分标准确保高质量真实标签。

Result: 实验显示LLM评判者与人类专家之间存在显著差距，这种差距源于模型的基本限制，包括识别功能等价性失败、验证任务可行性失败和减轻偏见失败。

Conclusion: WebDevJudge对LLM-as-a-judge范式提出了重大挑战，为未来开发更可靠、更有能力的复杂场景自动评估器提供了指导方向。

Abstract: The paradigm of LLM-as-a-judge is emerging as a scalable and efficient
alternative to human evaluation, demonstrating strong performance on
well-defined tasks. However, its reliability in open-ended tasks with dynamic
environments and complex interactions remains unexplored. To bridge the gap, we
introduce WebDevJudge, a systematic benchmark for assessing LLM-as-a-judge
performance in web development, with support for both non-interactive
evaluation based on static observations and continuous interactive evaluation
with a dynamic web environment. WebDevJudge comprises human preference labels
over paired web implementations, annotated with structured and query-grounded
rubrics to ensure high-quality ground truth. Using this benchmark, we
comprehensively evaluate various evaluators, including LLMs, MLLMs, and agentic
workflows. We systematically investigate the impact of different paradigms and
guidance mechanisms. Our experiments reveal a significant gap between LLM
judges and human experts. In-depth analysis indicates this gap stems from
fundamental model limitations, including failures in recognizing functional
equivalence, verifying task feasibility, and mitigating bias. Overall,
WebDevJudge presents a significant challenge to LLM-as-a-judge, offering
insights to guide future research toward developing more reliable and capable
automated evaluators for complicated scenarios. Code and data are available at

Motivation: 低代码开发平台的快速普及需要系统化的评估方法，以解决营销驱动的平台比较与严谨的、特定情境评估方法之间的差距。

Method: 基于五个关键标准（业务流程编排、UI/UX定制、集成与互操作性、治理与安全、AI增强自动化）构建评估框架，采用加权评分模型进行定量评估。

Result: 通过企业环境中的实证验证，证明该结构化方法能显著改善决策结果，降低平台锁定或解决方案选择不当的风险。

Conclusion: 该评估框架为组织提供了系统化的低代码平台选择方法，填补了现有评估方法的空白，有助于做出更明智的决策。

Abstract: The rapid adoption of Low-Code Development Platforms (LCDPs) has created a
critical need for systematic evaluation methodologies that enable organizations
to make informed platform selection decisions. This paper presents a
comprehensive evaluation framework based on five key criteria: Business Process
Orchestration, UI/UX Customization, Integration and Interoperability,
Governance and Security, and AI-Enhanced Automation. We propose a weighted
scoring model that allows organizations to quantitatively assess and compare
different low-code platforms based on their specific requirements and strategic
priorities. The framework addresses the gap between marketing-driven platform
comparisons and rigorous, context-specific evaluation methodologies. Through
empirical validation in enterprise environments, we demonstrate how this
structured approach can significantly improve decision-making outcomes and
reduce the risk of platform lock-in or inadequate solution selection.

TL;DR: 提出了CUARewardBench，首个用于评估计算机使用代理（CUA）奖励模型的基准，包含结果奖励模型（ORM）和过程奖励模型（PRM）的评估，并提出了UPE集成方法显著提升评估可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有基于脚本的验证器在CUA评估中扩展性有限且无法提供逐步评估的问题，探索奖励模型在CUA评估中的有效性。

Method: 构建包含10个软件类别和7种代理架构轨迹的基准数据集，通过专家标注确保质量，并提出UPE集成方法使用严格一致投票和策略提示模板配置。

Result: 揭示了当前CUA奖励模型的关键局限性，包括视觉推理能力不足和知识缺陷。UPE方法在ORM上达到89.8%精确度和93.3% NPV，在PRM上达到81.7%精确度和85.1% NPV。

Conclusion: CUARewardBench为CUA奖励模型评估提供了系统基准，UPE方法显著提升了评估可靠性，发现通用视觉语言模型在奖励评估中优于专门的CUA模型。

Abstract: Computer-using agents (CUAs) enable task completion through natural
interaction with operating systems and software interfaces. While script-based
verifiers are widely adopted for evaluation, they suffer from limited
scalability and inability to provide step-wise assessment. Reward models offer
promising alternatives, but their effectiveness on CUA evaluation remains
largely underexplored. To address this gap, we present CUARewardBench,
comprising four key contributions: (1) First-ever Comprehensive CUA Reward
Benchmark: We introduce the first benchmark for evaluating both outcome reward
models (ORM) and process reward models (PRM) on CUA tasks, enabling systematic
assessment across trajectory-level and step-level evaluation. (2) Diverse,
Practical and Reliable Dataset: CUARewardBench encompasses trajectories from 10
software categories and 7 agent architectures with varying performance levels
(25.9%-50.8% success rates). All trajectories are expertly annotated through
carefully designed protocols, with rigorous quality control to ensure
reliability and practical applicability. (3) Comprehensive Analysis and
Insights: Through extensive experiments across 7 vision-language models and 3
prompt templates, we reveal critical limitations of current CUA RMs, including
insufficient visual reasoning capabilities, knowledge deficiencies, and the
superiority of general VLMs over specialized CUA models for reward evaluation.
(4) Unanimous Prompt Ensemble (UPE): Based on the insights from our
comprehensive analysis, we propose UPE, a novel ensemble method that
significantly enhances reward model reliability through strict unanimous voting
and strategic prompt-template configurations. UPE achieves 89.8% precision and
93.3% NPV for ORM, and 81.7% precision and 85.1% NPV for PRM, substantially
outperforming single VLMs and traditional ensemble approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统资金和合同方法的线性、刚性特点与敏捷开发的灵活迭代原则存在冲突，阻碍客户-承包商有效协作并限制盈利能力。

Method: 在SCOPUS、Web of Science和Google Scholar中进行了系统文献综述，识别了来自私人和公共部门的38项相关实证研究。

Result: 识别出4种替代资金方法和4种替代合同方法，采用这些方法能带来更高客户满意度、降低承包商风险、提高资源利用效率等益处。

Conclusion: 替代性资金和合同方法能促进敏捷项目的灵活性和效率，但也带来文化结构挑战、范围蔓延风险等，建议组织从混合方法开始逐步过渡。

Abstract: Agile software development emphasizes flexibility and iterative processes,
which may conflict with the more linear, rigid, and time-consuming traditional
funding and contracting approaches. This review synthesizes real-life
experiences of using alternative (non-traditional) contracting and funding
approaches. The focus is on identifying approaches that align better with agile
principles and understanding the motivations, benefits, and challenges these
alternatives present. A systematic literature review was conducted in SCOPUS,
Web of Science, and Google Scholar, where we identified 38 relevant
peer-reviewed empirical studies from private and public sector contexts. Four
alternative funding and four alternative contracting approaches were
identified. Organizations were motivated to adopt these alternative approaches
because traditional approaches often proved too rigid, conflicted with agile
principles, hindered effective client-contractor collaboration, and limited
profitability. The benefits of these alternatives included higher client
satisfaction, reduced contractor risk, and more efficient resource utilization.
Adopting alternative funding and contracting approaches may promote flexibility
and efficiency in agile projects but also presents cultural and structural
challenges, increases the risk of scope creep and analysis paralysis, and
requires additional effort in terms of time and resources. The context of the
organization matters highly in selecting a suitable approach, such as the
organizational readiness in terms of its leaders, people, and systems. Thus,
instead of wholly adopting alternative approaches and introducing changes
abruptly, organizations may benefit from starting with hybrid approaches that
balance flexibility and control and progressively transition to fully flexible
approaches tailored to their needs

TL;DR: CausalFT是一个基于因果推断的公平性测试框架，通过识别与敏感特征因果相关的非敏感特征来指导样本扰动，显著提高了现有测试生成器发现公平性缺陷的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有公平性测试方法主要关注测试样本生成器的设计，忽略了数据特征的因果知识，限制了其发现公平性缺陷的潜力。

Method: 通过因果推断提取与敏感特征直接因果相关的非敏感特征，并将这种因果关系注入到扰动过程中来指导测试样本生成。

Result: 在1296个测试案例中，CausalFT在93%的情况下显著提升了基础生成器发现公平性缺陷的能力，在64%的情况下优于基于相关性排序的方法，且运行效率更高。

Conclusion: CausalFT是一个通用的高层次框架，能够与多种基础生成器结合，有效提升公平性测试的效果和效率。

Abstract: To mitigate unfair and unethical discrimination over sensitive features
(e.g., gender, age, or race), fairness testing plays an integral role in
engineering systems that leverage AI models to handle tabular data. A key
challenge therein is how to effectively reveal fairness bugs under an
intractable sample size using perturbation. Much current work has been focusing
on designing the test sample generators, ignoring the valuable knowledge about
data characteristics that can help guide the perturbation and hence limiting
their full potential. In this paper, we seek to bridge such a gap by proposing
a generic framework of causally perturbed fairness testing, dubbed CausalFT.
Through causal inference, the key idea of CausalFT is to extract the most
directly and causally relevant non-sensitive feature to its sensitive
counterpart, which can jointly influence the prediction of the label. Such a
causal relationship is then seamlessly injected into the perturbation to guide
a test sample generator. Unlike existing generator-level work, CausalFT serves
as a higher-level framework that can be paired with diverse base generators.
Extensive experiments on 1296 cases confirm that CausalFT can considerably
improve arbitrary base generators in revealing fairness bugs over 93% of the
cases with acceptable extra runtime overhead. Compared with a state-of-the-art
approach that ranks the non-sensitive features solely based on correlation,
CausalFT performs significantly better on 64% cases while being much more
efficient. Further, CausalFT can better improve bias resilience in nearly all
cases.

Motivation: 需求工程领域数据稀缺，现有LLM4RE数据集分散且缺乏系统表征，限制了重用和可比性。

Method: 通过系统映射研究，分析43篇主要研究中引用的62个公开数据集，按工件类型、粒度、RE阶段、任务、领域和语言等描述符进行表征。

Result: 发现多个研究空白：需求获取任务覆盖有限、除可追溯性外的管理活动数据集稀缺、多语言可用性不足。

Conclusion: 提供了公开目录和结构化表征方案，支持LLM4RE研究中的数据集选择、比较和重用。

Abstract: [Context] Large Language Models (LLMs) rely on domain-specific datasets to
achieve robust performance across training and inference stages. However, in
Requirements Engineering (RE), data scarcity remains a persistent limitation
reported in surveys and mapping studies. [Question/Problem] Although there are
multiple datasets supporting LLM-based RE tasks (LLM4RE), they are fragmented
and poorly characterized, limiting reuse and comparability. This research
addresses the limited visibility and characterization of datasets used in
LLM4RE. We investigate which public datasets are employed, how they can be
systematically characterized, and which RE tasks and dataset descriptors remain
under-represented. [Ideas/Results] To address this, we conduct a systematic
mapping study to identify and analyse datasets used in LLM4RE research. A total
of 62 publicly available datasets are referenced across 43 primary studies.
Each dataset is characterized along descriptors such as artifact type,
granularity, RE stage, task, domain, and language. Preliminary findings show
multiple research gaps, including limited coverage for elicitation tasks,
scarce datasets for management activities beyond traceability, and limited
multilingual availability. [Contribution] This research preview offers a public
catalogue and structured characterization scheme to support dataset selection,
comparison, and reuse in LLM4RE research. Future work will extend the scope to
grey literature, as well as integration with open dataset and benchmark
repositories.

Motivation: 现有方法难以将嘈杂、模糊的用户反馈转化为可解释的见解，缺乏语义深度和结构化组织，限制了需求分析和跨应用比较。

Method: 结合句法解析与LLM增强，通过层次聚类和自动调优组织特征，并自动生成有意义的分类标签。

Result: 在公共基准测试中验证了提取正确性，在生成式AI助手应用评论样本中评估了聚类质量、语义一致性和可解释性。

Conclusion: FeClustRE提供了一个混合特征提取和分类法生成的框架，通过自动调优机制和开源实现，连接用户反馈与特征理解，为需求工程提供更深入的洞察。

Abstract: [Context and motivation.] Extracting features from mobile app reviews is
increasingly important for multiple requirements engineering (RE) tasks.
However, existing methods struggle to turn noisy, ambiguous feedback into
interpretable insights. [Question/problem.] Syntactic approaches lack semantic
depth, while large language models (LLMs) often miss fine-grained features or
fail to structure them coherently. In addition, existing methods output flat
lists of features without semantic organization, limiting interpretation and
comparability. Consequently, current feature extraction approaches do not
provide structured, meaningful representations of app features. As a result,
practitioners face fragmented information that hinder requirement analysis,
prioritization, and cross-app comparison, among other use cases. [Principal
ideas/results.] In this context, we propose FeClustRE, a framework integrating
hybrid feature extraction, hierarchical clustering with auto-tuning and
LLM-based semantic labelling. FeClustRE combines syntactic parsing with LLM
enrichment, organizes features into clusters, and automatically generates
meaningful taxonomy labels. We evaluate FeClustRE on public benchmarks for
extraction correctness and on a sample study of generative AI assistant app
reviews for clustering quality, semantic coherence, and interpretability.
[Contribution.] Overall, FeClustRE delivers (1) a hybrid framework for feature
extraction and taxonomy generation, (2) an auto-tuning mechanism with a
comprehensive evaluation methodology, and (3) open-source and replicable
implementation. These contributions bridge user feedback and feature
understanding, enabling deeper insights into current and emerging requirements.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 移动应用验收测试在现代软件开发中仍然是瓶颈，特别是在使用Flutter等跨平台框架时。虽然开发者越来越依赖自动化测试工具，但创建和维护验收测试工件仍需要大量人工工作。

Method: 引入AToMIC框架，利用专门的大型语言模型从需求（JIRA工单）和最近的代码变更中自动生成Gherkin场景、页面对象和可执行的UI测试脚本。

Result: 在宝马MyBMW应用上测试，覆盖13个真实问题，在170+屏幕的代码库中，AToMIC在标准硬件上每个功能在5分钟内生成可执行测试工件。生成质量高：93.3%的Gherkin场景生成时语法正确，78.8%的页面对象无需手动编辑即可运行，100%生成的UI测试成功执行。

Conclusion: AToMIC是一个可扩展、实用的解决方案，可用于简化工业移动项目中验收测试的创建和维护，所有实践者都报告了时间节省（通常每个功能节省一个完整的开发日）并对此方法有强烈信心。

Abstract: Mobile acceptance testing remains a bottleneck in modern software
development, particularly for cross-platform mobile development using
frameworks like Flutter. While developers increasingly rely on automated
testing tools, creating and maintaining acceptance test artifacts still demands
significant manual effort. To help tackle this issue, we introduce AToMIC, an
automated framework leveraging specialized Large Language Models to generate
Gherkin scenarios, Page Objects, and executable UI test scripts directly from
requirements (JIRA tickets) and recent code changes. Applied to BMW's MyBMW
app, covering 13 real-world issues in a 170+ screen codebase, AToMIC produced
executable test artifacts in under five minutes per feature on standard
hardware. The generated artifacts were of high quality: 93.3% of Gherkin
scenarios were syntactically correct upon generation, 78.8% of PageObjects ran
without manual edits, and 100% of generated UI tests executed successfully. In
a survey, all practitioners reported time savings (often a full developer-day
per feature) and strong confidence in adopting the approach. These results
confirm AToMIC as a scalable, practical solution for streamlining acceptance
test creation and maintenance in industrial mobile projects.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有大语言模型在代码翻译中准确性与推理延迟之间的权衡问题，满足实际开发工作流中需要人工检查的需求。

Method: 1) 使用DeepSeek-R1构建高质量的推理增强数据集(源代码、推理过程、目标代码三元组)；2) 两阶段训练：监督微调+强化学习。

Result: 在6个翻译对上，翻译准确性显著提升(CA最高+49.2%，CodeBLEU最高+27.8%)，同时减少生成token数(最高-19.3%)和降低推理延迟(最高-29.0%)。

Conclusion: EffiReasonTrans框架有效平衡了代码翻译的准确性与效率，并在基于代理的框架中表现出更好的翻译准确性。

Abstract: Code translation is a crucial task in software development and maintenance.
While recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have improved
automated code translation accuracy, these gains often come at the cost of
increased inference latency, hindering real-world development workflows that
involve human-in-the-loop inspection. To address this trade-off, we propose
EffiReasonTrans, a training framework designed to improve translation accuracy
while balancing inference latency. We first construct a high-quality
reasoning-augmented dataset by prompting a stronger language model,
DeepSeek-R1, to generate intermediate reasoning and target translations. Each
(source code, reasoning, target code) triplet undergoes automated syntax and
functionality checks to ensure reliability. Based on this dataset, we employ a
two-stage training strategy: supervised fine-tuning on reasoning-augmented
samples, followed by reinforcement learning to further enhance accuracy and
balance inference latency. We evaluate EffiReasonTrans on six translation
pairs. Experimental results show that it consistently improves translation
accuracy (up to +49.2% CA and +27.8% CodeBLEU compared to the base model) while
reducing the number of generated tokens (up to -19.3%) and lowering inference
latency in most cases (up to -29.0%). Ablation studies further confirm the
complementary benefits of the two-stage training framework. Additionally,
EffiReasonTrans demonstrates improved translation accuracy when integrated into
agent-based frameworks. Our code and data are available at
https://github.com/DeepSoftwareAnalytics/EffiReasonTrans.

Conclusion: PRISM模型通过理论证明在温和条件下诱导的时域动态收缩，并推导了图模块的Lipschitz边界，解释了模型的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Long-horizon multivariate time-series forecasting is challenging because
realistic predictions must (i) denoise heterogeneous signals, (ii) track
time-varying cross-series dependencies, and (iii) remain stable and physically
plausible over long rollout horizons. We present PRISM, which couples a
score-based diffusion preconditioner with a dynamic, correlation-thresholded
graph encoder and a forecast head regularized by generic physics penalties. We
prove contraction of the induced horizon dynamics under mild conditions and
derive Lipschitz bounds for graph blocks, explaining the model's robustness. On

Method: GRETEL采用代理工作流，通过沙盒化的计划-执行-评估循环对语义检索的候选工具进行实证验证

Result: 在ToolBench基准测试中，Pass Rate从0.690提升至0.826，Recall从0.841提升至0.867，NDCG从0.807提升至0.857

Conclusion: 基于执行的验证比单纯语义相似度提供更可靠的工具选择基础，能实现更鲁棒的代理性能

Abstract: Despite remarkable advances in Large Language Model capabilities, tool
retrieval for agent-based systems remains fundamentally limited by reliance on
semantic similarity, which fails to capture functional viability. Current
methods often retrieve textually relevant but functionally inoperative tools
due to parameter mismatches, authentication failures, and execution
constraints--a phenomenon we term the semantic-functional gap. We introduce
GRETEL, to address this gap through systematic empirical validation. GRETEL
implements an agentic workflow that processes semantically retrieved candidates
through sandboxed plan-execute-evaluate cycles, generating execution-grounded
evidence to distinguish truly functional tools from merely descriptive matches.
Our comprehensive evaluation on the ToolBench benchmark demonstrates
substantial improvements across all metrics: Pass Rate (at 10) increases from
0.690 to 0.826, Recall (at 10) improves from 0.841 to 0.867, and NDCG (at 10)
rises from 0.807 to 0.857.. These results establish that execution-based
validation provides a more reliable foundation for tool selection than semantic
similarity alone, enabling more robust agent performance in real-world
applications.

*Waleed Razzaq,Yun-Bo Zhao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CARLE是一个混合AI框架，结合深度学习和浅层学习，用于轴承剩余使用寿命(RUL)预测，在动态工况下表现出优越性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的RUL预测方法在变化工况下缺乏泛化性和鲁棒性，需要开发更可靠的预测框架。

Method: 使用Res-CNN和Res-LSTM块结合多头注意力和残差连接来捕捉时空退化模式，随机森林回归器进行RUL预测，采用高斯滤波和连续小波变换进行预处理。

Result: 在XJTU-SY和PRONOSTIA轴承数据集上的实验表明，CARLE优于多种最先进方法，特别是在动态条件下表现更佳。

Conclusion: CARLE框架在RUL预测中展现出良好的泛化能力、鲁棒性和可解释性，为设备健康管理提供了可靠解决方案。

Abstract: Prognostic Health Management (PHM) systems monitor and predict equipment
health. A key task is Remaining Useful Life (RUL) estimation, which predicts
how long a component, such as a rolling element bearing, will operate before
failure. Many RUL methods exist but often lack generalizability and robustness
under changing operating conditions. This paper introduces CARLE, a hybrid AI
framework that combines deep and shallow learning to address these challenges.
CARLE uses Res-CNN and Res-LSTM blocks with multi-head attention and residual
connections to capture spatial and temporal degradation patterns, and a Random
Forest Regressor (RFR) for stable, accurate RUL prediction. A compact
preprocessing pipeline applies Gaussian filtering for noise reduction and
Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) for time-frequency feature extraction. We
evaluate CARLE on the XJTU-SY and PRONOSTIA bearing datasets. Ablation studies
measure each component's contribution, while noise and cross-domain experiments
test robustness and generalization. Comparative results show CARLE outperforms
several state-of-the-art methods, especially under dynamic conditions. Finally,
we analyze model interpretability with LIME and SHAP to assess transparency and
trustworthiness.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出NashPG算法，通过固定正则化强度并迭代优化参考策略，在两人零和博弈中实现严格单调改进并收敛到精确纳什均衡，无需唯一性假设。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统正则化方法需要将正则化强度逐渐减小到零来逼近纳什均衡，但在实践中往往导致学习不稳定。

Method: 固定正则化强度以保证鲁棒性，通过迭代优化参考策略实现收敛。开发了Nash Policy Gradient (NashPG)算法，仅依赖当前策略和参考策略。

Result: 理论证明该方法在两人零和博弈中保证严格单调改进并收敛到精确纳什均衡。在经典基准游戏上达到可比或更低的可被利用性，在大型领域如Battleship和No-Limit Texas Hold'em中持续获得更高的Elo评分。

Conclusion: NashPG方法在保持策略梯度方法通用性的同时，通过固定正则化强度和迭代参考策略优化，实现了稳定收敛到精确纳什均衡。

Abstract: Finding Nash equilibria in imperfect-information games remains a central
challenge in multi-agent reinforcement learning. While regularization-based
methods have recently achieved last-iteration convergence to a regularized
equilibrium, they require the regularization strength to shrink toward zero to
approximate a Nash equilibrium, often leading to unstable learning in practice.
Instead, we fix the regularization strength at a large value for robustness and
achieve convergence by iteratively refining the reference policy. Our main
theoretical result shows that this procedure guarantees strictly monotonic
improvement and convergence to an exact Nash equilibrium in two-player zero-sum
games, without requiring a uniqueness assumption. Building on this framework,
we develop a practical algorithm, Nash Policy Gradient (NashPG), which
preserves the generalizability of policy gradient methods while relying solely
on the current and reference policies. Empirically, NashPG achieves comparable
or lower exploitability than prior model-free methods on classic benchmark
games and scales to large domains such as Battleship and No-Limit Texas
Hold'em, where NashPG consistently attains higher Elo ratings.

a two-phase curriculum strategy emphasizing high-gradient regions. To

first validate it on the canonical viscous Burgers equation, which exhibits
advective steepening and shock like gradients.

TL;DR: 使用大型语言模型自动生成针对自动调优问题的优化算法，这些生成的算法在多个真实应用和硬件平台上能够媲美甚至超越现有的人工设计算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动性能调优对高性能应用至关重要，但传统优化算法在不同调优任务中表现不一，设计有效的优化器具有挑战性。

Method: 提出一个框架，通过向LLM提供问题描述和搜索空间特征来生成专门的优化策略，并进行迭代检查和改进。

Result: 在四个真实世界自动调优应用和六个硬件平台上评估，显示生成的优化算法平均性能提升30.7%和14.6%，最佳算法平均比最先进优化器提升72.4%。

Conclusion: LLM生成的优化器能够与人工设计算法竞争并在多种情况下超越它们，为自动调优提供了新的有效方法。

Abstract: Automatic performance tuning (auto-tuning) is essential for optimizing
high-performance applications, where vast and irregular parameter spaces make
manual exploration infeasible. Traditionally, auto-tuning relies on
well-established optimization algorithms such as evolutionary algorithms,
annealing methods, or surrogate model-based optimizers to efficiently find
near-optimal configurations. However, designing effective optimizers remains
challenging, as no single method performs best across all tuning tasks.
  In this work, we explore a new paradigm: using large language models (LLMs)
to automatically generate optimization algorithms tailored to auto-tuning
problems. We introduce a framework that prompts LLMs with problem descriptions
and search-space characteristics results to produce specialized optimization
strategies, which are iteratively examined and improved.
  These generated algorithms are evaluated on four real-world auto-tuning
applications across six hardware platforms and compared against the
state-of-the-art in optimization algorithms of two contemporary auto-tuning
frameworks. The evaluation demonstrates that providing additional application-
and search space-specific information in the generation stage results in an
average performance improvement of 30.7\% and 14.6\%, respectively. In
addition, our results show that LLM-generated optimizers can rival, and in
various cases outperform, existing human-designed algorithms, with our
best-performing generated optimization algorithms achieving, on average, 72.4\%
improvement over state-of-the-art optimizers for auto-tuning.

Motivation: 深度学习开源模型激增，但现有模型融合方法存在参数冲突问题，会降低领域特定任务的性能。

Method: 提出基于路由器的MIN-Merging框架，选择性融合最重要神经元以减少参数冲突。

Result: 在计算机视觉和自然语言处理基准测试中，MIN-Merging在领域内任务上取得一致性能提升，同时保持预训练模型在领域外任务上的泛化能力。

Conclusion: MIN-Merging是解决模型融合中参数冲突问题的有效实用方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have led to a surge of open-source models
across diverse domains. While model merging offers a promising way to combine
their strengths, existing approaches often suffer from parameter conflicts that
degrade performance on domain-specific tasks. We propose MIN-Merging, a
router-based framework that selectively merges the most important neurons to
reduce such conflicts. Extensive experiments on Computer Vision(CV) and Natural

gains on in-domain tasks while retaining the generalization ability of
pretrained models on out-of-domain tasks. These results highlight its
effectiveness as a practical solution to the parameter conflict problem in

*Hassan Gharoun,Mohammad Sadegh Khorshidi,Kasra Ranjbarigderi,Fang Chen,Amir H. Gandomi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于预测可靠性评估的后处理校准框架，通过语义相似性将校准样本分层，采用双校准策略分别处理可能正确和可能错误的预测，在保持校准质量的同时提升不确定性感知决策能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有神经网路校准方法通常采用全局变换，忽略了不同预测的异质可靠性，且校准改进与不确定性感知决策之间的关系尚未充分探索。

Method: 使用基于邻近性的共形预测将校准样本按特征空间语义相似性分层为可能正确和可能错误两组，对可能正确预测采用标准等渗回归校准置信度，对可能错误预测采用欠置信正则化等渗回归降低置信度至均匀分布。

Result: 在CIFAR-10和CIFAR-100数据集上的实验表明，该方法减少了自信错误预测，在预期校准误差方面与等渗回归和焦点损失基线方法表现相当。

Conclusion: 该工作通过实例级自适应性连接了校准和不确定性量化，提供了一种无需模型重训练的后处理解决方案，同时改善了概率对齐和不确定性感知决策。

Abstract: Despite extensive research on neural network calibration, existing methods
typically apply global transformations that treat all predictions uniformly,
overlooking the heterogeneous reliability of individual predictions.
Furthermore, the relationship between improved calibration and effective
uncertainty-aware decision-making remains largely unexplored. This paper
presents a post-hoc calibration framework that leverages prediction reliability
assessment to jointly enhance calibration quality and uncertainty-aware
decision-making. The framework employs proximity-based conformal prediction to
stratify calibration samples into putatively correct and putatively incorrect
groups based on semantic similarity in feature space. A dual calibration
strategy is then applied: standard isotonic regression calibrated confidence in
putatively correct predictions, while underconfidence-regularized isotonic
regression reduces confidence toward uniform distributions for putatively
incorrect predictions, facilitating their identification for further
investigations. A comprehensive evaluation is conducted using calibration
metrics, uncertainty-aware performance measures, and empirical conformal
coverage. Experiments on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 with BiT and CoAtNet backbones
show that the proposed method achieves lower confidently incorrect predictions,
and competitive Expected Calibration Error compared with isotonic and
focal-loss baselines. This work bridges calibration and uncertainty
quantification through instance-level adaptivity, offering a practical post-hoc
solution that requires no model retraining while improving both probability
alignment and uncertainty-aware decision-making.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在现实应用中的隐私安全问题日益突出，需要移除不良知识。现有机器遗忘方法面临连续异构需求和去中心化敏感数据的挑战，导致域间和域内干扰。

Method: 使用任务特定适配器学习解耦遗忘和保留过程，采用分层合并策略来缓解目标冲突，实现稳健、自适应的遗忘更新。

Result: 在WMDP、MUSE和TOFU基准测试上的综合实验表明，该方法能有效处理异构遗忘请求，同时相比基线方法保持强大的LLM效用。

Conclusion: 该方法为大规模语言模型提供了一种可扩展且保护隐私的联邦遗忘解决方案，能够平衡遗忘和保留性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into real-world
applications, raising concerns about privacy, security and the need to remove
undesirable knowledge. Machine Unlearning has emerged as a promising solution,
yet faces two key challenges: (1) practical unlearning needs are often
continuous and heterogeneous, and (2) they involve decentralized, sensitive
data with asymmetric access. These factors result in inter-domain and
intra-domain interference, which further amplifies the dilemma of unbalanced
forgetting and retaining performance. In response, we propose a federated
unlearning approach for LLMs that is scalable and privacy preserving. Our
method decouples unlearning and retention via task-specific adapter learning
and employs a hierarchical merging strategy to mitigate conflicting objectives
and enables robust, adaptable unlearning updates. Comprehensive experiments on
benchmarks of WMDP, MUSE, and TOFU showed that our approach effectively handles
heterogeneous unlearning requests while maintaining strong LLM utility compared
with baseline methods.

Motivation: 可靠的验证数据是现代语言模型能力提升的关键驱动力，但构建可泛化的合成验证数据仍然困难，因为存在幻觉倾向的生成和弱验证工件，现有方法依赖任务特定启发式或后处理过滤器，缺乏原则性的通用可验证性评估器。

Method: 采用进化式、任务无关、策略引导的可执行检查数据合成框架，从最小种子监督开始，联合合成问题、多样化候选解决方案和验证工件，通过基于一致性的评估器迭代发现策略，强制执行人工标注和策略诱导检查之间的一致性。

Result: 实验表明该方法在RLVR和模型蒸馏训练范式下均有效，使用合成数据训练在LiveCodeBench和AgentBench-OS任务上取得显著改进，证明了框架的鲁棒泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该框架将过滤升级为原则性合成，可靠地组装连贯的可验证训练实例，无需领域特定规则即可泛化，为语言模型训练提供了有效的验证数据合成方法。

Abstract: Reliable verifiable data has become a key driver of capability gains in
modern language models, enabling stable reinforcement learning with verifiable
rewards and effective distillation that transfers competence across math,
coding, and agentic tasks. Yet constructing generalizable synthetic verifiable
data remains difficult due to hallucination-prone generation, and weak or
trivial verification artifacts that fail to separate strong from weak
solutions. Existing approaches often rely on task-specific heuristics or
post-hoc filters that do not transfer across domains and lack a principled,
universal evaluator of verifiability. In this work, we introduce an
evolutionary, task-agnostic, strategy-guided, executably-checkable data
synthesis framework that, from minimal seed supervision, jointly synthesizes
problems, diverse candidate solutions, and verification artifacts, and
iteratively discovers strategies via a consistency-based evaluator that
enforces agreement between human-annotated and strategy-induced checks. This
pipeline upgrades filtering into principled synthesis: it reliably assembles
coherent, verifiable training instances and generalizes without domain-specific
rules. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach
under both RLVR and model distillation training paradigms. The results show
that training with our synthesized data yields significant improvements on both
the LiveCodeBench and AgentBench-OS tasks, highlighting the robust
generalization of our framework.

Motivation: 解决Transformer模型标准注意力机制在长序列训练中存在的二次计算和内存成本问题，填补现有评估不完整和框架特定的局限性。

Method: 构建模块化可扩展的基准测试框架，集成代表性注意力内核和上下文并行机制，在96 GPU集群上进行全面实验评估。

Result: 基准测试能够实现可重复比较，揭示方法特定的权衡，并为长上下文LLM训练中的注意力机制设计和部署提供实用指导。

Conclusion: 该统一基准填补了系统评估空白，有助于理解不同注意力优化方法在效率和可扩展性方面的表现，推动长上下文LLM训练的发展。

Abstract: Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable
success, yet their standard attention mechanism incurs quadratic computation
and memory costs with respect to sequence length, posing a major bottleneck for
long-context training. Prior work tackles this challenge along two directions:
(1) kernel-level optimizations, which accelerate dense and sparse attention
operators; and (2) module-level strategies, often referred to as distributed
attention or context parallel training, which scale attention across multiple
devices. However, systematic evaluation still remains limited: operator-level
comparisons are often incomplete, while context parallel strategies are
typically framework-specific, with unclear performance analysis across
contexts. To address these gaps, we propose a unified benchmark that integrates
representative attention kernels and context parallel mechanisms with a modular
and extensible interface for evaluation. The benchmark evaluates methods along
two critical dimensions: (1) attention mask patterns, which strongly affect
efficiency, scalability, and usability, and (2) sequence length and distributed
scale, which determine performance under extreme long-context training. Through
comprehensive experiments on the cluster of up to 96 GPUs, our benchmark
enables reproducible comparisons, highlights method-specific trade-offs, and
provides practical guidance for designing and deploying attention mechanisms in
long-context LLM training.

Result: 提出了一种参数效率高的MoE模型，具有模块化设计、动态技能组合和端到端可训练的特性。

Conclusion: L-MoE为构建更高效、可扩展和专门化的语言模型提供了一条新路径。

Abstract: The Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture enables the scaling of Large
Language Models (LLMs) to trillions of parameters by activating a sparse subset
of weights for each input, maintaining constant computational cost during
inference. Concurrently, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as a dominant
technique for parameter-efficiently fine-tuning LLMs on specialized tasks. In
this work, we unify these two paradigms into a novel, end-to-end trainable
framework named L-MoE: a Lightweight Mixture of LoRA Experts. L-MoE redefines
MoE experts not as dense feed-forward networks, but as a collection of
task-specialized, low-rank adapters. A lightweight gating network, trained
jointly with the experts, learns to dynamically compose these LoRA adapters by
computing a weighted average of their parameters for each input token. This
composition is fully differentiable, allowing gradients from a standard
auto-regressive language modeling objective to flow back through the entire
architecture, simultaneously refining both the expert adapters and the routing
strategy. This approach creates a highly parameter-efficient MoE model that is
modular by design, allows for dynamic skill composition, and is trainable from
end-to-end. We present the formal mathematical framework for L-MoE, detailing
the differentiable routing mechanism and the joint optimization objective,
thereby providing a new path toward building more efficient, scalable, and
specialized language models.

Motivation: 纵向联邦学习(VFL)在训练过程中需要大量通信，这会损害隐私和安全性，导致高能耗，在某些情况下甚至使模型训练不可行。

Method: 采用分布式训练机制，将大部分节点更新与服务器解耦，显著减少节点与服务器之间的通信。

Conclusion: SBVFL实现了实用、保护隐私的纵向联邦学习，适用于医疗、金融、制造、航空航天、网络安全和国防工业等敏感领域。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative decentralized training across
multiple parties (nodes) while keeping raw data private. There are two main
paradigms in FL: Horizontal FL (HFL), where all participant nodes share the
same feature space but hold different samples, and Vertical FL (VFL), where
participants hold complementary features for the same samples. While HFL is
widely adopted, VFL is employed in domains where nodes hold complementary
features about the same samples. Still, VFL presents a significant limitation:
the vast number of communications required during training. This compromises
privacy and security, and can lead to high energy consumption, and in some
cases, make model training unfeasible due to the high number of communications.
  In this paper, we introduce Sherpa.ai Blind Vertical Federated Learning
(SBVFL), a novel paradigm that leverages a distributed training mechanism
enhanced for privacy and security. Decoupling the vast majority of node updates
from the server dramatically reduces node-server communication. Experiments
show that SBVFL reduces communication by ~99% compared to standard VFL while
maintaining accuracy and robustness. Therefore, SBVFL enables practical,
privacy-preserving VFL across sensitive domains, including healthcare, finance,
manufacturing, aerospace, cybersecurity, and the defense industry.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前扩散模型的数据遗忘方法存在质量下降或遗忘不完整的问题，主要原因是现有方法在所有扩散时间步平等处理遗忘任务，而实际上遗忘在不同时间和频率上的影响是不均衡的。

Method: 采用时间-频率选择性方法，在训练过程中有选择地关注特定的时间-频率范围，将这种方法应用于基于梯度的和偏好优化的目标，以及图像级和文本到图像任务。

Conclusion: 该方法为扩散模型数据遗忘提供了更清晰的理解和实用策略，同时提出了标准化的SSCD评估指标来同时评估删除效果和生成质量。

Abstract: Data unlearning aims to remove the influence of specific training samples
from a trained model without requiring full retraining. Unlike concept
unlearning, data unlearning in diffusion models remains underexplored and often
suffers from quality degradation or incomplete forgetting. To address this, we
first observe that most existing methods attempt to unlearn the samples at all
diffusion time steps equally, leading to poor-quality generation. We argue that
forgetting occurs disproportionately across time and frequency, depending on
the model and scenarios. By selectively focusing on specific time-frequency
ranges during training, we achieve samples with higher aesthetic quality and
lower noise. We validate this improvement by applying our time-frequency
selective approach to diverse settings, including gradient-based and preference
optimization objectives, as well as both image-level and text-to-image tasks.
Finally, to evaluate both deletion and quality of unlearned data samples, we
propose a simple normalized version of SSCD. Together, our analysis and methods
establish a clearer understanding of the unique challenges in data unlearning
for diffusion models, providing practical strategies to improve both evaluation
and unlearning performance.

Conclusion: COMPASS为大语言模型从连续经验中学习提供了更可扩展的方向，系统性地增强了模型的分析能力。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for advancing
Large Language Models (LLMs), achieving remarkable performance in complex
reasoning domains such as mathematics and code generation. However, current RL
methods face a fundamental scalability bottleneck due to their heavy reliance
on human-curated preference data or labeled datasets for reward modeling. To
overcome this limitation, we explore RL on unlabeled data where models learn
autonomously from continuous experience streams. The core challenge in this
setting lies in reliable reward estimation without ground-truth supervision.
Existing approaches like Test-Time RL address this through self-consistent
consensus, but risk reinforcing incorrect pseudo-labels derived from majority
voting. We introduce COMPASS (Composite Path and Answer Self-Scoring), a novel
test-time reward mechanism that operates without external supervision. COMPASS
integrates two complementary components: the Dual-Calibration Answer Reward
(DCAR), which stabilizes training by establishing trustworthy pseudo-labels
through confidence and credibility calibration, and the Decisive Path Reward
(DPR), which directly optimizes the reasoning process quality beyond mere
outcome supervision. By jointly reinforcing trustworthy consensus answers and
highly decisive reasoning chains, the COMPASS systematically enhances the
model's analytical capabilities. Extensive experiments show that COMPASS
achieves significant and consistent performance gains across diverse reasoning
tasks and model architectures, advancing a more scalable direction for LLMs to
learn from continuous experience.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Param-CPD框架，通过神经后验估计器进行贝叶斯参数推断，然后在参数空间应用标准变化点检测算法，在混沌时间序列中实现更准确和可解释的体制转换检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在混沌时间序列中检测体制转换很困难，因为观测空间信号与内在变异性纠缠在一起，传统观测空间方法效果不佳。

Method: 两阶段框架：首先使用基于模拟推理训练的神经后验估计器进行参数推断，然后在得到的参数轨迹上应用标准变化点检测算法。

Result: 在Lorenz-63模型中，相比观测空间基线方法，Param-CPD提高了F1分数，减少了定位误差，降低了误报率。

Conclusion: 在物理可解释的参数空间中操作，能够在非线性动力系统中实现准确且可解释的变化点检测。

Abstract: Detecting regime shifts in chaotic time series is hard because
observation-space signals are entangled with intrinsic variability. We propose
Parameter--Space Changepoint Detection (Param--CPD), a two--stage framework
that first amortizes Bayesian inference of governing parameters with a neural
posterior estimator trained by simulation-based inference, and then applies a
standard CPD algorithm to the resulting parameter trajectory. On Lorenz--63
with piecewise-constant parameters, Param--CPD improves F1, reduces
localization error, and lowers false positives compared to observation--space
baselines. We further verify identifiability and calibration of the inferred
posteriors on stationary trajectories, explaining why parameter space offers a
cleaner detection signal. Robustness analyses over tolerance, window length,
and noise indicate consistent gains. Our results show that operating in a
physically interpretable parameter space enables accurate and interpretable
changepoint detection in nonlinear dynamical systems.

### [230] [Demystifying Transition Matching: When and Why It Can Beat Flow Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17991)
*Jaihoon Kim,Rajarshi Saha,Minhyuk Sung,Youngsuk Park*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文分析了Transition Matching(TM)何时及为何优于Flow Matching(FM)。在单峰高斯分布中，TM通过随机差分隐变量更新获得更低的KL散度。在多峰高斯混合分布中，当模式分离良好且方差不可忽略时，TM表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管Flow Matching支撑了许多最先进的生成模型，但近期研究表明Transition Matching能以更少的采样步骤获得更高质量的结果。本文旨在探究TM何时及为何优于FM。

Method: 首先在单峰高斯分布场景下，通过理论证明TM获得更低的KL散度，并分析收敛速度。然后扩展到高斯混合分布，识别局部单峰性机制，分析模式分离距离对性能的影响。

Result: 在单峰高斯分布中，TM确实获得严格更低的KL散度，且收敛速度更快。在高斯混合分布中，当模式分离良好且方差不可忽略时，TM表现优于FM。但当目标方差趋近于零时，TM的优势减弱。

Conclusion: TM在目标分布具有良好分离的模式和不可忽略的方差时优于FM。理论结果在控制实验中得到验证，并扩展到图像和视频生成的实际应用中。

Abstract: Flow Matching (FM) underpins many state-of-the-art generative models, yet
recent results indicate that Transition Matching (TM) can achieve higher
quality with fewer sampling steps. This work answers the question of when and
why TM outperforms FM. First, when the target is a unimodal Gaussian
distribution, we prove that TM attains strictly lower KL divergence than FM for
finite number of steps. The improvement arises from stochastic difference
latent updates in TM, which preserve target covariance that deterministic FM
underestimates. We then characterize convergence rates, showing that TM
achieves faster convergence than FM under a fixed compute budget, establishing
its advantage in the unimodal Gaussian setting. Second, we extend the analysis
to Gaussian mixtures and identify local-unimodality regimes in which the
sampling dynamics approximate the unimodal case, where TM can outperform FM.
The approximation error decreases as the minimal distance between component
means increases, highlighting that TM is favored when the modes are well
separated. However, when the target variance approaches zero, each TM update
converges to the FM update, and the performance advantage of TM diminishes. In
summary, we show that TM outperforms FM when the target distribution has
well-separated modes and non-negligible variances. We validate our theoretical
results with controlled experiments on Gaussian distributions, and extend the
comparison to real-world applications in image and video generation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出A-DATSC模型，结合深度子空间聚类生成器和质量验证判别器，通过注意力机制和Transformer架构解决传统方法在4D时空数据聚类中的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统深度子空间聚类方法存在浅层自编码器忽略聚类误差、强调全局特征忽视局部结构、无法建模长程依赖和位置信息、很少应用于4D时空数据等问题。

Method: 使用U-Net启发的生成器，通过堆叠TimeDistributed ConvLSTM2D层保持时空完整性；采用基于图注意力Transformer的自表达网络捕获局部空间关系、全局依赖和长短程相关性。

Result: 在三个真实世界多元时空数据集上的实验表明，A-DATSC相比最先进的深度子空间聚类模型实现了显著优越的聚类性能。

Conclusion: A-DATSC通过注意力引导的深度对抗时序子空间聚类方法，有效解决了传统方法在复杂时空数据聚类中的关键问题，取得了优异的性能。

Abstract: Deep subspace clustering models are vital for applications such as snowmelt
detection, sea ice tracking, crop health monitoring, infectious disease
modeling, network load prediction, and land-use planning, where multivariate
spatiotemporal data exhibit complex temporal dependencies and reside on
multiple nonlinear manifolds beyond the capability of traditional clustering
methods. These models project data into a latent space where samples lie in
linear subspaces and exploit the self-expressiveness property to uncover
intrinsic relationships. Despite their success, existing methods face major
limitations: they use shallow autoencoders that ignore clustering errors,
emphasize global features while neglecting local structure, fail to model
long-range dependencies and positional information, and are rarely applied to
4D spatiotemporal data. To address these issues, we propose A-DATSC
(Attention-Guided Deep Adversarial Temporal Subspace Clustering), a model
combining a deep subspace clustering generator and a quality-verifying
discriminator. The generator, inspired by U-Net, preserves spatial and temporal
integrity through stacked TimeDistributed ConvLSTM2D layers, reducing
parameters and enhancing generalization. A graph attention transformer based
self-expressive network captures local spatial relationships, global
dependencies, and both short- and long-range correlations. Experiments on three
real-world multivariate spatiotemporal datasets show that A-DATSC achieves
substantially superior clustering performance compared to state-of-the-art deep
subspace clustering models.

Abstract: Neural activity forecasting is central to understanding neural systems and
enabling closed-loop control. While deep learning has recently advanced the
state-of-the-art in the time series forecasting literature, its application to
neural activity forecasting remains limited. To bridge this gap, we
systematically evaluated eight probabilistic deep learning models, including
two foundation models, that have demonstrated strong performance on general
forecasting benchmarks. We compared them against four classical statistical
models and two baseline methods on spontaneous neural activity recorded from
mouse cortex via widefield imaging. Across prediction horizons, several deep
learning models consistently outperformed classical approaches, with the best
model producing informative forecasts up to 1.5 seconds into the future. Our
findings point toward future control applications and open new avenues for
probing the intrinsic temporal structure of neural activity.

Conclusion: 该框架建立了跨域算子推断的通用原则，为物理、气候和能源系统中的复杂时空场实时预测提供了新途径。

Abstract: Forecasting unobservable physical quantities from sparse, cross-domain sensor
data is a central unsolved problem in scientific machine learning. Existing
neural operators and large-scale forecasters rely on dense, co-located
input-output fields and short temporal contexts, assumptions that fail in
real-world systems where sensing and prediction occur on distinct physical
manifolds and over long timescales. We introduce the Spatio-Temporal Operator
Network (STONe), a non-autoregressive neural operator that learns a stable
functional mapping between heterogeneous domains. By directly inferring
high-altitude radiation dose fields from sparse ground-based neutron
measurements, STONe demonstrates that operator learning can generalize beyond
shared-domain settings. It defines a nonlinear operator between sensor and
target manifolds that remains stable over long forecasting horizons without
iterative recurrence. This challenges the conventional view that operator
learning requires domain alignment or autoregressive propagation. Trained on 23
years of global neutron data, STONe achieves accurate 180-day forecasts with
millisecond inference latency. The framework establishes a general principle
for cross-domain operator inference, enabling real-time prediction of complex
spatiotemporal fields in physics, climate, and energy systems.

Method: 采用测度论框架，包含低层表示捕获标签生成观察的机制，高层表示学习跨环境变化的稳定因果模式，使用干预核处理完美和不完美干预，无需显式因果结构。

Result: 在合成和真实医疗数据集上的实验表明，ACIA在准确性和不变性指标上持续优于最先进方法。

Conclusion: ACIA为稳健的反因果学习提供了有效框架，理论结果建立了训练和未见环境之间性能差距的紧密界限。

Abstract: Causal representation learning in the anti-causal setting (labels cause
features rather than the reverse) presents unique challenges requiring
specialized approaches. We propose Anti-Causal Invariant Abstractions (ACIA), a
novel measure-theoretic framework for anti-causal representation learning. ACIA
employs a two-level design, low-level representations capture how labels
generate observations, while high-level representations learn stable causal
patterns across environment-specific variations. ACIA addresses key limitations
of existing approaches by accommodating prefect and imperfect interventions
through interventional kernels, eliminating dependency on explicit causal
structures, handling high-dimensional data effectively, and providing
theoretical guarantees for out-of-distribution generalization. Experiments on
synthetic and real-world medical datasets demonstrate that ACIA consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both accuracy and invariance metrics.
Furthermore, our theoretical results establish tight bounds on performance gaps
between training and unseen environments, confirming the efficacy of our
approach for robust anti-causal learning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ADRPO是一种自适应发散正则化策略优化方法，通过基于优势估计自动调整正则化强度，解决了生成模型强化学习微调中的探索-利用困境。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖固定发散正则化，导致两难困境：强正则化保留模型能力但限制奖励优化，弱正则化可实现更好对齐但带来不稳定或奖励黑客风险。

Method: 使用自适应发散正则化策略优化，根据优势估计自动调整正则化强度：对高价值样本减少正则化，对差样本应用更强正则化，使策略能根据数据质量在探索和积极利用间导航。

Result: 在文本到图像生成中，ADRPO在语义对齐和多样性方面优于DPO和ORW-CFM-W2等方法；2B参数的SD3模型在属性绑定、语义一致性、艺术风格迁移和组合控制方面超越4.8B和12B参数模型；在LLM和多模态推理模型中也表现出色。

Conclusion: ADRPO为跨不同生成架构和模态的探索-利用挑战提供了有效的即插即用解决方案，在保持生成多样性的同时实现更好的对齐性能。

Abstract: Balancing exploration and exploitation during reinforcement learning
fine-tuning of generative models presents a critical challenge, as existing
approaches rely on fixed divergence regularization that creates an inherent
dilemma: strong regularization preserves model capabilities but limits reward
optimization, while weak regularization enables greater alignment but risks
instability or reward hacking. We introduce Adaptive Divergence Regularized
Policy Optimization (ADRPO), which automatically adjusts regularization
strength based on advantage estimates-reducing regularization for high-value
samples while applying stronger regularization to poor samples, enabling
policies to navigate between exploration and aggressive exploitation according
to data quality. Our implementation with Wasserstein-2 regularization for flow
matching generative models achieves remarkable results on text-to-image
generation, achieving better semantic alignment and diversity than offline
methods like DPO and online methods with fixed regularization like ORW-CFM-W2.
ADRPO enables a 2B parameter SD3 model to surpass much larger models with 4.8B
and 12B parameters in attribute binding, semantic consistency, artistic style
transfer, and compositional control while maintaining generation diversity.
ADRPO generalizes to KL-regularized fine-tuning of both text-only LLMs and
multi-modal reasoning models, enhancing existing online RL methods like GRPO.
In LLM fine-tuning, ADRPO demonstrates an emergent ability to escape local
optima through active exploration, while in multi-modal audio reasoning, it
outperforms GRPO through superior step-by-step reasoning, enabling a 7B model
to outperform substantially larger commercial models including Gemini 2.5 Pro
and GPT-4o Audio, offering an effective plug-and-play solution to the
exploration-exploitation challenge across diverse generative architectures and
modalities.

Conclusion: SPACeR建立了测试自动驾驶策略的新范式，通过快速可扩展的交通仿真有效衡量规划器质量。

Abstract: Developing autonomous vehicles (AVs) requires not only safety and efficiency,
but also realistic, human-like behaviors that are socially aware and
predictable. Achieving this requires sim agent policies that are human-like,
fast, and scalable in multi-agent settings. Recent progress in imitation
learning with large diffusion-based or tokenized models has shown that
behaviors can be captured directly from human driving data, producing realistic
policies. However, these models are computationally expensive, slow during
inference, and struggle to adapt in reactive, closed-loop scenarios. In
contrast, self-play reinforcement learning (RL) scales efficiently and
naturally captures multi-agent interactions, but it often relies on heuristics
and reward shaping, and the resulting policies can diverge from human norms. We
propose SPACeR, a framework that leverages a pretrained tokenized
autoregressive motion model as a centralized reference policy to guide
decentralized self-play. The reference model provides likelihood rewards and KL
divergence, anchoring policies to the human driving distribution while
preserving RL scalability. Evaluated on the Waymo Sim Agents Challenge, our
method achieves competitive performance with imitation-learned policies while
being up to 10x faster at inference and 50x smaller in parameter size than
large generative models. In addition, we demonstrate in closed-loop ego
planning evaluation tasks that our sim agents can effectively measure planner
quality with fast and scalable traffic simulation, establishing a new paradigm
for testing autonomous driving policies.

Conclusion: 即使使用计算高效的评论家模型，AC-Flow也能稳健地微调流模型，不损害生成质量、多样性或稳定性。

Abstract: Flow-based generative models have shown remarkable success in text-to-image
generation, yet fine-tuning them with intermediate feedback remains
challenging, especially for continuous-time flow matching models. Most existing
approaches solely learn from outcome rewards, struggling with the credit
assignment problem. Alternative methods that attempt to learn a critic via
direct regression on cumulative rewards often face training instabilities and
model collapse in online settings. We present AC-Flow, a robust actor-critic
framework that addresses these challenges through three key innovations: (1)
reward shaping that provides well-normalized learning signals to enable stable
intermediate value learning and gradient control, (2) a novel dual-stability
mechanism that combines advantage clipping to prevent destructive policy
updates with a warm-up phase that allows the critic to mature before
influencing the actor, and (3) a scalable generalized critic weighting scheme
that extends traditional reward-weighted methods while preserving model
diversity through Wasserstein regularization. Through extensive experiments on
Stable Diffusion 3, we demonstrate that AC-Flow achieves state-of-the-art
performance in text-to-image alignment tasks and generalization to unseen human
preference models. Our results demonstrate that even with a computationally
efficient critic model, we can robustly finetune flow models without
compromising generative quality, diversity, or stability.

<details>

Motivation: 传统RL算法专注于最大化期望回报，但许多实际应用（如路由、资源分配、风险决策）需要确保高成功概率的策略，而不仅仅是平均性能。

Method: 通过状态增强表示将可靠RL问题重新表述为标准RL问题，允许使用现有RL算法（如Q-learning、Dueling Double DQN）而无需全新框架。

Result: 理论证明两种表述的等价性，数值实验显示该方法在可靠路由问题中能有效平衡效率和可靠性。

Conclusion: 可靠RL框架适用于随机和安全关键环境，能够提供性能保证的策略，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: In this work, we address the problem of determining reliable policies in
reinforcement learning (RL), with a focus on optimization under uncertainty and
the need for performance guarantees. While classical RL algorithms aim at
maximizing the expected return, many real-world applications - such as routing,
resource allocation, or sequential decision-making under risk - require
strategies that ensure not only high average performance but also a guaranteed
probability of success. To this end, we propose a novel formulation in which
the objective is to maximize the probability that the cumulative return exceeds
a prescribed threshold. We demonstrate that this reliable RL problem can be
reformulated, via a state-augmented representation, into a standard RL problem,
thereby allowing the use of existing RL and deep RL algorithms without the need
for entirely new algorithmic frameworks. Theoretical results establish the
equivalence of the two formulations and show that reliable strategies can be
derived by appropriately adapting well-known methods such as Q-learning or
Dueling Double DQN. To illustrate the practical relevance of the approach, we
consider the problem of reliable routing, where the goal is not to minimize the
expected travel time but rather to maximize the probability of reaching the
destination within a given time budget. Numerical experiments confirm that the
proposed formulation leads to policies that effectively balance efficiency and
reliability, highlighting the potential of reliable RL for applications in
stochastic and safety-critical environments.

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) holds great potential to advance anomaly detection (AD)
in chemical processes. However, the development of ML-based methods is hindered
by the lack of openly available experimental data. To address this gap, we have
set up a laboratory-scale batch distillation plant and operated it to generate
an extensive experimental database, covering fault-free experiments and
experiments in which anomalies were intentionally induced, for training
advanced ML-based AD methods. In total, 119 experiments were conducted across a
wide range of operating conditions and mixtures. Most experiments containing
anomalies were paired with a corresponding fault-free one. The database that we
provide here includes time-series data from numerous sensors and actuators,
along with estimates of measurement uncertainty. In addition, unconventional
data sources -- such as concentration profiles obtained via online benchtop NMR
spectroscopy and video and audio recordings -- are provided. Extensive metadata
and expert annotations of all experiments are included. The anomaly annotations
are based on an ontology developed in this work. The data are organized in a
structured database and made freely available via
doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17395544. This new database paves the way for the
development of advanced ML-based AD methods. As it includes information on the
causes of anomalies, it further enables the development of interpretable and
explainable ML approaches, as well as methods for anomaly mitigation.

Abstract: Modelling the complex spatiotemporal patterns of large-scale brain dynamics
is crucial for neuroscience, but traditional methods fail to capture the rich
structure in modalities such as magnetoencephalography (MEG). Recent advances
in deep learning have enabled significant progress in other domains, such as
language and vision, by using foundation models at scale. Here, we introduce
MEG-GPT, a transformer based foundation model that uses time-attention and next
time-point prediction. To facilitate this, we also introduce a novel
data-driven tokeniser for continuous MEG data, which preserves the high
temporal resolution of continuous MEG signals without lossy transformations. We
trained MEG-GPT on tokenised brain region time-courses extracted from a
large-scale MEG dataset (N=612, eyes-closed rest, Cam-CAN data), and show that
the learnt model can generate data with realistic spatio-spectral properties,
including transient events and population variability. Critically, it performs
well in downstream decoding tasks, improving downstream supervised prediction
task, showing improved zero-shot generalisation across sessions (improving
accuracy from 0.54 to 0.59) and subjects (improving accuracy from 0.41 to 0.49)
compared to a baseline methods. Furthermore, we show the model can be
efficiently fine-tuned on a smaller labelled dataset to boost performance in
cross-subject decoding scenarios. This work establishes a powerful foundation
model for electrophysiological data, paving the way for applications in
computational neuroscience and neural decoding.

Method: 提出Any-Depth Alignment (ADA)，基于观察发现对齐能力集中在助手头部令牌中。通过在生成过程中重新引入这些令牌，诱导模型重新评估危害性并恢复拒绝能力。

Result: 在多个开源模型家族上，ADA实现了接近100%的拒绝率对抗对抗性预填充攻击，将主要对抗提示攻击的平均成功率降至3%以下，同时保持良性任务的实用性。

Conclusion: ADA是一种有效的推理时防御方法，能够解锁LLMs的固有浅层对齐能力，在任意生成深度提供强大的安全保护，且对模型实用性影响最小。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit strong but shallow alignment: they
directly refuse harmful queries when a refusal is expected at the very start of
an assistant turn, yet this protection collapses once a harmful continuation is
underway (either through the adversarial attacks or via harmful
assistant-prefill attacks). This raises a fundamental question: Can the innate
shallow alignment in LLMs be unlocked to ensure safety at arbitrary generation
depths? To achieve this goal, we propose Any-Depth Alignment (ADA), an
effective inference-time defense with negligible overhead. ADA is built based
on our observation that alignment is concentrated in the assistant header
tokens through repeated use in shallow-refusal training, and these tokens
possess the model's strong alignment priors. By reintroducing these tokens
mid-stream, ADA induces the model to reassess harmfulness and recover refusals
at any point in generation. Across diverse open-source model families (Llama,
Gemma, Mistral, Qwen, DeepSeek, and gpt-oss), ADA achieves robust safety
performance without requiring any changes to the base model's parameters. It
secures a near-100% refusal rate against challenging adversarial prefill
attacks ranging from dozens to thousands of tokens. Furthermore, ADA reduces
the average success rate of prominent adversarial prompt attacks (such as GCG,
AutoDAN, PAIR, and TAP) to below 3%. This is all accomplished while preserving
utility on benign tasks with minimal over-refusal. ADA maintains this
resilience even after the base model undergoes subsequent instruction tuning
(benign or adversarial).

*Donggeon David Oh,Duy P. Nguyen,Haimin Hu,Jaime F. Fisac*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文证明了在强化学习中，使用足够宽松的安全过滤器强制执行安全性不会降低渐近性能，实现了安全性和性能的完全分离。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 强化学习在复杂任务中应用广泛，但缺乏正式的安全保证限制了其在安全关键场景中的使用。安全过滤器常被认为会牺牲性能并阻碍学习过程，作者旨在证明这种安全-性能权衡并非固有。

Method: 定义了安全关键马尔可夫决策过程（SC-MDP）和相关的过滤MDP，其中安全过滤器被视为环境的一部分。通过理论证明在过滤MDP中学习是安全的，且标准RL收敛性仍然成立。

Result: 在Safety Gymnasium上的实验验证了理论，训练过程中零违规，最终性能达到或超过无过滤基线。

Conclusion: 为安全RL提供了一个简单而原则性的方法：使用可用的最宽松安全过滤器来训练和部署RL策略。

Abstract: Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) enable its use on increasingly
complex tasks, but the lack of formal safety guarantees still limits its
application in safety-critical settings. A common practical approach is to
augment the RL policy with a safety filter that overrides unsafe actions to
prevent failures during both training and deployment. However, safety filtering
is often perceived as sacrificing performance and hindering the learning
process. We show that this perceived safety-performance tradeoff is not
inherent and prove, for the first time, that enforcing safety with a
sufficiently permissive safety filter does not degrade asymptotic performance.
We formalize RL safety with a safety-critical Markov decision process (SC-MDP),
which requires categorical, rather than high-probability, avoidance of
catastrophic failure states. Additionally, we define an associated filtered MDP
in which all actions result in safe effects, thanks to a safety filter that is
considered to be a part of the environment. Our main theorem establishes that
(i) learning in the filtered MDP is safe categorically, (ii) standard RL
convergence carries over to the filtered MDP, and (iii) any policy that is
optimal in the filtered MDP-when executed through the same filter-achieves the
same asymptotic return as the best safe policy in the SC-MDP, yielding a
complete separation between safety enforcement and performance optimization. We
validate the theory on Safety Gymnasium with representative tasks and
constraints, observing zero violations during training and final performance
matching or exceeding unfiltered baselines. Together, these results shed light
on a long-standing question in safety-filtered learning and provide a simple,
principled recipe for safe RL: train and deploy RL policies with the most
permissive safety filter that is available.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 开发并评估了结合结构化临床数据和非结构化文本信息的机器学习模型，用于ICU住院死亡率的早期预测，结果显示文本特征的加入显著提升了预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ICU住院死亡率的准确早期预测对于及时临床干预和高效资源配置至关重要，需要整合多种数据源来提升预测能力。

Method: 使用LASSO和XGBoost进行特征选择，然后基于两种模型识别出的重要特征训练多元逻辑回归模型，结合TF-IDF和BERT嵌入来处理文本特征。

Result: 结合结构化和文本特征的最终逻辑回归模型AUC达到0.918，相比仅使用结构化数据的0.753有22%的相对提升，决策曲线分析显示在广泛阈值概率范围内具有优越的标准化净收益。

Conclusion: 非结构化临床笔记具有额外的预后价值，应将其整合到可解释的特征驱动风险预测模型中，以提升ICU患者的预测准确性。

Abstract: Accurate early prediction of in-hospital mortality in intensive care units
(ICUs) is essential for timely clinical intervention and efficient resource
allocation. This study develops and evaluates machine learning models that
integrate both structured clinical data and unstructured textual information,
specifically discharge summaries and radiology reports, from the MIMIC-IV
database. We used LASSO and XGBoost for feature selection, followed by a
multivariate logistic regression trained on the top features identified by both
models. Incorporating textual features using TF-IDF and BERT embeddings
significantly improved predictive performance. The final logistic regression
model, which combined structured and textual input, achieved an AUC of 0.918,
compared to 0.753 when using structured data alone, a relative improvement 22%.
The analysis of the decision curve demonstrated a superior standardized net
benefit in a wide range of threshold probabilities (0.2-0.8), confirming the
clinical utility of the model. These results underscore the added prognostic
value of unstructured clinical notes and support their integration into
interpretable feature-driven risk prediction models for ICU patients.

*Dario Shariatian,Alain Durmus,Stefano Peluchetti*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出潜在离散扩散模型(LDDMs)，通过结合离散标记的掩码扩散和潜在嵌入的连续扩散，解决了传统掩码去噪器在少步生成中联合结构弱化的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统掩码去噪器的反向转换通常在各位置间因子化，这会削弱联合结构并在少步生成中降低质量。

Method: 提出LDDMs，将离散标记的掩码扩散与潜在嵌入的连续扩散耦合。提出两种实现：FUJI-LDDMs（完全联合去噪）和SEQ-LDDMs（顺序解析潜在和离散链）。

Result: LDDMs在无条件生成指标上相比最先进的掩码离散扩散基线有所改进，在较低采样预算下特别有效。

Conclusion: 潜在通道提供更柔和的信号并携带跨标记依赖关系，有助于解决歧义，在少步生成中表现优异。

Abstract: We study discrete diffusion for language and other categorical data and focus
on a common limitation of masked denoisers: reverse transitions typically
factorize across positions, which can weaken joint structure and degrade
quality in few-step generation. We propose \emph{Latent Discrete Diffusion
Models} (LDDMs), which couple a masked discrete diffusion over tokens with a
continuous diffusion over latent embeddings. The latent channel provides a
softer signal and carries cross-token dependencies that help resolve
ambiguities. We present two instantiations: (i) FUJI-LDDMs, which perform fully
joint denoising of tokens and latents, and (ii) SEQ-LDDMs, which sequentially
resolve the latent and then the discrete chain conditionally on it. For both
variants we derive ELBO-style objectives and discuss design choices to learn
informative latents yet amenable to diffusoin modeling. In experiments, LDDMs
yield improvements on unconditional generation metrics as compared to
state-of-the-art masked discrete diffusion baselines, and are effective at
lower sampling budgets, where unmasking many tokens per step is desirable.

TL;DR: Rectified Flows在确定性训练下存在记忆化问题，即使插值线相交也会记忆任意训练配对，而添加少量噪声可以恢复泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分析Rectified Flows中直线路径目标隐藏的基本失败模式，特别是在确定性训练下出现的记忆化问题。

Method: 研究高斯到高斯传输，通过损失梯度方差分析随机和确定性机制下优化偏好的向量场，并在CelebA数据集上进行实证验证。

Result: 在插值线相交的情况下，Rectified Flow在推理时会产生与训练时相同的特定配对。确定性插值导致记忆化，而注入小噪声可恢复泛化。

Conclusion: 直线路径目标优化会收敛到定义不良的向量场，确定性积分会重现确切的训练配对，噪声注入是恢复泛化能力的关键。

Abstract: Rectified Flows learn ODE vector fields whose trajectories are straight
between source and target distributions, enabling near one-step inference. We
show that this straight-path objective conceals fundamental failure modes:
under deterministic training, low gradient variance drives memorization of
arbitrary training pairings, even when interpolant lines between pairs
intersect. To analyze this mechanism, we study Gaussian-to-Gaussian transport
and use the loss gradient variance across stochastic and deterministic regimes
to characterize which vector fields optimization favors in each setting. We
then show that, in a setting where all interpolating lines intersect, applying
Rectified Flow yields the same specific pairings at inference as during
training. More generally, we prove that a memorizing vector field exists even
when training interpolants intersect, and that optimizing the straight-path
objective converges to this ill-defined field. At inference, deterministic
integration reproduces the exact training pairings. We validate our findings
empirically on the CelebA dataset, confirming that deterministic interpolants
induce memorization, while the injection of small noise restores
generalization.

TL;DR: 提出了核心注意力解耦（CAD）技术，通过将核心注意力计算与模型其他部分分离并在专用设备上执行，解决了长上下文训练中的负载不平衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有系统中核心注意力与其他层共置，在长上下文下其二次计算增长导致数据并行和流水线并行组中的负载不平衡和拖尾问题。

Method: 将核心注意力分解为token级任务，调度到专用注意力服务器上，动态重新批处理任务以平衡计算而不牺牲内核效率。

Result: 在512个H200 GPU和512k token上下文长度下，DistCA系统将端到端训练吞吐量提升1.35倍，消除了数据并行和流水线并行拖尾，实现了近乎完美的计算和内存平衡。

Conclusion: CAD技术通过解耦核心注意力计算，有效解决了长上下文训练中的负载不平衡问题，显著提升了训练效率。

Abstract: We present core attention disaggregation (CAD), a technique that improves
long-context large language model training by decoupling the core attention
computation, softmax(QK^T)V, from the rest of the model and executing it on a
separate pool of devices. In existing systems, core attention is colocated with
other layers; at long context lengths, its quadratic compute growth compared to
the near-linear growth of other components causes load imbalance and stragglers
across data and pipeline parallel groups. CAD is enabled by two observations.
First, core attention is stateless: it has no trainable parameters and only
minimal transient data, so balancing reduces to scheduling compute-bound tasks.
Second, it is composable: modern attention kernels retain high efficiency when
processing fused batches of token-level shards with arbitrary lengths. CAD
partitions core attention into token-level tasks and dispatches them to
dedicated attention servers, which dynamically rebatch tasks to equalize
compute without sacrificing kernel efficiency. We implement CAD in a system
called DistCA, which uses a ping-pong execution scheme to fully overlap
communication with computation and in-place execution on attention servers to
reduce memory use. On 512 H200 GPUs and context lengths up to 512k tokens,
DistCA improves end-to-end training throughput by up to 1.35x, eliminates data
and pipeline parallel stragglers, and achieves near-perfect compute and memory
balance.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HyperDiffusionFields (HyDiF) 是一个将3D分子构象建模为连续场的框架，使用分子方向场(MDF)表示分子结构，通过超网络生成分子神经场(MNFs)，并采用扩散模型实现生成功能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于离散原子坐标或图的方法难以实现空间细粒度特征提取，且在处理大分子时存在局限性。HyDiF旨在通过连续场表示克服这些限制。

Method: 使用分子方向场(MDF)表示分子结构，通过超网络生成分子特定的神经隐式场(MNFs)，并训练超网络作为去噪扩散模型，支持掩码扩散机制。

Result: 该方法支持分子生成、结构条件生成任务(如分子修复)，并能进行空间细粒度特征提取用于分子性质预测，且可扩展到更大的生物分子。

Conclusion: HyDiF展示了基于场的分子建模的潜力，为分子表示和生成提供了新的连续场方法。

Abstract: We introduce HyperDiffusionFields (HyDiF), a framework that models 3D
molecular conformers as continuous fields rather than discrete atomic
coordinates or graphs. At the core of our approach is the Molecular Directional
Field (MDF), a vector field that maps any point in space to the direction of
the nearest atom of a particular type. We represent MDFs using
molecule-specific neural implicit fields, which we call Molecular Neural Fields
(MNFs). To enable learning across molecules and facilitate generalization, we
adopt an approach where a shared hypernetwork, conditioned on a molecule,
generates the weights of the given molecule's MNF. To endow the model with
generative capabilities, we train the hypernetwork as a denoising diffusion
model, enabling sampling in the function space of molecular fields. Our design
naturally extends to a masked diffusion mechanism to support
structure-conditioned generation tasks, such as molecular inpainting, by
selectively noising regions of the field. Beyond generation, the localized and
continuous nature of MDFs enables spatially fine-grained feature extraction for
molecular property prediction, something not easily achievable with graph or
point cloud based methods. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our approach scales
to larger biomolecules, illustrating a promising direction for field-based
molecular modeling.

Method: 使用凸差(DC)框架，提出了多个新颖的PCA公式，包括核化方法和样本外应用，同时揭示了同时迭代法(与经典QR算法相关)是凸差算法的一个实例。

Result: 开发了新的PCA算法，并与最先进方法进行了实证比较，提出了最小化重构误差l1偏差的鲁棒PCA的核化对偶公式。

Conclusion: 凸差框架为PCA提供了新的理论视角和算法设计方法，建立了与经典数值方法之间的联系，并扩展了PCA的核化和鲁棒性能力。

Abstract: Motivated by the recently shown connection between self-attention and
(kernel) principal component analysis (PCA), we revisit the fundamentals of
PCA. Using the difference-of-convex (DC) framework, we present several novel
formulations and provide new theoretical insights. In particular, we show the
kernelizability and out-of-sample applicability for a PCA-like family of
problems. Moreover, we uncover that simultaneous iteration, which is connected
to the classical QR algorithm, is an instance of the difference-of-convex
algorithm (DCA), offering an optimization perspective on this longstanding
method. Further, we describe new algorithms for PCA and empirically compare
them with state-of-the-art methods. Lastly, we introduce a kernelizable dual
formulation for a robust variant of PCA that minimizes the $l_1$ deviation of
the reconstruction errors.

TL;DR: 提出了ActivationReasoning框架，将显式逻辑推理嵌入到LLM的潜在空间中，通过三个步骤实现：识别潜在概念表示、激活命题、逻辑推理，从而提升模型的可解释性和可控性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM内部推理不透明且难以控制的问题，虽然稀疏自编码器能暴露潜在特征，但这些特征脆弱且被动，缺乏系统推理机制。

Method: 三阶段框架：(1)通过SAE等方法识别潜在概念表示并组织成字典；(2)推理时检测激活概念并映射为逻辑命题；(3)应用逻辑规则进行推理，推断高阶结构、组合新概念并引导模型行为。

Result: 在多个任务上评估（PrOntoQA、Rail2Country、ProverQA、BeaverTails），AR能随着推理复杂性扩展而保持鲁棒性，泛化到抽象和上下文敏感任务，并在不同模型骨干间迁移。

Conclusion: 将逻辑结构嵌入潜在激活不仅能提高透明度，还能实现结构化推理、可靠控制和与期望行为对齐，为更可靠和可审计的AI提供路径。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at generating fluent text, but their
internal reasoning remains opaque and difficult to control. Sparse autoencoders
(SAEs) make hidden activations more interpretable by exposing latent features
that often align with human concepts. Yet, these features are fragile and
passive, offering no mechanism for systematic reasoning or model control. To
address this, we introduce ActivationReasoning (AR), a framework that embeds
explicit logical reasoning into the latent space of LLMs. It proceeds in three
stages: (1) Finding latent representations, first latent concept
representations are identified (e.g., via SAEs) and organized into a
dictionary; (2) Activating propositions, at inference time AR detects
activating concepts and maps them to logical propositions; and (3)Logical
reasoning, applying logical rules over these propositions to infer higher-order
structures, compose new concepts, and steer model behavior. We evaluate AR on
multi-hop reasoning (PrOntoQA), abstraction and robustness to indirect concept
cues (Rail2Country), reasoning over natural and diverse language (ProverQA),
and context-sensitive safety (BeaverTails). Across all tasks, AR scales
robustly with reasoning complexity, generalizes to abstract and
context-sensitive tasks, and transfers across model backbones. These results
demonstrate that grounding logical structure in latent activations not only
improves transparency but also enables structured reasoning, reliable control,
and alignment with desired behaviors, providing a path toward more reliable and
auditable AI.

Abstract: The objective of designing a control system is to steer a dynamical system
with a control signal, guiding it to exhibit the desired behavior. The
Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) partial differential equation offers a framework
for optimal control system design. However, numerical solutions to this
equation are computationally intensive, and analytical solutions are frequently
unavailable. Knowledge-guided machine learning methodologies, such as
physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), offer new alternative approaches that
can alleviate the difficulties of solving the HJB equation numerically. This
work presents a multistage ensemble framework to learn the optimal cost-to-go,
and subsequently the corresponding optimal control signal, through the HJB
equation. Prior PINN-based approaches rely on a stabilizing the HJB enforcement
during training. Our framework does not use stabilizer terms and offers a means
of controlling the nonlinear system, via either a singular learned control
signal or an ensemble control signal policy. Success is demonstrated in
closed-loop control, using both ensemble- and singular-control, of a
steady-state time-invariant two-state continuous nonlinear system with an
infinite time horizon, accounting of noisy, perturbed system states and varying
initial conditions.

Abstract: This paper investigates underwater cooperative target detection using
autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), with a focus on the critical trade-off
between cooperation efficiency and communication covertness. To tackle this
challenge, we first formulate a joint trajectory and power control optimization
problem, and then present an innovative hierarchical action management
framework to solve it. According to the hierarchical formulation, at the macro
level, the master AUV models the agent selection process as a Markov decision
process and deploys the proximal policy optimization algorithm for strategic
task allocation. At the micro level, each selected agent's decentralized
decision-making is modeled as a partially observable Markov decision process,
and a multi-agent proximal policy optimization algorithm is used to dynamically
adjust its trajectory and transmission power based on its local observations.
Under the centralized training and decentralized execution paradigm, our target
detection framework enables adaptive covert cooperation while satisfying both
energy and mobility constraints. By comprehensively modeling the considered
system, the involved signals and tasks, as well as energy consumption,
theoretical insights and practical solutions for the efficient and secure
operation of multiple AUVs are provided, offering significant implications for
the execution of underwater covert communication tasks.

Motivation: 现有零阶优化方法在梯度估计中存在高方差问题，导致收敛慢且性能欠佳，特别是在大规模模型上。

Method: 首先估计低维梯度空间，然后在投影梯度方向对齐扰动，减少扰动参数数量和方差。

Result: 在分类任务上准确率提升达6%，生成任务上准确率提升达12%，训练迭代减少约81%，GPU时间减少70%。

Conclusion: P-GAP实现了快速、可扩展且资源高效的零阶LLM微调。

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) using zeroth-order (ZO) optimization
has emerged as a promising alternative to traditional gradient-based methods
due to its reduced memory footprint requirement. However, existing ZO methods
suffer from high variance in gradient estimation, leading to slow convergence
and suboptimal performance on large-scale models. In this work, we propose
P-GAP, a fast LLM fine-tuning approach through zeroth-order optimization with
Projected Gradient-Aligned Perturbations. Specifically, we first estimate a
low-dimensional gradient space and then align perturbations in projected
gradients' direction within the space. This approach enables reduced the number
of perturbed parameters and decreased variance, therefore accelerated
convergence for LLM fine-tuning. Experiments on LLMs show that P-GAP
consistently surpasses the baselines, achieving up to 6% increase in accuracy
on classification tasks and up to 12% higher accuracy on generation tasks, with
up to about 81% less training iterations and 70% less GPU hours. These results
demonstrate that P-GAP enables fast, scalable, and resource-efficient ZO LLM
fine-tuning.

Conclusion: ACTG-ARL框架有效解决了差分隐私文本生成的挑战，在质量和控制方面均优于现有方法

Abstract: Generating high-quality synthetic text under differential privacy (DP) is
critical for training and evaluating language models without compromising user
privacy. Prior work on synthesizing DP datasets often fail to preserve key
statistical attributes, suffer utility loss from the noise required by DP, and
lack fine-grained control over generation. To address these challenges, we make
two contributions. First, we introduce a hierarchical framework that decomposes
DP synthetic text generation into two subtasks: feature learning and
conditional text generation. This design explicitly incorporates learned
features into the generation process and simplifies the end-to-end synthesis
task. Through systematic ablations, we identify the most effective
configuration: a rich tabular schema as feature, a DP tabular synthesizer, and
a DP fine-tuned conditional generator, which we term ACTG
(Attribute-Conditioned Text Generation). Second, we propose Anchored RL (ARL),
a post-training method that improves the instruction-following ability of ACTG
for conditional generation. ARL combines RL to boost control with an SFT anchor
on best-of-$N$ data to prevent reward hacking. Together, these components form
our end-to-end algorithm ACTG-ARL, which advances both the quality of DP
synthetic text (+20% MAUVE over prior work) and the control of the conditional
generator under strong privacy guarantees.

Motivation: 当前AI/ML社会影响研究的评审标准倾向于同时认可部署和新方法创新，这可能导致研究人员忽视仅在一个方面（应用或方法）做出贡献但更符合合作伙伴需求的项目，从而损害更广泛社会影响研究生态系统的可持续性。

Method: 采用立场分析的方法，提出研究人员和评审者需要同时采纳两个关键原则：更广泛的社会影响概念（超越部署）和对部署系统影响的更严格评估。

Result: 识别了当前评审标准存在的问题，并提出了改进方向，但未提供具体的实证结果。

Conclusion: 为了促进AI/ML社会影响研究的可持续发展，研究社区需要重新思考评审标准，采纳更广泛的社会影响定义和更严格的部署系统影响评估方法。

Abstract: There has been increasing research interest in AI/ML for social impact, and
correspondingly more publication venues have refined review criteria for
practice-driven AI/ML research. However, these review guidelines tend to most
concretely recognize projects that simultaneously achieve deployment and novel
ML methodological innovation. We argue that this introduces incentives for
researchers that undermine the sustainability of a broader research ecosystem
of social impact, which benefits from projects that make contributions on
single front (applied or methodological) that may better meet project partner
needs. Our position is that researchers and reviewers in machine learning for
social impact must simultaneously adopt: 1) a more expansive conception of
social impacts beyond deployment and 2) more rigorous evaluations of the impact

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法假设实体内部和跨图对应都是完美的，但现实中的多模态知识图谱依赖专家标注，往往存在噪声对应问题。

Method: RULE通过两阶段原则估计对应可靠性，在属性融合时减轻实体内部噪声影响，在消除跨图差异时防止对噪声对应过拟合，并加入对应推理模块发现跨图的属性-属性连接。

Result: 在五个基准测试上的广泛实验表明，与七种最先进方法相比，RULE在解决DNC问题上具有显著效果。

Conclusion: RULE框架能有效处理多模态实体对齐中的双层级噪声对应问题，提高实体对齐的准确性。

Abstract: Multi-modal entity alignment (MMEA) aims to identify equivalent entities
across heterogeneous multi-modal knowledge graphs (MMKGs), where each entity is
described by attributes from various modalities. Existing methods typically
assume that both intra-entity and inter-graph correspondences are faultless,
which is often violated in real-world MMKGs due to the reliance on expert
annotations. In this paper, we reveal and study a highly practical yet
under-explored problem in MMEA, termed Dual-level Noisy Correspondence (DNC).
DNC refers to misalignments in both intra-entity (entity-attribute) and
inter-graph (entity-entity and attribute-attribute) correspondences. To address
the DNC problem, we propose a robust MMEA framework termed RULE. RULE first
estimates the reliability of both intra-entity and inter-graph correspondences
via a dedicated two-fold principle. Leveraging the estimated reliabilities,
RULE mitigates the negative impact of intra-entity noise during attribute
fusion and prevents overfitting to noisy inter-graph correspondences during
inter-graph discrepancy elimination. Beyond the training-time designs, RULE
further incorporates a correspondence reasoning module that uncovers the
underlying attribute-attribute connection across graphs, guaranteeing more
accurate equivalent entity identification. Extensive experiments on five
benchmarks verify the effectiveness of our method against the DNC compared with
seven state-of-the-art methods.The code is available at

TL;DR: 本文研究了大型语言模型架构因素（隐藏层大小、MLP与注意力参数分配比、分组查询注意力）对推理成本和准确性的影响，提出了条件缩放定律和搜索框架，训练了200多个模型验证方法有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大模型参数规模和训练数据量的增长，推理成本成为重要问题，但模型准确性与推理效率之间的权衡关系尚未充分探索。

Method: 引入条件缩放定律，在Chinchilla框架基础上加入架构信息，提出搜索框架来识别同时具备推理效率和准确性的架构，训练了80M到3B参数的200多个模型进行验证。

Result: 条件缩放定律能可靠预测最优架构选择，优化后的模型在相同训练预算下比LLaMA-3.2准确率提升2.1%，推理吞吐量提升42%。

Conclusion: 通过优化架构因素可以在保持准确性的同时显著提升推理效率，为构建更高效的大语言模型提供了有效方法。

Abstract: Scaling the number of parameters and the size of training data has proven to
be an effective strategy for improving large language model (LLM) performance.
Yet, as these models grow increasingly powerful and widely deployed, the cost
of inference has become a pressing concern. Despite its importance, the
trade-off between model accuracy and inference efficiency remains
underexplored. In this work, we examine how key architectural factors, hidden
size, the allocation of parameters between MLP and attention (mlp-to-attention
ratio), and grouped-query attention (GQA), influence both inference cost and
accuracy. We introduce a conditional scaling law that augments the Chinchilla
framework with architectural information, along with a search framework for
identifying architectures that are simultaneously inference-efficient and
accurate. To validate our approach, we train more than 200 models spanning 80M
to 3B parameters and 8B to 100B training tokens, and fit the proposed
conditional scaling law. Our results show that the conditional scaling law
reliably predicts optimal architectural choices and that the resulting models
outperform existing open-source baselines. Under the same training budget,
optimized architectures achieve up to 2.1% higher accuracy and 42% greater
inference throughput compared to LLaMA-3.2.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多任务学习中任务不平衡是一个主要挑战，虽然平衡不同任务的收敛速度是有效方法，但在复杂的MTL系统中准确表征多个任务的训练动态和收敛速度非常困难。

Method: 利用神经正切核理论分析MTL训练动态，引入扩展的NTK矩阵，采用谱分析来平衡多个任务的收敛速度，并基于共享表示近似提出NTKMTL-SR以提高训练效率。

Result: 在多个基准测试中（包括多任务监督学习和多任务强化学习）实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 提出的NTKMTL方法通过NTK理论有效解决了MTL中的任务不平衡问题，在保持竞争力的同时提高了训练效率。

Abstract: Multi-Task Learning (MTL) enables a single model to learn multiple tasks
simultaneously, leveraging knowledge transfer among tasks for enhanced
generalization, and has been widely applied across various domains. However,
task imbalance remains a major challenge in MTL. Although balancing the
convergence speeds of different tasks is an effective approach to address this
issue, it is highly challenging to accurately characterize the training
dynamics and convergence speeds of multiple tasks within the complex MTL
system. To this end, we attempt to analyze the training dynamics in MTL by
leveraging Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) theory and propose a new MTL method,
NTKMTL. Specifically, we introduce an extended NTK matrix for MTL and adopt
spectral analysis to balance the convergence speeds of multiple tasks, thereby
mitigating task imbalance. Based on the approximation via shared
representation, we further propose NTKMTL-SR, achieving training efficiency
while maintaining competitive performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our methods achieve state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of
benchmarks, including both multi-task supervised learning and multi-task
reinforcement learning. Source code is available at

TL;DR: 提出Customized-GRPO框架，通过Synergy-Aware Reward Shaping和Time-Aware Dynamic Weighting解决主题驱动图像生成中身份保持与提示遵循的竞争退化问题


<details>

Motivation: 解决主题驱动图像生成模型中身份保持（保真度）与提示遵循（可编辑性）之间的基本权衡问题，发现简单的GRPO应用会导致竞争退化

Method: 提出Customized-GRPO框架，包含两个关键创新：1) Synergy-Aware Reward Shaping - 非线性机制惩罚冲突奖励信号并放大协同信号；2) Time-Aware Dynamic Weighting - 根据扩散过程时间动态调整优化压力

Result: 方法显著优于朴素GRPO基线，成功缓解竞争退化，在保持关键身份特征的同时准确遵循复杂文本提示

Conclusion: Customized-GRPO框架实现了身份保持与提示遵循的优越平衡，生成图像既保留关键身份特征又准确遵循复杂文本提示

Abstract: Subject-driven image generation models face a fundamental trade-off between
identity preservation (fidelity) and prompt adherence (editability). While
online reinforcement learning (RL), specifically GPRO, offers a promising
solution, we find that a naive application of GRPO leads to competitive
degradation, as the simple linear aggregation of rewards with static weights
causes conflicting gradient signals and a misalignment with the temporal
dynamics of the diffusion process. To overcome these limitations, we propose
Customized-GRPO, a novel framework featuring two key innovations: (i)
Synergy-Aware Reward Shaping (SARS), a non-linear mechanism that explicitly
penalizes conflicted reward signals and amplifies synergistic ones, providing a
sharper and more decisive gradient. (ii) Time-Aware Dynamic Weighting (TDW),
which aligns the optimization pressure with the model's temporal dynamics by
prioritizing prompt-following in the early, identity preservation in the later.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms
naive GRPO baselines, successfully mitigating competitive degradation. Our
model achieves a superior balance, generating images that both preserve key
identity features and accurately adhere to complex textual prompts.

Conclusion: TOT框架能够有效处理在线时间序列预测中的分布漂移问题，通过引入潜在变量提升预测性能，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: This paper is concerned with online time series forecasting, where unknown
distribution shifts occur over time, i.e., latent variables influence the
mapping from historical to future observations. To develop an automated way of
online time series forecasting, we propose a Theoretical framework for Online
Time-series forecasting (TOT in short) with theoretical guarantees.
Specifically, we prove that supplying a forecaster with latent variables
tightens the Bayes risk, the benefit endures under estimation uncertainty of
latent variables and grows as the latent variables achieve a more precise
identifiability. To better introduce latent variables into online forecasting
algorithms, we further propose to identify latent variables with minimal
adjacent observations. Based on these results, we devise a model-agnostic
blueprint by employing a temporal decoder to match the distribution of observed
variables and two independent noise estimators to model the causal inference of
latent variables and mixing procedures of observed variables, respectively.
Experiment results on synthetic data support our theoretical claims. Moreover,
plug-in implementations built on several baselines yield general improvement
across multiple benchmarks, highlighting the effectiveness in real-world
applications.

Method: pretc从随机探索开始，然后根据估计的奖励函数选择最优波束；prgreedy在线估计并选择当前最优波束。两种算法都将每条路径参数视为黑盒，基于历史采样奖励维护最优估计。

Result: 在合成DeepMIMO数据集和真实DeepSense6G数据集上的实验表明，两种算法在多种信道环境下都优于现有方法，显示出良好的泛化性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 基于毫米波信道稀疏多径特性的物理信息bandit算法能有效解决波束对准问题，无需依赖不现实的奖励函数结构假设，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: In millimeter wave (mmWave) communications, beam alignment and tracking are
crucial to combat the significant path loss. As scanning the entire directional
space is inefficient, designing an efficient and robust method to identify the
optimal beam directions is essential. Since traditional bandit algorithms
require a long time horizon to converge under large beam spaces, many existing
works propose efficient bandit algorithms for beam alignment by relying on
unimodality or multimodality assumptions on the reward function's structure.
However, such assumptions often do not hold (or cannot be strictly satisfied)
in practice, which causes such algorithms to converge to choosing suboptimal
beams.
  In this work, we propose two physics-informed bandit algorithms
\textit{pretc} and \textit{prgreedy} that exploit the sparse multipath property
of mmWave channels - a generic but realistic assumption - which is connected to
the Phase Retrieval Bandit problem. Our algorithms treat the parameters of each
path as black boxes and maintain optimal estimates of them based on sampled
historical rewards. \textit{pretc} starts with a random exploration phase and
then commits to the optimal beam under the estimated reward function.
\textit{prgreedy} performs such estimation in an online manner and chooses the
best beam under current estimates. Our algorithms can also be easily adapted to
beam tracking in the mobile setting. Through experiments using both the
synthetic DeepMIMO dataset and the real-world DeepSense6G dataset, we
demonstrate that both algorithms outperform existing approaches in a wide range
of scenarios across diverse channel environments, showing their
generalizability and robustness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有时间因果表示学习方法无法捕捉真实世界任务中多级抽象的时间依赖关系，因为它们无法从单时间步观测变量恢复分层潜在变量的联合分布。

Method: 使用三个条件独立观测来确定分层潜在变量的联合分布，利用分层结构的自然稀疏性识别各层潜在变量，并开发基于变分推理的时间序列生成模型。

Result: 在合成和真实世界数据集上的实证评估验证了理论主张，证明了CHiLD在建模分层潜在动态方面的有效性。

Conclusion: CHiLD框架能够唯一确定分层潜在变量的联合分布，为建模多级抽象的时间依赖关系提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Modeling hierarchical latent dynamics behind time series data is critical for
capturing temporal dependencies across multiple levels of abstraction in
real-world tasks. However, existing temporal causal representation learning
methods fail to capture such dynamics, as they fail to recover the joint
distribution of hierarchical latent variables from \textit{single-timestep
observed variables}. Interestingly, we find that the joint distribution of
hierarchical latent variables can be uniquely determined using three
conditionally independent observations. Building on this insight, we propose a
Causally Hierarchical Latent Dynamic (CHiLD) identification framework. Our
approach first employs temporal contextual observed variables to identify the
joint distribution of multi-layer latent variables. Sequentially, we exploit
the natural sparsity of the hierarchical structure among latent variables to
identify latent variables within each layer. Guided by the theoretical results,
we develop a time series generative model grounded in variational inference.
This model incorporates a contextual encoder to reconstruct multi-layer latent
variables and normalize flow-based hierarchical prior networks to impose the
independent noise condition of hierarchical latent dynamics. Empirical
evaluations on both synthetic and real-world datasets validate our theoretical
claims and demonstrate the effectiveness of CHiLD in modeling hierarchical
latent dynamics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索transformer在算法任务中如何构建内部世界模型，以及模型大小对表示质量的影响。

Method: 使用强化学习训练transformer执行冒泡排序式的相邻交换操作，通过数百次实验分析不同嵌入维度下的内部表示机制。

Result: 发现两个一致机制：(1)注意力权重矩阵最后一行单调编码token的全局排序；(2)选择的交换操作与这些编码值的最大相邻差异对齐。高嵌入维度增强了结构化内部表示的形成。

Conclusion: transformer会构建结构化的内部世界模型，模型大小不仅改善最终性能，还提高了表示质量，为类似算法任务的分析提供了可用的度量和分析方法。

Abstract: We investigate how embedding dimension affects the emergence of an internal
"world model" in a transformer trained with reinforcement learning to perform
bubble-sort-style adjacent swaps. Models achieve high accuracy even with very
small embedding dimensions, but larger dimensions yield more faithful,
consistent, and robust internal representations. In particular, higher
embedding dimensions strengthen the formation of structured internal
representation and lead to better interpretability. After hundreds of
experiments, we observe two consistent mechanisms: (1) the last row of the
attention weight matrix monotonically encodes the global ordering of tokens;
and (2) the selected transposition aligns with the largest adjacent difference
of these encoded values. Our results provide quantitative evidence that
transformers build structured internal world models and that model size
improves representation quality in addition to end performance. We release our
metrics and analyses, which can be used to probe similar algorithmic tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统EDL方法假设类别概率服从Dirichlet分布的限制性假设限制了其在复杂或意外情况下的鲁棒性，需要更灵活的不确定性表示方法。

Method: 通过预测灵活Dirichlet分布（Dirichlet分布的泛化）来扩展EDL，提供更具表达力和自适应性的不确定性表示。

Conclusion: F-EDL通过灵活Dirichlet分布显著增强了不确定性量化的泛化能力和可靠性，在挑战性场景下表现优异。

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification (UQ) is crucial for deploying machine learning
models in high-stakes applications, where overconfident predictions can lead to
serious consequences. An effective UQ method must balance computational
efficiency with the ability to generalize across diverse scenarios. Evidential
deep learning (EDL) achieves efficiency by modeling uncertainty through the
prediction of a Dirichlet distribution over class probabilities. However, the
restrictive assumption of Dirichlet-distributed class probabilities limits
EDL's robustness, particularly in complex or unforeseen situations. To address
this, we propose \textit{flexible evidential deep learning}
($\mathcal{F}$-EDL), which extends EDL by predicting a flexible Dirichlet
distribution -- a generalization of the Dirichlet distribution -- over class
probabilities. This approach provides a more expressive and adaptive
representation of uncertainty, significantly enhancing UQ generalization and
reliability under challenging scenarios. We theoretically establish several
advantages of $\mathcal{F}$-EDL and empirically demonstrate its
state-of-the-art UQ performance across diverse evaluation settings, including
classical, long-tailed, and noisy in-distribution scenarios.

Motivation: 现有连续时间模型（如DTE）在异常检测中推理成本过高，需要开发既保持高精度又具有轻量级推理的方法。

Method: TCCM学习向固定目标（原点）的时间条件收缩向量，无需训练和推理时求解常微分方程，使用单步偏差评分策略。

Conclusion: TCCM提供了一种可扩展、可解释且具有理论鲁棒性保证的异常检测方法，解决了现有连续时间模型的推理瓶颈问题。

Abstract: We introduce Time-Conditioned Contraction Matching (TCCM), a novel method for
semi-supervised anomaly detection in tabular data. TCCM is inspired by flow
matching, a recent generative modeling framework that learns velocity fields
between probability distributions and has shown strong performance compared to
diffusion models and generative adversarial networks. Instead of directly
applying flow matching as originally formulated, TCCM builds on its core idea
-- learning velocity fields between distributions -- but simplifies the
framework by predicting a time-conditioned contraction vector toward a fixed
target (the origin) at each sampled time step. This design offers three key
advantages: (1) a lightweight and scalable training objective that removes the
need for solving ordinary differential equations during training and inference;
(2) an efficient scoring strategy called one time-step deviation, which
quantifies deviation from expected contraction behavior in a single forward
pass, addressing the inference bottleneck of existing continuous-time models
such as DTE (a diffusion-based model with leading anomaly detection accuracy
but heavy inference cost); and (3) explainability and provable robustness, as
the learned velocity field operates directly in input space, making the anomaly
score inherently feature-wise attributable; moreover, the score function is
Lipschitz-continuous with respect to the input, providing theoretical
guarantees under small perturbations. Extensive experiments on the ADBench
benchmark show that TCCM strikes a favorable balance between detection accuracy
and inference cost, outperforming state-of-the-art methods -- especially on
high-dimensional and large-scale datasets. The source code is available at our
GitHub repository.

Abstract: The classical policy gradient method is the theoretical and conceptual
foundation of modern policy-based reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms. Most
rigorous analyses of such methods, particularly those establishing convergence
guarantees, assume a discount factor $\gamma < 1$. In contrast, however, a
recent line of work on policy-based RL for large language models uses the
undiscounted total-reward setting with $\gamma = 1$, rendering much of the
existing theory inapplicable. In this paper, we provide analyses of the policy
gradient method for undiscounted expected total-reward infinite-horizon MDPs
based on two key insights: (i) the classification of the MDP states into
recurrent and transient states is invariant over the set of policies that
assign strictly positive probability to every action (as is typical in deep RL
models employing a softmax output layer) and (ii) the classical state
visitation measure (which may be ill-defined when $\gamma = 1$) can be replaced
with a new object that we call the transient visitation measure.

Abstract: Understanding when learning is possible is a fundamental task in the theory
of machine learning. However, many characterizations known from the literature
deal with abstract learning as a mathematical object and ignore the crucial
question: when can learning be implemented as a computer program? We address
this question for universal online learning, a generalist theoretical model of
online binary classification, recently characterized by Bousquet et al.
(STOC'21). In this model, there is no hypothesis fixed in advance; instead,
Adversary -- playing the role of Nature -- can change their mind as long as
local consistency with the given class of hypotheses is maintained. We require
Learner to achieve a finite number of mistakes while using a strategy that can
be implemented as a computer program. We show that universal online learning
does not imply computable universal online learning, even if the class of
hypotheses is relatively easy from a computability-theoretic perspective. We
then study the agnostic variant of computable universal online learning and
provide an exact characterization of classes that are learnable in this sense.
We also consider a variant of proper universal online learning and show exactly
when it is possible. Together, our results give a more realistic perspective on
the existing theory of online binary classification and the related problem of
inductive inference.

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification (UQ) is essential for deploying deep neural
networks in safety-critical settings. Although methods like Deep Ensembles
achieve strong UQ performance, their high computational and memory costs hinder
scalability to large models. We introduce Hydra Ensembles, an efficient
transformer-based ensemble that prunes attention heads to create diverse
members and merges them via a new multi-head attention with grouped
fully-connected layers. This yields a compact model with inference speed close
to a single network, matching or surpassing Deep Ensembles in UQ performance
without retraining from scratch. We also provide an in-depth analysis of
pruning, showing that naive approaches can harm calibration, whereas Hydra
Ensembles preserves robust uncertainty. Experiments on image and text
classification tasks, with various architectures, show consistent gains over
Deep Ensembles. Remarkably, in zero-shot classification on ImageNet-1k, our
approach surpasses state of the art methods, even without requiring additional
training.

Conclusion: FGP方法能有效提升神经网络架构编码器性能，同时保持简单结构，解决了现有流基编码器速度慢的问题

Abstract: The performance of a deep learning model on a specific task and dataset
depends heavily on its neural architecture, motivating considerable efforts to
rapidly and accurately identify architectures suited to the target task and
dataset. To achieve this, researchers use machine learning models-typically
neural architecture encoders-to predict the performance of a neural
architecture. Many state-of-the-art encoders aim to capture information flow
within a neural architecture, which reflects how information moves through the
forward pass and backpropagation, via a specialized model structure. However,
due to their complicated structures, these flow-based encoders are
significantly slower to process neural architectures compared to simpler
encoders, presenting a notable practical challenge. To address this, we propose
FGP, a novel pre-training method for neural architecture encoding that trains
an encoder to capture the information flow without requiring specialized model
structures. FGP trains an encoder to reconstruct a flow surrogate, our proposed
representation of the neural architecture's information flow. Our experiments
show that FGP boosts encoder performance by up to 106% in Precision-1%,
compared to the same encoder trained solely with supervised learning.

Motivation: 现有的图域自适应模型主要关注闭集设置，假设源域和目标域共享相同的标签空间。但在现实场景中，目标域可能包含源域中不存在的类别，因此需要研究开放集图域自适应问题。

Method: GraphRTA框架在图和模型两侧进行重编程：通过修改目标图结构和节点特征实现图重编程，促进已知和未知类别的更好分离；通过剪枝领域特定参数实现模型重编程，减少对源图的偏见同时保留可迁移模式；扩展分类器增加未知类维度，无需手动设定阈值。

Result: 在多个公共数据集上的综合实验表明，与现有最先进基线方法相比，所提模型能够取得满意的性能。

Conclusion: GraphRTA框架有效解决了开放集图域自适应问题，能够正确分类目标节点到已知类别，同时识别源域未见节点类型为未知类。

Abstract: Unsupervised Graph Domain Adaptation has become a promising paradigm for
transferring knowledge from a fully labeled source graph to an unlabeled target
graph. Existing graph domain adaptation models primarily focus on the
closed-set setting, where the source and target domains share the same label
spaces. However, this assumption might not be practical in the real-world
scenarios, as the target domain might include classes that are not present in
the source domain. In this paper, we investigate the problem of unsupervised
open-set graph domain adaptation, where the goal is to not only correctly
classify target nodes into the known classes, but also recognize previously
unseen node types into the unknown class. Towards this end, we propose a novel
framework called GraphRTA, which conducts reprogramming on both the graph and
model sides. Specifically, we reprogram the graph by modifying target graph
structure and node features, which facilitates better separation of known and
unknown classes. Meanwhile, we also perform model reprogramming by pruning
domain-specific parameters to reduce bias towards the source graph while
preserving parameters that capture transferable patterns across graphs.
Additionally, we extend the classifier with an extra dimension for the unknown
class, thus eliminating the need of manually specified threshold in open-set
recognition. Comprehensive experiments on several public datasets demonstrate
that our proposed model can achieve satisfied performance compared with recent
state-of-the-art baselines. Our source codes and datasets are publicly
available at https://github.com/cszhangzhen/GraphRTA.

Motivation: 单个GNN的性能受限于真实世界图的异质性，而集成多个具有不同泛化模式的GNN可以显著提升性能。

Method: 评估了20种多样化策略，包括随机重新初始化、超参数调优、架构变化、方向性建模和训练数据分区等，在14个节点分类基准上构建了200多个集成变体。

Result: 通过全面评估每种技术在专家多样性、互补性和集成性能方面的表现，揭示了训练最大多样性专家的机制性见解。

Conclusion: 这些发现为专家训练和在图数据上设计有效的MoE框架提供了可操作的指导。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become essential tools for learning on
relational data, yet the performance of a single GNN is often limited by the
heterogeneity present in real-world graphs. Recent advances in
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) frameworks demonstrate that assembling multiple,
explicitly diverse GNNs with distinct generalization patterns can significantly
improve performance. In this work, we present the first systematic empirical
study of expert-level diversification techniques for GNN ensembles. Evaluating
20 diversification strategies -- including random re-initialization,
hyperparameter tuning, architectural variation, directionality modeling, and
training data partitioning -- across 14 node classification benchmarks, we
construct and analyze over 200 ensemble variants. Our comprehensive evaluation
examines each technique in terms of expert diversity, complementarity, and
ensemble performance. We also uncovers mechanistic insights into training
maximally diverse experts. These findings provide actionable guidance for
expert training and the design of effective MoE frameworks on graph data. Our

Motivation: 研究浅层神经网络在Barron函数空间中的逼近能力，特别是激活函数为指数函数幂次时的性能，以理解维度灾难和网络结构选择的影响。

Method: 分析ReLU^k激活函数的逼近率，证明在ℓ^1有界系数或光滑度不足条件下无法达到最优逼近率，并在各种范数下建立Barron空间和Sobolev空间的最优逼近率。

focuses on the dependence of the approximation rate on the dimension and the
smoothness of the function being approximated within the Barron function space.
We examine the approximation rates of ReLU$^{k}$ activation functions, proving
that the optimal rate cannot be achieved under $\ell^{1}$-bounded coefficients
or insufficient smoothness conditions.
  We also establish optimal approximation rates in various norms for functions
in Barron spaces and Sobolev spaces, confirming the curse of dimensionality.
Our results clarify the limits of shallow neural networks' approximation
capabilities and offer insights into the selection of activation functions and
network structures.

*Miao Zhang,Junpeng Li,ChangChun HUa,Yana Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种针对NTMP（N元组包含M个正例）弱监督学习的新方法，通过元组计数构建可训练的无偏风险估计器，在仅有计数监督的情况下有效学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 弱监督学习通常使用聚合信号而非实例标签。NTMP监督设置中，每个训练示例是一个包含恰好m个正例的n元组，但只观察到每组的计数m。这种设置出现在图像分类的区域提议和多实例测量等场景中。

Method: 通过将元组生成过程与潜在实例边际联系起来，推导出闭式无偏风险估计器（URE），并扩展到可变元组大小、可变计数及其组合。引入ReLU校正来提高有限样本稳定性，同时保持渐近正确性。

Result: 在转换为NTMP任务的基准测试中，该方法持续优于代表性的弱监督基线，产生有利的精确率-召回率和F1权衡。在类别先验不平衡和多样化元组配置下保持稳健。

Conclusion: 计数监督可以通过理论严谨且实际稳定的目标有效利用，证明了仅凭计数监督在弱监督学习中的有效性。

Abstract: Weakly supervised learning often operates with coarse aggregate signals
rather than instance labels. We study a setting where each training example is
an $n$-tuple containing exactly m positives, while only the count m per tuple
is observed. This NTMP (N-tuple with M positives) supervision arises in, e.g.,
image classification with region proposals and multi-instance measurements. We
show that tuple counts admit a trainable unbiased risk estimator (URE) by
linking the tuple-generation process to latent instance marginals. Starting
from fixed (n,m), we derive a closed-form URE and extend it to variable tuple
sizes, variable counts, and their combination. Identification holds whenever
the effective mixing rate is separated from the class prior. We establish
generalization bounds via Rademacher complexity and prove statistical
consistency with standard rates under mild regularity assumptions. To improve
finite-sample stability, we introduce simple ReLU corrections to the URE that
preserve asymptotic correctness. Across benchmarks converted to NTMP tasks, the
approach consistently outperforms representative weak-supervision baselines and
yields favorable precision-recall and F1 trade-offs. It remains robust under
class-prior imbalance and across diverse tuple configurations, demonstrating
that count-only supervision can be exploited effectively through a
theoretically grounded and practically stable objective.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络容易过拟合，需要更有效的正则化方法来提升泛化性能。

Method: MAGDrop方法动态调整激活层的dropout率，基于当前梯度和累积动量，在非凸优化中增强稳定性。

Result: 在MNIST和CIFAR-10上分别达到99.52%和90.63%的测试准确率，比基线方法提升1-2%，泛化差距分别为0.48%和7.14%。

Conclusion: MAGDrop通过理论分析和实验验证，为提升DNN泛化能力提供了稳健框架，适用于高风险应用场景。

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) achieve remarkable performance but often suffer
from overfitting due to their high capacity. We introduce Momentum-Adaptive
Gradient Dropout (MAGDrop), a novel regularization method that dynamically
adjusts dropout rates on activations based on current gradients and accumulated
momentum, enhancing stability in non-convex optimization landscapes. To
theoretically justify MAGDrop's effectiveness, we derive a tightened PAC-Bayes
generalization bound that accounts for its adaptive nature, achieving up to 20%
sharper bounds compared to standard approaches by leveraging momentum-driven
perturbation control. Empirically, the activation-based MAGDrop outperforms
baseline regularization techniques, including standard dropout and adaptive
gradient regularization, by 1-2% in test accuracy on MNIST (99.52%) and
CIFAR-10 (90.63%), with generalization gaps of 0.48% and 7.14%, respectively.
Our work bridges theoretical insights and practical advancements, offering a
robust framework for enhancing DNN generalization suitable for high-stakes
applications.

Motivation: 解决高维多模态非归一化概率分布采样中的模式崩溃和质量传输问题，特别是玻尔兹曼分布采样中的挑战。

Method: 引入约束质量传输(CMT)框架，在连续步骤间同时约束KL散度和熵衰减，增强分布重叠，减轻质量传输，防止过早收敛。

Result: 在标准基准测试和新引入的ELIL四肽系统上，CMT持续超越最先进的变分方法，有效样本量提高2.5倍以上且避免模式崩溃。

Conclusion: CMT框架通过约束KL散度和熵衰减，显著改善了玻尔兹曼生成器的采样性能，为高维多模态分布采样提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Efficient sampling from high-dimensional and multimodal unnormalized
probability distributions is a central challenge in many areas of science and
machine learning. We focus on Boltzmann generators (BGs) that aim to sample the
Boltzmann distribution of physical systems, such as molecules, at a given
temperature. Classical variational approaches that minimize the reverse
Kullback-Leibler divergence are prone to mode collapse, while annealing-based
methods, commonly using geometric schedules, can suffer from mass teleportation
and rely heavily on schedule tuning. We introduce Constrained Mass Transport
(CMT), a variational framework that generates intermediate distributions under
constraints on both the KL divergence and the entropy decay between successive
steps. These constraints enhance distributional overlap, mitigate mass
teleportation, and counteract premature convergence. Across standard BG
benchmarks and the here introduced ELIL tetrapeptide, the largest system
studied to date without access to samples from molecular dynamics, CMT
consistently surpasses state-of-the-art variational methods, achieving more
than 2.5x higher effective sample size while avoiding mode collapse.

Motivation: 现有异质时序图学习方法采用解耦的时空学习范式，削弱了时空信息交互并导致模型复杂度高，需要一种更高效的集成学习范式。

Method: 通过动态注意力机制将时序建模整合到空间学习中，保留历史图快照的注意力信息指导后续计算；同时利用大语言模型捕获节点类型的隐式属性作为先验知识。

Result: 在广泛实验中，SE-HTGNN相比最先进的基线方法实现了高达10倍的加速，同时保持了最佳的预测精度。

Conclusion: SE-HTGNN通过创新的时空集成学习范式和大语言模型的先验知识利用，为异质时序图学习提供了高效且准确的解决方案。

Abstract: Heterogeneous temporal graphs (HTGs) are ubiquitous data structures in the
real world. Recently, to enhance representation learning on HTGs, numerous
attention-based neural networks have been proposed. Despite these successes,
existing methods rely on a decoupled temporal and spatial learning paradigm,
which weakens interactions of spatio-temporal information and leads to a high
model complexity. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel learning paradigm for
HTGs called Simple and Efficient Heterogeneous Temporal Graph N}eural Network
(SE-HTGNN). Specifically, we innovatively integrate temporal modeling into
spatial learning via a novel dynamic attention mechanism, which retains
attention information from historical graph snapshots to guide subsequent
attention computation, thereby improving the overall discriminative
representations learning of HTGs. Additionally, to comprehensively and
adaptively understand HTGs, we leverage large language models to prompt
SE-HTGNN, enabling the model to capture the implicit properties of node types
as prior knowledge. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SE-HTGNN achieves up
to 10x speed-up over the state-of-the-art and latest baseline while maintaining
the best forecasting accuracy.

TL;DR: 该论文对知识图谱上的公平性感知图神经网络进行了基准测试研究，发现在知识图谱上存在更明显的准确性与公平性权衡，且性能受GNN主干网络和早停条件影响显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的公平性感知GNN研究未在知识图谱上进行评估，而知识图谱是推荐系统等应用中的重要图结构数据，因此需要填补这一研究空白。

Method: 从YAGO、DBpedia和Wikidata三个知识图谱生成新图，在比现有公平性研究数据集更大的图上，对预处理和过程中处理方法在不同GNN主干网络和早停条件下进行基准测试。

Result: 发现知识图谱与其他图数据相比显示出不同趋势：在公平性感知GNN中准确性与公平性指标之间存在更清晰的权衡；性能不仅受公平性感知GNN方法影响，还受GNN主干网络和早停条件影响；预处理方法通常改善公平性指标，而过程中处理方法改善预测准确性。

Conclusion: 知识图谱上的公平性研究显示出独特的特征，需要专门考虑GNN架构和训练策略对公平性的影响，预处理和过程中处理方法在公平性与准确性方面各有优势。

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) are powerful tools for learning from
graph-structured data but often produce biased predictions with respect to
sensitive attributes. Fairness-aware GNNs have been actively studied for
mitigating biased predictions. However, no prior studies have evaluated
fairness-aware GNNs on knowledge graphs, which are one of the most important
graphs in many applications, such as recommender systems. Therefore, we
introduce a benchmarking study on knowledge graphs. We generate new graphs from
three knowledge graphs, YAGO, DBpedia, and Wikidata, that are significantly
larger than the existing graph datasets used in fairness studies. We benchmark
inprocessing and preprocessing methods in different GNN backbones and early
stopping conditions. We find several key insights: (i) knowledge graphs show
different trends from existing datasets; clearer trade-offs between prediction
accuracy and fairness metrics than other graphs in fairness-aware GNNs, (ii)
the performance is largely affected by not only fairness-aware GNN methods but
also GNN backbones and early stopping conditions, and (iii) preprocessing
methods often improve fairness metrics, while inprocessing methods improve
prediction accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以平衡强化学习的安全性与任务性能：严格的安全约束会损害性能，而优先奖励的方法则频繁违反安全约束，产生平坦的成本梯度阻碍策略改进。

Method: 引入不确定安全评论家(USC)，将不确定性感知调制和精炼集成到评论家训练中，在不确定和高成本区域集中保守性，同时在安全区域保持锐利梯度。

Result: USC将安全违规减少约40%，同时保持竞争力或更高的奖励，预测与真实成本梯度之间的误差减少约83%。

Conclusion: USC打破了安全与性能之间的普遍权衡，为可扩展的安全强化学习铺平了道路。

Abstract: Ensuring the safe exploration of reinforcement learning (RL) agents is
critical for deployment in real-world systems. Yet existing approaches struggle
to strike the right balance: methods that tightly enforce safety often cripple
task performance, while those that prioritize reward leave safety constraints
frequently violated, producing diffuse cost landscapes that flatten gradients
and stall policy improvement. We introduce the Uncertain Safety Critic (USC), a
novel approach that integrates uncertainty-aware modulation and refinement into
critic training. By concentrating conservatism in uncertain and costly regions
while preserving sharp gradients in safe areas, USC enables policies to achieve
effective reward-safety trade-offs. Extensive experiments show that USC reduces
safety violations by approximately 40% while maintaining competitive or higher
rewards, and reduces the error between predicted and true cost gradients by
approximately 83%, breaking the prevailing trade-off between safety and
performance and paving the way for scalable safe RL.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在安全关键环境中，可靠的导航需要准确的危险感知和原则性的不确定性处理，以增强下游安全处理能力。现有方法假设完美的危险检测能力，而不确定性感知的感知方法缺乏有限样本保证。

Method: 提出COPPOL方法，通过符合性预测将分布无关的有限样本安全保证集成到语义分割中，生成具有严格漏检界限的校准危险地图，这些地图为下游RL规划诱导风险感知成本场。

Result: 在两个卫星衍生基准测试中，COPPOL相比基线方法将危险覆盖率提高了6倍，实现了对不安全区域的近乎完全检测，同时将导航过程中的危险违规减少了约50%。

Conclusion: COPPOL方法对分布偏移保持稳健，同时保持了安全性和效率，为安全关键导航提供了可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Reliable navigation in safety-critical environments requires both accurate
hazard perception and principled uncertainty handling to strengthen downstream
safety handling. Despite the effectiveness of existing approaches, they assume
perfect hazard detection capabilities, while uncertainty-aware perception
approaches lack finite-sample guarantees. We present COPPOL, a conformal-driven
perception-to-policy learning approach that integrates distribution-free,
finite-sample safety guarantees into semantic segmentation, yielding calibrated
hazard maps with rigorous bounds for missed detections. These maps induce
risk-aware cost fields for downstream RL planning. Across two satellite-derived
benchmarks, COPPOL increases hazard coverage (up to 6x) compared to comparative
baselines, achieving near-complete detection of unsafe regions while reducing
hazardous violations during navigation (up to approx 50%). More importantly,
our approach remains robust to distributional shift, preserving both safety and
efficiency.

Motivation: 传统ROC分析无法捕捉医院患者监测警报系统部署中的关键因素，如最小精度约束（避免误报疲劳）和预测阳性数量上限（反映医院人员容量），且AUC指标不能反映假阳性和假阴性的不对称成本。

Method: 展示了如何在ROC空间中表示满足精度和容量约束的分类器子集，建立了该可行区域的几何结构，定义了部分较差分类器面积作为性能指标，并通过对期望成本参数范围求平均得到部分VOROS。

Conclusion: 提出的部分VOROS方法能够有效解决医院警报系统中的精度约束、容量限制和不对称成本问题，为这类应用提供了更好的分类器评估框架。

Abstract: The ROC curve is widely used to assess binary classification performance. Yet
for some applications such as alert systems for hospitalized patient
monitoring, conventional ROC analysis cannot capture crucial factors that
impact deployment, such as enforcing a minimum precision constraint to avoid
false alarm fatigue or imposing an upper bound on the number of predicted
positives to represent the capacity of hospital staff. The usual area under the
curve metric also does not reflect asymmetric costs for false positives and
false negatives. In this paper we address all three of these issues. First, we
show how the subset of classifiers that meet given precision and capacity
constraints can be represented as a feasible region in ROC space. We establish
the geometry of this feasible region. We then define the partial area of lesser
classifiers, a performance metric that is monotonic with cost and only accounts
for the feasible portion of ROC space. Averaging this area over a desired range
of cost parameters results in the partial volume over the ROC surface, or
partial VOROS. In experiments predicting mortality risk using vital sign
history on the MIMIC-IV dataset, we show this cost-aware metric is better than
alternatives for ranking classifiers in hospital alert applications.

Motivation: 由于教师模型可能来自不可信方，知识蒸馏可能带来意想不到的安全风险。现有LLM后门方法选择的触发词在常规语境中很少出现，低估了知识蒸馏的安全风险。

Method: 提出T-MTB后门技术，构建由多个特定令牌组成的复合后门触发器，这些令牌在预期的蒸馏数据集中经常单独出现，使得后门可以在蒸馏过程中转移到学生模型。

Result: 使用T-MTB在四种LLM模型家族中成功实现了可转移后门，在越狱和内容调节两种攻击场景中均有效，证明了知识蒸馏安全风险的严重性。

Conclusion: 知识蒸馏从后门教师模型存在严重安全风险，T-MTB技术能够构建可转移的后门，需要重新评估知识蒸馏的安全性并开发相应的防御措施。

Abstract: LLMs are often used by downstream users as teacher models for knowledge
distillation, compressing their capabilities into memory-efficient models.
However, as these teacher models may stem from untrusted parties, distillation
can raise unexpected security risks. In this paper, we investigate the security
implications of knowledge distillation from backdoored teacher models. First,
we show that prior backdoors mostly do not transfer onto student models. Our
key insight is that this is because existing LLM backdooring methods choose
trigger tokens that rarely occur in usual contexts. We argue that this
underestimates the security risks of knowledge distillation and introduce a new
backdooring technique, T-MTB, that enables the construction and study of
transferable backdoors. T-MTB carefully constructs a composite backdoor
trigger, made up of several specific tokens that often occur individually in
anticipated distillation datasets. As such, the poisoned teacher remains
stealthy, while during distillation the individual presence of these tokens
provides enough signal for the backdoor to transfer onto the student. Using
T-MTB, we demonstrate and extensively study the security risks of transferable
backdoors across two attack scenarios, jailbreaking and content modulation, and
across four model families of LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI系统进入高风险领域，评估需要超越预测准确性，涵盖可解释性、公平性、鲁棒性和可持续性等维度。

Method: 引入RAISE统一框架，量化模型在四个维度的性能，并聚合成整体责任分数。评估了三种深度学习模型：MLP、Tabular ResNet和Feature Tokenizer Transformer，在金融、医疗和社会经济结构化数据集上的表现。

Result: 发现关键权衡：MLP在可持续性和鲁棒性方面表现强劲；Transformer在可解释性和公平性方面表现出色但环境成本极高；Tabular ResNet提供平衡的性能特征。

Conclusion: 没有单一模型在所有责任标准上都占主导地位，强调了多维评估对于负责任模型选择的必要性。

Abstract: As AI systems enter high-stakes domains, evaluation must extend beyond
predictive accuracy to include explainability, fairness, robustness, and
sustainability. We introduce RAISE (Responsible AI Scoring and Evaluation), a
unified framework that quantifies model performance across these four
dimensions and aggregates them into a single, holistic Responsibility Score. We
evaluated three deep learning models: a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), a Tabular
ResNet, and a Feature Tokenizer Transformer, on structured datasets from
finance, healthcare, and socioeconomics. Our findings reveal critical
trade-offs: the MLP demonstrated strong sustainability and robustness, the
Transformer excelled in explainability and fairness at a very high
environmental cost, and the Tabular ResNet offered a balanced profile. These
results underscore that no single model dominates across all responsibility
criteria, highlighting the necessity of multi-dimensional evaluation for
responsible model selection. Our implementation is available at:

prone to premature convergence and may fail to capture subtle yet informative
features. This limitation becomes especially critical in high-dimensional
datasets, where complex and interdependent feature relationships prevail. We
introduce the HeFS (Helper-Enhanced Feature Selection) framework to refine
feature subsets produced by existing algorithms. HeFS systematically searches
the residual feature space to identify a Helper Set - features that complement
the original subset and improve classification performance. The approach
employs a biased initialization scheme and a ratio-guided mutation mechanism
within a genetic algorithm, coupled with Pareto-based multi-objective
optimization to jointly maximize predictive accuracy and feature
complementarity. Experiments on 18 benchmark datasets demonstrate that HeFS
consistently identifies overlooked yet informative features and achieves
superior performance over state-of-the-art methods, including in challenging
domains such as gastric cancer classification, drug toxicity prediction, and
computer science applications. The code and datasets are available at

Motivation: 现有图神经网络对抗攻击检测技术依赖强大的约束求解器（如混合整数规划），计算成本高，需要更高效的解决方案

Result: 在多种GNN变体和数据集上评估RobLight，显示出对现有技术的改进

Conclusion: 通过部分求解器可以显著提高图神经网络结构鲁棒性检测的效率，同时保持良好性能

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) are the predominant architecture for learning
over graphs. As with any machine learning model, and important issue is the
detection of adversarial attacks, where an adversary can change the output with
a small perturbation of the input. Techniques for solving the adversarial
robustness problem - determining whether such an attack exists - were
originally developed for image classification, but there are variants for many
other machine learning architectures. In the case of graph learning, the attack
model usually considers changes to the graph structure in addition to or
instead of the numerical features of the input, and the state of the art
techniques in the area proceed via reduction to constraint solving, working on
top of powerful solvers, e.g. for mixed integer programming. We show that it is
possible to improve on the state of the art in structural robustness by
replacing the use of powerful solvers by calls to efficient partial solvers,
which run in polynomial time but may be incomplete. We evaluate our tool
RobLight on a diverse set of GNN variants and datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SINDy方法在处理时间稀疏采样数据时存在局限性，由于局部截断误差较大而无法恢复正确的方程参数

Method: 采用展开方案改进显式方法的稳定性，通过迭代闭式方法或梯度下降方案实现，支持不同数值格式（欧拉、RK4）

Result: 实验表明该方法具有通用性，在传统SINDy和先进的iNeuralSINDy上都能解决非展开方法无法处理的问题

Conclusion: Unrolled-SINDy通过解耦数值步长与采样率，显著提升了稀疏时间采样数据下PDE发现的稳定性和准确性

Abstract: Identifying from observation data the governing differential equations of a
physical dynamics is a key challenge in machine learning. Although approaches
based on SINDy have shown great promise in this area, they still fail to
address a whole class of real world problems where the data is sparsely sampled
in time. In this article, we introduce Unrolled-SINDy, a simple methodology
that leverages an unrolling scheme to improve the stability of explicit methods
for PDE discovery. By decorrelating the numerical time step size from the
sampling rate of the available data, our approach enables the recovery of
equation parameters that would not be the minimizers of the original SINDy
optimization problem due to large local truncation errors. Our method can be
exploited either through an iterative closed-form approach or by a gradient
descent scheme. Experiments show the versatility of our method. On both
traditional SINDy and state-of-the-art noise-robust iNeuralSINDy, with
different numerical schemes (Euler, RK4), our proposed unrolling scheme allows
to tackle problems not accessible to non-unrolled methods.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了在下一个符号预测(NSP)设置下语言的可学习性，发现尽管NSP提供了比传统分类更丰富的标签信息，但学习DFA和布尔公式等概念类仍然是计算困难的。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NSP设置已被用于实证分析神经序列模型，且高效的NSP算法可用于学习语言模型的截断支持。论文旨在使该设置适用于PAC学习分析。

Method: 通过构造使几乎所有额外标签变得无用，从而将传统学习问题归约到NSP标签学习问题。

Result: 在密码学假设下，证明在NSP设置中学习DFA是计算困难的。

Conclusion: 虽然NSP提供了更丰富的监督信号，但并未显著降低学习某些概念类的计算复杂度。

Abstract: We study the learnability of languages in the Next Symbol Prediction (NSP)
setting, where a learner receives only positive examples from a language
together with, for every prefix, (i) whether the prefix itself is in the
language and (ii) which next symbols can lead to an accepting string. This
setting has been used in prior works to empirically analyze neural sequence
models, and additionally, we observe that efficient algorithms for the NSP
setting can be used to learn the (truncated) support of language models. We
formalize the setting so as to make it amenable to PAC-learning analysis. While
the setting provides a much richer set of labels than the conventional
classification setting, we show that learning concept classes such as DFAs and
Boolean formulas remains computationally hard. The proof is via a construction
that makes almost all additional labels uninformative, yielding a reduction
from the conventional learning problem to learning with NSP labels. Under
cryptographic assumptions, the reduction implies that the problem of learning
DFAs is computationally hard in the NSP setting.

Conclusion: 揭示了单层线性自注意力在表示结构化动态函数方面的基本限制，多层模型能够通过预条件梯度下降处理更复杂的优化目标，这些理论结果通过简化Transformer得到数值验证。

Abstract: Transformer architectures can solve unseen tasks based on input-output pairs
in a given prompt due to in-context learning (ICL). Existing theoretical
studies on ICL have mainly focused on linear regression tasks, often with
i.i.d. inputs. To understand how transformers express ICL when modeling
dynamics-driven functions, we investigate Markovian function learning through a
structured ICL setup, where we characterize the loss landscape to reveal
underlying optimization behaviors. Specifically, we (1) provide the closed-form
expression of the global minimizer (in an enlarged parameter space) for a
single-layer linear self-attention (LSA) model; (2) prove that recovering
transformer parameters that realize the optimal solution is NP-hard in general,
revealing a fundamental limitation of one-layer LSA in representing structured
dynamical functions; and (3) supply a novel interpretation of a multilayer LSA
as performing preconditioned gradient descent to optimize multiple objectives
beyond the square loss. These theoretical results are numerically validated
using simplified transformers.

Conclusion: 该方法为行业、政策制定者和农民在气候变化背景下构建更具韧性的农业提供了决策支持，成功结合了物理过程一致性和机器学习性能优势。

Abstract: Water is essential for agricultural productivity. Assessing water shortages
and reduced yield potential is a critical factor in decision-making for
ensuring agricultural productivity and food security. Crop simulation models,
which align with physical processes, offer intrinsic explainability but often
perform poorly. Conversely, machine learning models for crop yield modeling are
powerful and scalable, yet they commonly operate as black boxes and lack
adherence to the physical principles of crop growth. This study bridges this
gap by coupling the advantages of both worlds. We postulate that the crop yield
is inherently defined by the water availability. Therefore, we formulate crop
yield as a function of temporal water scarcity and predict both the crop
drought stress and the sensitivity to water scarcity at fine-scale resolution.
Sequentially modeling the crop yield response to water enables accurate yield
prediction. To enforce physical consistency, a novel physics-informed loss
function is proposed. We leverage multispectral satellite imagery,
meteorological data, and fine-scale yield data. Further, to account for the
uncertainty within the model, we build upon a deep ensemble approach. Our
method surpasses state-of-the-art models like LSTM and Transformers in crop
yield prediction with a coefficient of determination ($R^2$-score) of up to
0.82 while offering high explainability. This method offers decision support
for industry, policymakers, and farmers in building a more resilient
agriculture in times of changing climate conditions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对话动态模型通常无法推广到单个群组之外，且常采用可能不适合所有群组的通用公式来描述发言行为。

Method: 开发了先前对话模型的泛化版本，基于个体特征（人格特质）和过往发言行为来预测任何群组中个体的发言轮次，并能学习发言倾向如何随个体上次发言时间而变化。

Result: 在合成和真实对话数据上验证了该方法，结果表明先前的行为模型可能并不总是现实的。

Conclusion: 该数据驱动但理论基础扎实的方法能够更好地描述真实的群组互动。

Abstract: We propose a flexible probabilistic model for predicting turn-taking patterns
in group conversations based solely on individual characteristics and past
speaking behavior. Many models of conversation dynamics cannot yield insights
that generalize beyond a single group. Moreover, past works often aim to
characterize speaking behavior through a universal formulation that may not be
suitable for all groups. We thus develop a generalization of prior conversation
models that predicts speaking turns among individuals in any group based on
their individual characteristics, that is, personality traits, and prior
speaking behavior. Importantly, our approach provides the novel ability to
learn how speaking inclination varies based on when individuals last spoke. We
apply our model to synthetic and real-world conversation data to verify the
proposed approach and characterize real group interactions. Our results
demonstrate that previous behavioral models may not always be realistic,
motivating our data-driven yet theoretically grounded approach.

Method: 在Llama和Qwen等语言模型家族上，系统比较SFT和RL在指令跟随、通用知识和算术推理任务中的遗忘模式；建立简化的混合分布模型分析RL的模式寻求特性。

Result: RL在所有实验设置中都表现出比SFT更少的遗忘，同时目标任务性能相当或更高；RL的鲁棒性主要源于其使用在线策略数据，而非KL正则化或优势估计等其他算法选择。

Conclusion: RL因其模式寻求特性和在线策略数据使用而更抗遗忘；近似在线策略数据可作为缓解遗忘的高效替代方案。

Abstract: Adapting language models (LMs) to new tasks via post-training carries the
risk of degrading existing capabilities -- a phenomenon classically known as
catastrophic forgetting. In this paper, toward identifying guidelines for
mitigating this phenomenon, we systematically compare the forgetting patterns
of two widely adopted post-training methods: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and
reinforcement learning (RL). Our experiments reveal a consistent trend across
LM families (Llama, Qwen) and tasks (instruction following, general knowledge,
and arithmetic reasoning): RL leads to less forgetting than SFT while achieving
comparable or higher target task performance. To investigate the cause for this
difference, we consider a simplified setting in which the LM is modeled as a
mixture of two distributions, one corresponding to prior knowledge and the
other to the target task. We identify that the mode-seeking nature of RL, which
stems from its use of on-policy data, enables keeping prior knowledge intact
when learning the target task. We then verify this insight by demonstrating
that the use on-policy data underlies the robustness of RL to forgetting in
practical settings, as opposed to other algorithmic choices such as the KL
regularization or advantage estimation. Lastly, as a practical implication, our
results highlight the potential of mitigating forgetting using approximately
on-policy data, which can be substantially more efficient to obtain than fully
on-policy data.

Abstract: The vast majority of cardiovascular diseases may be preventable if early
signs and risk factors are detected. Cardiovascular monitoring with body-worn
sensor devices like sensor patches allows for the detection of such signs while
preserving the freedom and comfort of patients. However, the analysis of the
sensor data must be robust, reliable, efficient, and highly accurate. Deep
learning methods can automate data interpretation, reducing the workload of
clinicians. In this work, we analyze the feasibility of applying deep learning
models to the classification of synchronized electrocardiogram (ECG) and
phonocardiogram (PCG) recordings on resource-constrained medical edge devices.
We propose a convolutional neural network with early fusion of data to solve a
binary classification problem. We train and validate our model on the
synchronized ECG and PCG recordings from the Physionet Challenge 2016 dataset.
Our approach reduces memory footprint and compute cost by three orders of
magnitude compared to the state-of-the-art while maintaining competitive
accuracy. We demonstrate the applicability of our proposed model on medical
edge devices by analyzing energy consumption on a microcontroller and an
experimental sensor device setup, confirming that on-device inference can be
more energy-efficient than continuous data streaming.

Motivation: 虽然推理大语言模型在复杂推理任务中表现出色，但其服务性能和行为特征尚未被充分探索，这阻碍了RLLM在实际场景中的部署和应用。

Method: 首先通过试点研究比较RLLM与传统LLM的服务性能，然后系统评估现有推理优化技术（如模型量化、推测解码、前缀缓存等）对RLLM的有效性，最后在模拟真实工作负载下进行验证。

Result: 研究发现：(1)RLLM存在显著的内存使用和波动；(2)存在拖尾请求；(3)自适应运行时间；(4)领域偏好。模型量化和推测解码能提升服务效率且对精度影响小，而前缀缓存和KV缓存量化可能降低小RLLM的精度或性能。

Conclusion: 该研究为RLLM推理服务提供了重要见解，有助于研究社区和产业界推进RLLM的推理服务优化。

Abstract: The reasoning large language model (RLLM) has been proven competitive in
solving complex reasoning tasks such as mathematics, coding, compared to
general LLM. However, the serving performance and behavior of RLLM remains
unexplored, which may undermine the deployment and utilization of RLLM in
real-world scenario. To close this gap, in this paper, we conduct a
comprehensive study of RLLM service. We first perform a pilot study on
comparing the serving performance between RLLM and traditional LLM and reveal
that there are several distinct differences regarding serving behavior: (1)
significant memory usage and fluctuations; (2) straggler requests; (3) adaptive
running time; (4) domain preference. Then we further investigate whether
existing inference optimization techniques are valid for RLLM. Our main
takeaways are that model quantization methods and speculative decoding can
improve service system efficiency with small compromise to RLLM accuracy, while
prefix caching, KV cache quantization may even degrade accuracy or serving
performance for small RLLM. Lastly, we conduct evaluation under real world
workload modeled by Gamma distribution to verify our findings. Empirical
results of real world workload evaluation across different dataset are aligned
with our main findings regarding RLLM serving. We hope our work can provide the
research community and industry with insights to advance RLLM inference
serving.

Abstract: Casting complex inputs into tractable representations is a critical step
across various fields. Diverse embedding models emerge from differences in
architectures, loss functions, input modalities and datasets, each capturing
unique aspects of the input. Multi-teacher distillation leverages this
diversity to enrich representations but often remains tailored to specific
tasks. In this paper, we introduce a task-agnostic framework based on a
``majority vote" objective function. We demonstrate that this function is
bounded by the mutual information between student and teachers' embeddings,
leading to a task-agnostic distillation loss that eliminates dependence on
task-specific labels or prior knowledge. Our evaluations across text, vision
models, and molecular modeling show that our method effectively leverages
teacher diversity, resulting in representations enabling better performance for
a wide range of downstream tasks such as classification, clustering, or
regression. Additionally, we train and release state-of-the-art embedding
models, enhancing downstream performance in various modalities.

Conclusion: 该研究为处理多步预测的RL提供了理论工具和实用算法，解决了状态空间爆炸和维度诅咒问题，在预测不完美时仍能保持性能。

Abstract: Traditional reinforcement learning (RL) assumes the agents make decisions
based on Markov decision processes (MDPs) with one-step transition models. In
many real-world applications, such as energy management and stock investment,
agents can access multi-step predictions of future states, which provide
additional advantages for decision making. However, multi-step predictions are
inherently high-dimensional: naively embedding these predictions into an MDP
leads to an exponential blow-up in state space and the curse of dimensionality.
Moreover, existing RL theory provides few tools to analyze prediction-augmented
MDPs, as it typically works on one-step transition kernels and cannot
accommodate multi-step predictions with errors or partial action-coverage. We
address these challenges with three key innovations: First, we propose the
\emph{Bayesian value function} to characterize the optimal prediction-aware
policy tractably. Second, we develop a novel \emph{Bellman-Jensen Gap} analysis
on the Bayesian value function, which enables characterizing the value of
imperfect predictions. Third, we introduce BOLA (Bayesian Offline Learning with
Online Adaptation), a two-stage model-based RL algorithm that separates offline
Bayesian value learning from lightweight online adaptation to real-time
predictions. We prove that BOLA remains sample-efficient even under imperfect
predictions. We validate our theory and algorithm on synthetic MDPs and a
real-world wind energy storage control problem.

Abstract: Accurate weather forecasting across time scales is critical for anticipating
and mitigating the impacts of climate change. Recent data-driven methods based
on deep learning have achieved significant success in the medium range, but
struggle at longer subseasonal-to-seasonal (S2S) horizons due to error
accumulation in their autoregressive approach. In this work, we propose
OmniCast, a scalable and skillful probabilistic model that unifies weather
forecasting across timescales. OmniCast consists of two components: a VAE model
that encodes raw weather data into a continuous, lower-dimensional latent
space, and a diffusion-based transformer model that generates a sequence of
future latent tokens given the initial conditioning tokens. During training, we
mask random future tokens and train the transformer to estimate their
distribution given conditioning and visible tokens using a per-token diffusion
head. During inference, the transformer generates the full sequence of future
tokens by iteratively unmasking random subsets of tokens. This joint sampling
across space and time mitigates compounding errors from autoregressive
approaches. The low-dimensional latent space enables modeling long sequences of
future latent states, allowing the transformer to learn weather dynamics beyond
initial conditions. OmniCast performs competitively with leading probabilistic
methods at the medium-range timescale while being 10x to 20x faster, and
achieves state-of-the-art performance at the subseasonal-to-seasonal scale
across accuracy, physics-based, and probabilistic metrics. Furthermore, we
demonstrate that OmniCast can generate stable rollouts up to 100 years ahead.

ranking feedback, but their performance guarantees fail to improve-and can even
deteriorate-as the feedback length increases, despite the richer information
available. To address this gap, we adopt the Plackett-Luce (PL) model for
ranking feedback over action subsets and propose M-AUPO, an algorithm that
selects multiple actions by maximizing the average uncertainty within the
offered subset. We prove that M-AUPO achieves a suboptimality gap of
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}\left( \frac{d}{T} \sqrt{ \sum_{t=1}^T \frac{1}{|S_t|}}
\right)$, where $T$ is the total number of rounds, $d$ is the feature
dimension, and $|S_t|$ is the size of the subset at round $t$. This result
shows that larger subsets directly lead to improved performance and, notably,
the bound avoids the exponential dependence on the unknown parameter's norm,
which was a fundamental limitation in most previous works. Moreover, we
establish a near-matching lower bound of $\Omega \left( \frac{d}{K \sqrt{T}}
\right)$, where $K$ is the maximum subset size. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the first theoretical result in PbRL with ranking feedback that
explicitly shows improved sample efficiency as a function of the subset size.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了STEAM方法，用于生成医学治疗效应分析的合成数据，解决了现有方法未考虑下游因果推理任务特殊需求的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 真实医疗数据因监管障碍难以获取，合成数据成为有价值的替代方案，但现有生成方法未考虑治疗相关因果推理任务的独特挑战。

Method: 基于三个核心要求（协变量分布、治疗分配机制、结果生成机制的保持），提出了STEAM方法，该方法模拟包含治疗的数据生成过程并优化这些要求。

Result: 经验证明STEAM在提出的评估指标上达到最先进性能，特别是在真实数据生成过程复杂度增加时表现尤为突出。

Conclusion: STEAM为医学治疗效应分析提供了高质量的合成数据生成方法，特别适合复杂数据生成场景下的因果推理任务。

Abstract: Causal inference is essential for developing and evaluating medical
interventions, yet real-world medical datasets are often difficult to access
due to regulatory barriers. This makes synthetic data a potentially valuable
asset that enables these medical analyses, along with the development of new
inference methods themselves. Generative models can produce synthetic data that
closely approximate real data distributions, yet existing methods do not
consider the unique challenges that downstream causal inference tasks, and
specifically those focused on treatments, pose. We establish a set of
desiderata that synthetic data containing treatments should satisfy to maximise
downstream utility: preservation of (i) the covariate distribution, (ii) the
treatment assignment mechanism, and (iii) the outcome generation mechanism.
Based on these desiderata, we propose a set of evaluation metrics to assess
such synthetic data. Finally, we present STEAM: a novel method for generating
Synthetic data for Treatment Effect Analysis in Medicine that mimics the
data-generating process of data containing treatments and optimises for our
desiderata. We empirically demonstrate that STEAM achieves state-of-the-art
performance across our metrics as compared to existing generative models,
particularly as the complexity of the true data-generating process increases.

TL;DR: 提出L2O-CFGD方法，通过元学习动态调整Caputo分数梯度下降的超参数，解决分数梯度下降在收敛行为和超参数选择方面的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分数梯度下降虽然能加速优化，但在收敛行为和超参数选择方面面临重大挑战，特别是在非凸设置中，其超参数的影响尚未完全理解且调度困难。

Method: 提出L2O-CFGD方法，元学习如何动态调整Caputo分数梯度下降的超参数，生成元学习调度策略。

Result: 元学习调度策略优于通过广泛搜索找到的静态超参数CFGD，在某些任务中性能可与完全黑盒元学习优化器相媲美。

Conclusion: L2O-CFGD可作为强大工具，帮助研究人员识别高性能超参数，并深入了解如何在优化中利用分数微分的历史依赖性。

Abstract: Fractional Gradient Descent (FGD) offers a novel and promising way to
accelerate optimization by incorporating fractional calculus into machine
learning. Although FGD has shown encouraging initial results across various
optimization tasks, it faces significant challenges with convergence behavior
and hyperparameter selection. Moreover, the impact of its hyperparameters is
not fully understood, and scheduling them is particularly difficult in
non-convex settings such as neural network training. To address these issues,
we propose a novel approach called Learning to Optimize Caputo Fractional
Gradient Descent (L2O-CFGD), which meta-learns how to dynamically tune the
hyperparameters of Caputo FGD (CFGD). Our method's meta-learned schedule
outperforms CFGD with static hyperparameters found through an extensive search
and, in some tasks, achieves performance comparable to a fully black-box
meta-learned optimizer. L2O-CFGD can thus serve as a powerful tool for
researchers to identify high-performing hyperparameters and gain insights on
how to leverage the history-dependence of the fractional differential in
optimization.

TL;DR: CAGE是一种新的量化感知训练方法，通过曲率感知梯度估计来减少量化引起的精度损失，在Llama风格模型上W4A4量化中比现有方法多恢复10%以上的损失。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的低比特量化感知训练与原生训练之间仍存在较大的精度差距，需要新的方法来弥补这一差距。

Method: 提出CAGE方法，在直通估计器梯度基础上增加曲率感知修正项，基于多目标优化视角平衡损失最小化和量化约束，利用局部曲率信息进行梯度修正。

Result: 在800M参数的Llama风格模型预训练中，CAGE在W4A4量化下比异常值处理方法多恢复超过10%的量化引起的损失增加。

Conclusion: 曲率感知梯度修正能够弥补当前异常值处理方法之外剩余的性能差距，为量化训练提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Despite significant work on low-bit quantization-aware training (QAT), there
is still a large accuracy gap between such techniques and native training. To
address this, we introduce CAGE (Curvature-Aware Gradient Estimation), a new
QAT method that augments the straight-through estimator (STE) gradient with a
curvature-aware correction designed to counteract the loss increase induced by
quantization. CAGE is derived from a multi-objective view of QAT that balances
loss minimization with adherence to quantization constraints, yielding a
principled correction term that depends on local curvature information. On the
theoretical side, we introduce the notion of Pareto-optimal solutions for
quantized optimization, and establish that CAGE yields strong convergence
guarantees in the smooth non-convex setting. In terms of implementation, our
approach is optimizer-agnostic, but we provide a highly-efficient
implementation that leverages Adam statistics. When pre-training Llama-style
models of up to 800M-parameters, CAGE recovers over 10% of the
quantization-induced loss increase in the W4A4 regime over outlier-mitigation
methods. These results indicate that curvature-aware gradient corrections can
bridge the remaining performance gap beyond current outlier-handling methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线主题模型能够处理持续演化的数据流，与现实场景更契合，但相比离线方法关注较少，存在额外挑战需要解决。

Method: 扩展嵌入式主题模型(ETM)，使用截断stick-breaking构造处理文档-主题分布，自动推断活动主题数量；引入基于连续最优传输的主题嵌入合并策略，适应高维潜在主题空间。

Result: 数值实验显示SB-SETM在模拟场景中优于基线方法，在2022-2023年俄乌战争新闻语料上进行了广泛测试。

Conclusion: SB-SETM成功扩展了ETM到在线设置，通过创新的主题合并策略有效处理数据流，在真实世界新闻语料上验证了其性能。

Abstract: Online topic models are unsupervised algorithms to identify latent topics in
data streams that continuously evolve over time. Although these methods
naturally align with real-world scenarios, they have received considerably less
attention from the community compared to their offline counterparts, due to
specific additional challenges. To tackle these issues, we present SB-SETM, an
innovative model extending the Embedded Topic Model (ETM) to process data
streams by merging models formed on successive partial document batches. To
this end, SB-SETM (i) leverages a truncated stick-breaking construction for the
topic-per-document distribution, enabling the model to automatically infer from
the data the appropriate number of active topics at each timestep; and (ii)
introduces a merging strategy for topic embeddings based on a continuous
formulation of optimal transport adapted to the high dimensionality of the
latent topic space. Numerical experiments show SB-SETM outperforming baselines
on simulated scenarios. We extensively test it on a real-world corpus of news
articles covering the Russian-Ukrainian war throughout 2022-2023.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一个连续时间神经网络模型，统一了多种生物合理的学习算法，消除了阶段分离需求，揭示了学习依赖于输入与误差信号的时间重叠，并预测秒级可塑性时间窗口对生物学习至关重要。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生物学习是连续时间过程，但现有算法模型依赖离散更新和分离的推理学习阶段，需要开发更符合生物实际的连续时间学习模型。

Method: 构建连续时间神经网络模型，通过动态分析推导出SGD、FA、DFA、KP等学习规则作为特例，并进行仿真验证。

Result: 连续时间网络在生物时间尺度上稳定学习，学习强度随输入与误差信号时间延迟线性下降，稳健学习需要可塑性时间尺度超过刺激持续时间1-2个数量级。

Conclusion: 秒级资格迹是生物电路中误差驱动学习的必要条件，这为理解生物学习机制提供了可验证的预测。

Abstract: Biological learning unfolds continuously in time, yet most algorithmic models
rely on discrete updates and separate inference and learning phases. We study a
continuous-time neural model that unifies several biologically plausible
learning algorithms and removes the need for phase separation. Rules including
stochastic gradient descent (SGD), feedback alignment (FA), direct feedback
alignment (DFA), and Kolen-Pollack (KP) emerge naturally as limiting cases of
the dynamics. Simulations show that these continuous-time networks stably learn
at biological timescales, even under temporal mismatches and integration noise.
Through analysis and simulation, we show that learning depends on temporal
overlap: a synapse updates correctly only when its input and the corresponding
error signal coincide in time. When inputs are held constant, learning strength
declines linearly as the delay between input and error approaches the stimulus
duration, explaining observed robustness and failure across network depths.
Critically, robust learning requires the synaptic plasticity timescale to
exceed the stimulus duration by one to two orders of magnitude. For typical
cortical stimuli (tens of milliseconds), this places the functional plasticity
window in the few-second range, a testable prediction that identifies
seconds-scale eligibility traces as necessary for error-driven learning in
biological circuits.

TL;DR: 本文分析了Transformer中LRP方法的问题，发现双线性传播规则违反实现不变性公理，且绕过softmax层的CP-LRP方法能更好地与LOO对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LRP在Transformer中的公理合理性，特别是其与LOO特征重要性度量的一致性。

Method: 分析双线性传播规则的理论缺陷，并通过实验验证CP-LRP方法（绕过softmax层传播相关性）的效果。

Result: 双线性传播规则违反实现不变性公理，CP-LRP在Transformer中后层与LOO对齐度显著改善。

Conclusion: 双线性因子化敏感性和softmax传播误差共同削弱了LRP在Transformer中近似LOO的能力。

Abstract: Leave-One-Out (LOO) provides an intuitive measure of feature importance but
is computationally prohibitive. While Layer-Wise Relevance Propagation (LRP)
offers a potentially efficient alternative, its axiomatic soundness in modern
Transformers remains largely under-examined. In this work, we first show that
the bilinear propagation rules used in recent advances of AttnLRP violate the
implementation invariance axiom. We prove this analytically and confirm it
empirically in linear attention layers. Second, we also revisit CP-LRP as a
diagnostic baseline and find that bypassing relevance propagation through the
softmax layer -- backpropagating relevance only through the value matrices --
significantly improves alignment with LOO, particularly in middle-to-late
Transformer layers. Overall, our results suggest that (i) bilinear
factorization sensitivity and (ii) softmax propagation error potentially
jointly undermine LRP's ability to approximate LOO in Transformers.

Conclusion: 零阶优化范式将大脑固有噪声视为计算资源，不仅照亮了自然智能的理解，还对神经形态硬件有重大意义，有助于设计利用硬件噪声的快速节能AI系统。

Abstract: Iterative optimization is central to modern artificial intelligence (AI) and
provides a crucial framework for understanding adaptive systems. This review
provides a unified perspective on this subject, bridging classic theory with
neural network training and biological learning. Although gradient-based
methods, powered by the efficient but biologically implausible backpropagation
(BP), dominate machine learning, their computational demands can hinder
scalability in high-dimensional settings. In contrast, derivative-free or
zeroth-order (ZO) optimization feature computationally lighter approaches that
rely only on function evaluations and randomness. While generally less sample
efficient, recent breakthroughs demonstrate that modern ZO methods can
effectively approximate gradients and achieve performance competitive with BP
in neural network models. This ZO paradigm is also particularly relevant for
biology. Its core principles of random exploration (probing) and
feedback-guided adaptation (reinforcing) parallel key mechanisms of biological
learning, offering a mathematically principled perspective on how the brain
learns. In this review, we begin by categorizing optimization approaches based
on the order of derivative information they utilize, ranging from first-,
second-, and higher-order gradient-based to ZO methods. We then explore how
these methods are adapted to the unique challenges of neural network training
and the resulting learning dynamics. Finally, we build upon these insights to
view biological learning through an optimization lens, arguing that a ZO
paradigm leverages the brain's intrinsic noise as a computational resource.
This framework not only illuminates our understanding of natural intelligence
but also holds vast implications for neuromorphic hardware, helping us design
fast and energy-efficient AI systems that exploit intrinsic hardware noise.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的强化学习方法需要复杂的奖励机制，而OSFT旨在提供一种更简单高效的替代方案，利用模型自身的预训练知识来提升推理能力。

Method: 采用在线监督微调范式，模型生成回答后立即用这些自生成数据进行微调，默认只需一次迭代，无需外部奖励信号。

Result: 在数学推理任务上，OSFT达到了与GRPO等强RL方法相当的性能，同时更高效且鲁棒。

Conclusion: OSFT通过激活模型的潜在偏好知识来提升推理能力，为复杂奖励训练范式提供了高效有前景的替代方案。

Abstract: We present a simple, self-help online supervised finetuning (OSFT) paradigm
for LLM reasoning. In this paradigm, the model generates its own responses and
is immediately finetuned on this self-generated data. OSFT is a highly
efficient training strategy for LLM reasoning, as it is reward-free and uses
just one rollout by default. Experiment results show that OSFT achieves
downstream performance on challenging mathematical reasoning tasks comparable
to strong reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) methods such as
GRPO. Our ablation study further demonstrates the efficiency and robustness of
OSFT. The major mechanism of OSFT lies in facilitating the model's own existing
preference (latent knowledge) learned from pretraining, which leads to
reasoning ability improvement. We believe that OSFT offers an efficient and
promising alternative to more complex, reward-based training paradigms. Our
code is available at https://github.com/ElementQi/OnlineSFT.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种搜索自博弈（SSP）方法，通过让LLM同时扮演任务提出者和问题解决者，实现无需人工监督的强化学习训练，显著提升了搜索代理的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RLVR方法依赖精心设计的任务查询和真实答案，需要大量人工标注，限制了强化学习的扩展性，特别是在智能体场景下。现有任务合成方法难以控制生成任务的难度，无法提供有效的RL训练优势。

Method: 采用自博弈训练框架，LLM同时作为任务提出者和问题解决者。任务提出者生成具有明确真实答案且难度递增的深度搜索查询，问题解决者处理这些查询并输出答案预测。通过检索增强生成确保每个查询都有准确真实答案。

Result: 实验结果表明，SSP在各种基准测试中都能显著提升搜索代理的性能，无需任何监督，适用于从零开始和持续RL训练设置。

Conclusion: SSP方法通过自博弈实现了智能体能力的协同进化，为强化学习提供了更高的可扩展性，是解决RLVR扩展性问题的有效方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has become the
mainstream technique for training LLM agents. However, RLVR highly depends on
well-crafted task queries and corresponding ground-truth answers to provide
accurate rewards, which requires massive human efforts and hinders the RL
scaling processes, especially under agentic scenarios. Although a few recent
works explore task synthesis methods, the difficulty of generated agentic tasks
can hardly be controlled to provide effective RL training advantages. To
achieve agentic RLVR with higher scalability, we explore self-play training for
deep search agents, in which the learning LLM utilizes multi-turn search engine
calling and acts simultaneously as both a task proposer and a problem solver.
The task proposer aims to generate deep search queries with well-defined
ground-truth answers and increasing task difficulty. The problem solver tries
to handle the generated search queries and output the correct answer
predictions. To ensure that each generated search query has accurate ground
truth, we collect all the searching results from the proposer's trajectory as
external knowledge, then conduct retrieval-augmentation generation (RAG) to
test whether the proposed query can be correctly answered with all necessary
search documents provided. In this search self-play (SSP) game, the proposer
and the solver co-evolve their agent capabilities through both competition and
cooperation. With substantial experimental results, we find that SSP can
significantly improve search agents' performance uniformly on various
benchmarks without any supervision under both from-scratch and continuous RL
training setups. The code is at https://github.com/Alibaba-Quark/SSP.

Abstract: We introduce \textbf{BO4Mob}, a new benchmark framework for high-dimensional
Bayesian Optimization (BO), driven by the challenge of origin-destination (OD)
travel demand estimation in large urban road networks. Estimating OD travel
demand from limited traffic sensor data is a difficult inverse optimization
problem, particularly in real-world, large-scale transportation networks. This
problem involves optimizing over high-dimensional continuous spaces where each
objective evaluation is computationally expensive, stochastic, and
non-differentiable. BO4Mob comprises five scenarios based on real-world San
Jose, CA road networks, with input dimensions scaling up to 10,100. These
scenarios utilize high-resolution, open-source traffic simulations that
incorporate realistic nonlinear and stochastic dynamics. We demonstrate the
benchmark's utility by evaluating five optimization methods: three
state-of-the-art BO algorithms and two non-BO baselines. This benchmark is
designed to support both the development of scalable optimization algorithms
and their application for the design of data-driven urban mobility models,

Result: 在标准仿真任务中表现与最先进基线相当，在约束动作空间中优于传统actor-critic方法。

Conclusion: 证明了纯价值方法在连续控制中的可行性，为连续动作空间的强化学习提供了新思路。

Abstract: Value-based algorithms are a cornerstone of off-policy reinforcement learning
due to their simplicity and training stability. However, their use has
traditionally been restricted to discrete action spaces, as they rely on
estimating Q-values for individual state-action pairs. In continuous action
spaces, evaluating the Q-value over the entire action space becomes
computationally infeasible. To address this, actor-critic methods are typically
employed, where a critic is trained on off-policy data to estimate Q-values,
and an actor is trained to maximize the critic's output. Despite their
popularity, these methods often suffer from instability during training. In
this work, we propose a purely value-based framework for continuous control
that revisits structural maximization of Q-functions, introducing a set of key
architectural and algorithmic choices to enable efficient and stable learning.
We evaluate the proposed actor-free Q-learning approach on a range of standard
simulation tasks, demonstrating performance and sample efficiency on par with
state-of-the-art baselines, without the cost of learning a separate actor.
Particularly, in environments with constrained action spaces, where the value
functions are typically non-smooth, our method with structural maximization
outperforms traditional actor-critic methods with gradient-based maximization.

Abstract: Counterfactual inference provides a mathematical framework for reasoning
about hypothetical outcomes under alternative interventions, bridging causal
reasoning and predictive modeling. We present a counterfactual inference
framework for individualized risk estimation and intervention analysis,
illustrated through a clinical application to post-acute sequelae of COVID-19
(PASC) among patients with pre-existing heart failure (HF). Using longitudinal
diagnosis, laboratory, and medication data from a large health-system cohort,
we integrate regularized predictive modeling with counterfactual search to
identify actionable pathways to PASC-related HF hospital admissions. The
framework combines exact enumeration with optimization-based methods, including
the Nearest Instance Counterfactual Explanations (NICE) and Multi-Objective
Counterfactuals (MOC) algorithms, to efficiently explore high-dimensional
intervention spaces. Applied to more than 2700 individuals with confirmed
SARS-CoV-2 infection and prior HF, the model achieved strong discriminative
performance (AUROC: 0.88, 95% CI: 0.84-0.91) and generated interpretable,
patient-specific counterfactuals that quantify how modifying comorbidity
patterns or treatment factors could alter predicted outcomes. This work
demonstrates how counterfactual reasoning can be formalized as an optimization
problem over predictive functions, offering a rigorous, interpretable, and
computationally efficient approach to personalized inference in complex
biomedical systems.

TL;DR: 该研究分析了模拟神经计算电路中噪声和神经元激活函数不均匀性对神经网络性能的影响，发现在材料信息学应用中，神经网络对噪声容忍度较低，但可通过重新训练缓解激活函数不均匀性的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 模拟神经计算电路在高吞吐量、低功耗机器学习应用中具有潜力，但必须应对电路噪声和神经元激活函数不均匀性的挑战，特别是在材料信息学等需要高性能计算的应用中。

Method: 通过计算研究分析电路噪声和激活函数不均匀性对不同神经网络架构和训练机制的影响，使用材料信息学作为代表性应用案例，包括碳氢化合物形成能量、双钙钛矿能带间隙等数据集。

Result: 神经网络普遍具有较低的噪声容忍度，模型准确率随噪声水平快速下降。单隐藏层网络和过大的网络具有相对更好的噪声容忍度，过拟合较少的模型更耐噪声。激活函数不均匀性可通过使用实际实现的激活函数形状重新训练来缓解。

Conclusion: 模拟神经计算电路中的噪声和激活函数不均匀性严重影响神经网络性能，但通过选择合适的网络架构和重新训练策略可以部分缓解这些问题，为模拟神经计算的实际应用提供了指导。

Abstract: Dedicated analog neurocomputing circuits are promising for high-throughput,
low power consumption applications of machine learning (ML) and for
applications where implementing a digital computer is unwieldy (remote
locations; small, mobile, and autonomous devices, extreme conditions, etc.).
Neural networks (NN) implemented in such circuits, however, must contend with
circuit noise and the non-uniform shapes of the neuron activation function
(NAF) due to the dispersion of performance characteristics of circuit elements
(such as transistors or diodes implementing the neurons). We present a
computational study of the impact of circuit noise and NAF inhomogeneity in
function of NN architecture and training regimes. We focus on one application
that requires high-throughput ML: materials informatics, using as
representative problem ML of formation energies vs. lowest-energy isomer of
peri-condensed hydrocarbons, formation energies and band gaps of double
perovskites, and zero point vibrational energies of molecules from QM9 dataset.
We show that NNs generally possess low noise tolerance with the model accuracy
rapidly degrading with noise level. Single-hidden layer NNs, and NNs with
larger-than-optimal sizes are somewhat more noise-tolerant. Models that show
less overfitting (not necessarily the lowest test set error) are more
noise-tolerant. Importantly, we demonstrate that the effect of activation
function inhomogeneity can be palliated by retraining the NN using practically

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于脉冲神经网络的轻量级EEG人员识别方法，在保持100%准确率的同时，能耗仅为传统深度神经网络的10%以下。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有EEG人员识别技术依赖深度学习架构，计算成本高，限制了应用范围。需要开发更高效的方法。

Method: 使用脉冲神经网络（SNN）和轻量级脉冲变换器处理EEG信号的时序复杂性。

Result: 在EEG音乐情感识别挑战数据集上实现100%分类准确率，能耗比传统深度神经网络降低90%以上。

Conclusion: 该方法为开发高效节能的高性能脑机接口提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: EEG-based person identification enables applications in security,
personalized brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), and cognitive monitoring.
However, existing techniques often rely on deep learning architectures at high
computational cost, limiting their scope of applications. In this study, we
propose a novel EEG person identification approach using spiking neural
networks (SNNs) with a lightweight spiking transformer for efficiency and
effectiveness. The proposed SNN model is capable of handling the temporal
complexities inherent in EEG signals. On the EEG-Music Emotion Recognition
Challenge dataset, the proposed model achieves 100% classification accuracy
with less than 10% energy consumption of traditional deep neural networks. This
study offers a promising direction for energy-efficient and high-performance
BCIs. The source code is available at

### [313] [Self-Evidencing Through Hierarchical Gradient Decomposition: A Dissipative System That Maintains Non-Equilibrium Steady-State by Minimizing Variational Free Energy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17916)
*Michael James McCulloch*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个实现自由能原理的构造性证明，通过精确的局部信用分配机制，包括空间信用、时间信用和结构信用，实现了层次化梯度计算。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自由能原理指出自组织系统必须最小化变分自由能量才能持续存在，但从原理到可实施算法的路径一直不明确。

Method: 系统通过层次化分解梯度计算：空间信用通过反馈对齐，时间信用通过资格迹，结构信用通过营养场图(TFM)估计每个连接块的期望梯度幅度。

Result: TFM与oracle梯度的Pearson相关性达到0.9693，系统表现出98.6%的任务干扰后保留率，能从75%结构损伤中自主恢复，实现自组织临界性，并在无回放缓冲的情况下在连续控制任务中进行样本高效的强化学习。

Conclusion: 该架构统一了Prigogine的耗散结构、Friston的自由能最小化和Hopfield的吸引子动力学，证明精确的层次化网络拓扑推断可以通过局部、生物学合理的规则实现。

Abstract: The Free Energy Principle (FEP) states that self-organizing systems must
minimize variational free energy to persist, but the path from principle to
implementable algorithm has remained unclear. We present a constructive proof
that the FEP can be realized through exact local credit assignment. The system
decomposes gradient computation hierarchically: spatial credit via feedback
alignment, temporal credit via eligibility traces, and structural credit via a
Trophic Field Map (TFM) that estimates expected gradient magnitude for each
connection block. We prove these mechanisms are exact at their respective
levels and validate the central claim empirically: the TFM achieves 0.9693
Pearson correlation with oracle gradients. This exactness produces emergent
capabilities including 98.6% retention after task interference, autonomous
recovery from 75% structural damage, self-organized criticality (spectral
radius p ~= 1.0$), and sample-efficient reinforcement learning on continuous
control tasks without replay buffers. The architecture unifies Prigogine's
dissipative structures, Friston's free energy minimization, and Hopfield's
attractor dynamics, demonstrating that exact hierarchical inference over
network topology can be implemented with local, biologically plausible rules.

### [314] [Activation Manifold Projection: Liberating Task-Specific Behaviors from LLM Architectures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17902)
*Al Kari*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CAST框架通过在学习两个不同LLM架构的激活流形之间建立直接的非线性映射，将LoRA适配器从源模型架构中解放出来，实现跨架构的行为迁移。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM微调中存在的架构锁定问题，即特定任务行为被限制在源模型架构中，现有权重空间迁移方法脆弱且间接。

Method: 将预训练LoRA视为冻结的行为核，学习轻量级双向投影头，在通用文本语料上训练，将目标模型激活流映射到源模型潜在空间，应用冻结核后再投影回来。

Result: 在Llama-2和Mistral等异构模型家族间的迁移实验中，CAST转换的适配器达到在目标模型上完全重新训练LoRA性能的85-95%，优于当前权重空间迁移技术。

Conclusion: CAST实现了真正的零样本LoRA适配器迁移，建立了模型互操作性的新标准，有效将学习技能与源架构解耦。

Abstract: The proliferation of Large Language Model (LLM) architectures presents a
fundamental challenge: valuable, task-specific behaviors learned through
fine-tuning methods like Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) are effectively trapped
within their source model's architecture, herein referred to architectural
lock-in. Existing transfer methods attempt to bridge this gap by aligning the
static weight spaces of models, a brittle and indirect approach that relies on
tenuous correlations between parameter geometries. This paper introduces a
fundamentally different and more direct paradigm: the Cartridge Activation
Space Transfer (CAST), a novel framework that liberates LoRA-encoded behaviors
by learning a direct, nonlinear mapping between the activation manifolds, the
geometric structures formed by the model's internal neuron activations, of two
distinct LLM architectures. CAST treats a pre-trained LoRA as a frozen
"behavioral kernel." It learns a set of lightweight, bidirectional projection
heads that translate the target model's activation stream into the source
model's latent space, apply the frozen kernel, and project the result back.
This process, trained on a general text corpus without any task-specific data,
effectively decouples the learned skill from the source architecture. We
demonstrate that CAST enables true "zero-shot" translation of any standard LoRA
adapter. Our experiments, including transfers between heterogeneous model
families like Llama-2 and Mistral, show that CAST-translated adapters achieve
85-95\% of the performance of a LoRA fully retrained on the target model,
quantitatively outperforming current weight-space transfer techniques and
establishing a new state-of-the-art in model interoperability.

### [315] [Beyond More Context: Retrieval Diversity Boosts Multi-Turn Intent Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17940)
*Zhiming Lin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种多样性感知检索框架，通过平衡意图覆盖和语言多样性来选择上下文示例，在固定token预算下显著提升LLM的多轮意图理解性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决任务导向聊天机器人中多轮意图理解面临的两个关键问题：token预算限制和上下文噪声，同时避免传统检索方法只关注相关性而忽视集合级多样性和混淆因素的问题

Method: 开发了多样性感知检索框架，选择上下文示例时平衡意图覆盖和语言多样性，并与标准LLM解码器集成；评估时强制执行预算匹配提示和随机位置，并进行敏感性分析

Result: 在MultiWOZ 2.4和SGD数据集上，在相同token预算下实现了联合目标准确率的显著提升，超越了强大的LLM/DST基线，在K=4到7范围内表现一致，延迟适中

Conclusion: 研究分离并验证了检索中内容多样性的影响，为构建准确、预算受限的多轮意图系统提供了一个简单可部署的选择原则

Abstract: Multi turn intent understanding is central to task oriented chatbots, yet
real deployments face tight token budgets and noisy contexts, and most
retrieval pipelines emphasize relevance while overlooking set level diversity
and confounds such as more context or exemplar order. We ask whether retrieval
diversity, rather than longer prompts, systematically improves LLM intent
understanding under fixed budgets. We present a diversity aware retrieval
framework that selects in context exemplars to balance intent coverage and
linguistic variety, and integrates this selection with standard LLM decoders;
the evaluation enforces budget matched prompts and randomized positions, and
includes sensitivity analyses over exemplar count, diversity strength, and
backbone size. On MultiWOZ 2.4 and SGD, the approach achieves strong gains in
Joint Goal Accuracy under equal token budgets, surpassing strong LLM/DST
baselines, with consistent improvements across K from 4 to 7 and moderate
latency. Overall, the study isolates and validates the impact of content
diversity in retrieval and offers a simple, deployable selection principle for
building accurate, budget constrained multi turn intent systems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一个仅使用LLM合成智能体数据的统一框架，无需人工监督，可生成包含任务规范、工具定义、策略伪代码、自然语言交互和执行轨迹的完整交互记录。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 收集智能体数据需要人工标注，成本高、耗时长且难以扩展，因此需要一种可扩展的合成数据生成方法。

Method: 使用模块化流水线生成符合严格语法和语义约束的交互记录，包括约束生成格式、JSON模式验证和基于评判的过滤。

Result: 能够生成单任务、多任务和多轮智能体交互的完整数据集，涵盖工具使用的全部能力范围。

Conclusion: 该框架为手动收集提供了可重现的LLM-only替代方案，推动了能够稳健使用工具的智能体LLM的发展。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as agents, expected to
decompose goals, invoke tools, and verify results in dynamic environments.
Realizing these capabilities requires access to agentic data-structured
interaction records that couple user intents with tool specifications,
argument-grounded calls, and verifiable execution traces. However, collecting
such data from human annotators is costly, time-consuming, and difficult to
scale. We present a unified framework for synthesizing agentic data using only
LLMs, without any human-in-the-loop supervision. This framework decomposes
generation into modular pipelines that produce complete interaction records
spanning task specifications, tool definitions, policy pseudocode, natural
language exchanges, and execution traces. Records conform to strict syntactic
and semantic constraints, ensuring machine-parseability and faithful alignment
across inputs, outputs, and tool calls. Beyond single tasks, there is support
for both multi-task and multi-turn agent interactions, enabling the
construction of datasets that reflect the full spectrum of tool-use
competencies. To ensure quality and consistency, the framework integrates
constrained generation formats, JSON-schema validation, and judge-based
filtering. This paper formalizes the schema for agentic records, details the
prompt design principles that guide generation, and introduces scalable
pipelines for high-quality synthetic data. By providing a reproducible,
LLM-only alternative to manual collection, hence advancing the development of
agentic LLMs capable of robust tool use.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种多智能体口头强化学习算法，通过动态构建和优化协作结构来增强多智能体推理能力，在多种推理任务上显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多智能体系统要么采用预定义结构，要么依赖多数投票或圆桌辩论，这会压制正确但非主导的智能体贡献。假设有效的智能体通信对多智能体推理至关重要。

Method: 提出多智能体口头强化学习算法，定义动作空间和反馈机制，评估辩论过程中的通信鲁棒性和连贯性，最终通过多数投票做出决策。

Result: 在数学推理、创意写作、科学推理和数值排序等任务上，该方法显著优于单智能体提示方法和最先进的多智能体框架。

Conclusion: 有效的智能体通信和辩论质量在多智能体推理中起关键作用，动态优化的协作结构能显著提升推理性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable reasoning capabilities in
mathematical and scientific tasks. To enhance complex reasoning, multi-agent
systems have been proposed to harness the collective intelligence of LLM
agents. However, existing collaboration structures are either predefined or
rely on majority voting or round-table debates, which can suppress correct but
less dominant agent contributions. Recent approaches model multi-agent systems
as graph networks but optimize purely for agent performance, neglecting the
quality of interactions. We hypothesize that effective agent communication is
crucial for multi-agent reasoning and that debating quality plays a significant
role. To address this, we propose $\ours$, a multi-agent verbal reinforcement
learning algorithm that dynamically constructs and refines multi-agent
collaboration structures. Our method defines action spaces and a feedback
mechanism that evaluates communication robustness and coherence throughout the
debate. The final decision is achieved through a majority vote over all the
agents. We assess $\ours$ on various reasoning tasks, including mathematical
reasoning, creative writing, scientific reasoning, and numerical sorting.
Results demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms single-agent
prompting methods and state-of-the-art multi-agent frameworks on diverse tasks.

### [318] [Subject-Event Ontology Without Global Time: Foundations and Execution Semantics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18040)
*Alexander Boldachev*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于主体-事件的本体论形式化方法，用于建模复杂动态系统，不依赖全局时间。核心原则包括事件作为固定行为、因果顺序通过happens-before关系、可执行本体论、模型作为认知过滤器、以及真值预设。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为复杂动态系统提供不依赖全局时间的建模方法，解决分布式系统、微服务架构、DLT平台和多视角场景中的建模挑战。

Method: 基于九个公理(A1-A9)的形式化方法，包括事件固定、因果顺序定义、声明式数据流机制、模型验证和因果链自动构建。

Result: 开发了boldsea系统作为可执行本体论的工作流引擎，理论构造在BSL语言中实现，证明了方法的实际适用性。

Conclusion: 该形式化方法适用于分布式系统、微服务架构、DLT平台和多视角场景，为无全局时间依赖的系统建模提供了理论基础和实际工具。

Abstract: A formalization of a subject-event ontology is proposed for modeling complex
dynamic systems without reliance on global time. Key principles: (1) event as
an act of fixation - a subject discerns and fixes changes according to models
(conceptual templates) available to them; (2) causal order via happens-before -
the order of events is defined by explicit dependencies, not timestamps; (3)
making the ontology executable via a declarative dataflow mechanism, ensuring
determinism; (4) models as epistemic filters - a subject can only fix what
falls under its known concepts and properties; (5) presumption of truth - the
declarative content of an event is available for computation from the moment of
fixation, without external verification. The formalization includes nine axioms
(A1-A9), ensuring the correctness of executable ontologies: monotonicity of
history (I1), acyclicity of causality (I2), traceability (I3). Special
attention is given to the model-based approach (A9): event validation via
schemas, actor authorization, automatic construction of causal chains (W3)
without global time. Practical applicability is demonstrated on the boldsea
system - a workflow engine for executable ontologies, where the theoretical
constructs are implemented in BSL (Boldsea Semantic Language). The
formalization is applicable to distributed systems, microservice architectures,
DLT platforms, and multiperspectivity scenarios (conflicting facts from
different subjects).

*Joong Ho Choi,Jiayang Zhao,Jeel Shah,Ritvika Sonawane,Vedant Singh,Avani Appalla,Will Flanagan,Filipe Condessa*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CompactPrompt是一个端到端提示压缩管道，通过合并硬提示压缩和轻量级文件级数据压缩，在保持输出质量的同时将LLM代理的令牌使用量和推理成本降低高达60%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在代理工作流中运行成本高昂，需要处理冗长的提示和丰富的数据流，因此需要降低运行成本。

Method: 使用自信息评分和基于依赖关系的短语分组从提示中修剪低信息令牌，同时对附加文档中的重复文本模式应用n-gram缩写，对数值列应用统一量化。

Result: 在TAT-QA和FinQA等基准数据集上，总令牌使用量和推理成本降低高达60%，同时输出质量保持稳定（Claude-3.5-Sonnet和GPT-4.1-Mini的准确率下降小于5%）。

Conclusion: CompactPrompt为更精简的生成式AI管道奠定了基础，能够可视化实时压缩决策并量化成本性能权衡。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) deliver powerful reasoning and generation
capabilities but incur substantial run-time costs when operating in agentic
workflows that chain together lengthy prompts and process rich data streams. We
introduce CompactPrompt, an end-to-end pipeline that merges hard prompt
compression with lightweight file-level data compression. CompactPrompt first
prunes low-information tokens from prompts using self-information scoring and
dependency-based phrase grouping. In parallel, it applies n-gram abbreviation
to recurrent textual patterns in attached documents and uniform quantization to
numerical columns, yielding compact yet semantically faithful representations.
Integrated into standard LLM agents, CompactPrompt reduces total token usage
and inference cost by up to 60% on benchmark dataset like TAT-QA and FinQA,
while preserving output quality (Results in less than 5% accuracy drop for
Claude-3.5-Sonnet, and GPT-4.1-Mini) CompactPrompt helps visualize real-time
compression decisions and quantify cost-performance trade-offs, laying the
groundwork for leaner generative AI pipelines.

*Daniel Israel,Tian Jin,Ellie Cheng,Guy Van den Broeck,Aditya Grover,Suvinay Subramanian,Michael Carbin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合自回归和扩散模型的混合方法——计划扩散，通过两阶段生成（先自回归规划，后并行扩散生成）来平衡生成速度与质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型推理中生成速度与输出质量之间的权衡问题，自回归模型质量高但速度慢，扩散模型可并行但需要多次迭代。

Method: 两阶段方法：1）自回归生成短规划，将输出分解为独立片段；2）使用扩散模型并行生成这些片段。

Result: 在AlpacaEval测试中，相比纯自回归生成实现了1.27x-1.81x加速，仅损失0.87%-5.4%的胜率，达到帕累托最优权衡。

Conclusion: 计划扩散扩展了速度-质量的帕累托前沿，为高质量文本生成提供了实用加速路径，规划机制稳定且可通过简单参数灵活控制权衡。

Abstract: A central challenge in large language model inference is the trade-off
between generation speed and output quality. Autoregressive models produce
high-quality text but generate tokens sequentially. Diffusion models can
generate tokens in parallel but often need many iterations to match the same
quality. We propose planned diffusion, a hybrid method that combines the
strengths of both paradigms. Planned diffusion works in two stages: first, the
model creates a short autoregressive plan that breaks the output into smaller,
independent spans. Second, the model generates these spans simultaneously using
diffusion. This approach expands the speed-quality Pareto frontier and provides
a practical path to faster, high-quality text generation. On AlpacaEval, a
suite of 805 instruction-following prompts, planned diffusion achieves
Pareto-optimal trade-off between quality and latency, achieving 1.27x to 1.81x
speedup over autoregressive generation with only 0.87\% to 5.4\% drop in win
rate, respectively. Our sensitivity analysis shows that the planning mechanism
of planned diffusion is minimal and reliable, and simple runtime knobs exist to
provide flexible control of the quality-latency trade-off.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SMaRT框架通过融合多种推理策略来提升LLM性能，克服单一策略的局限性，在推理、规划和决策任务中优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖单一策略提示，缺乏不同推理方法的协同效应，需要融合多种策略来最大化性能和确保鲁棒性。

Method: 提出Select, Mix, and ReinvenT (SMaRT)框架，将LLM作为智能集成器而非仅评估器，无缝整合多样化推理策略。

Result: 在推理、规划和顺序决策基准测试中，SMaRT在解决方案质量、约束遵守和性能指标方面持续优于最先进基线。

Conclusion: 这项工作通过开创跨策略校准新范式，重新定义了LLM驱动的决策制定，为推理系统解锁了优越结果并推进了自我精化方法学的边界。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have redefined complex task automation with
exceptional generalization capabilities. Despite these advancements,
state-of-the-art methods rely on single-strategy prompting, missing the synergy
of diverse reasoning approaches. No single strategy excels universally,
highlighting the need for frameworks that fuse strategies to maximize
performance and ensure robustness. We introduce the Select, Mix, and ReinvenT
(SMaRT) framework, an innovative strategy fusion approach designed to overcome
this constraint by creating balanced and efficient solutions through the
seamless integration of diverse reasoning strategies. Unlike existing methods,
which employ LLMs merely as evaluators, SMaRT uses them as intelligent
integrators, unlocking the "best of all worlds" across tasks. Extensive
empirical evaluations across benchmarks in reasoning, planning, and sequential
decision-making highlight the robustness and adaptability of SMaRT. The
framework consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in solution
quality, constraint adherence, and performance metrics. This work redefines
LLM-driven decision-making by pioneering a new paradigm in cross-strategy
calibration, unlocking superior outcomes for reasoning systems and advancing
the boundaries of self-refining methodologies.

TL;DR: 提出了SIEV框架，基于辩证法评估语言模型的推理过程，发现即使基准测试饱和的模型在推理过程中仍存在显著缺陷


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前评估仅关注模型答案的正确性，但无法揭示推理过程的质量，需要更深入评估模型如何达到结论

Method: 基于辩证法理论（正题、反题、合题），开发SIEV结构化框架，评估模型解决矛盾、整合观点和进行高阶推理的能力

Result: SIEV揭示了最先进模型在推理过程中的重大缺陷，GPT-5-chat在GSM基准上损失超过40分

Conclusion: 采用过程导向、哲学基础的方法能够对LLM推理进行更深入、严谨和区分性的评估

Abstract: What does it truly mean for a language model to "reason"? Most current
evaluations and benchmarks reward models' correct standalone answers--but
correctness alone reveals little about the process that produced them. In this
work, we explore a different perspective: reasoning is not a static chain of
steps, but a dynamic trajectory where ideas interact, clash, and evolve into
deeper insights. To capture this dynamic, we draw on a well-established
philosophical tradition: \textit{dialectics}, where reasoning unfolds through
thesis, antithesis, and synthesis. Building on this, we present SIEV, a
structured framework that evaluates reasoning of LLMs through dialectics.
Unlike conventional evaluations, SIEV assesses not only the conclusion a model
reaches, but how it gets there: its ability to resolve tension, integrate
distinct ideas, and synthesize higher-order reasoning. This lens uncovers
significant reasoning gaps in state-of-the-art models even under saturated
benchmarks like GSM and MMLU. For instance, GPT-5-chat, a recent model, loses
over 40 points (out of 100) when evaluated with SIEV on GSM. Our findings
highlight that adopting a process-oriented, philosophically grounded approach
enables a deeper, more rigorous, and more discriminative assessment of LLM
reasoning.

TL;DR: PaDA-Agent通过评估驱动的模式引导数据增强方法，显著提升小型语言模型在领域特定任务上的性能表现


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 小型语言模型在部署成本和延迟方面具有优势，但在复杂领域特定任务上的准确性往往落后于大型模型，而监督微调需要大量手动数据准备和迭代优化工作

Method: 提出PaDA-Agent方法，通过评估从验证数据中发现失败模式，制定有针对性的数据增强策略，直接减少泛化差距，而不是仅关注模型训练错误

Result: 实验结果显示，相比最先进的基于LLM的数据增强方法，在Llama 3.2 1B Instruct模型微调上取得了显著改进

Conclusion: PaDA-Agent提供了一种有效的数据增强方法，能够显著提升小型语言模型在领域特定任务上的性能，同时减少手动优化工作

Abstract: Small Language Models (SLMs) offer compelling advantages in deployment cost
and latency, but their accuracy often lags behind larger models, particularly
for complex domain-specific tasks. While supervised fine-tuning can help bridge
this performance gap, it requires substantial manual effort in data preparation
and iterative optimization. We present PaDA-Agent (Pattern-guided Data
Augmentation Agent), an evaluation-driven approach that streamlines the data
augmentation process for SLMs through coordinated operations. Unlike
state-of-the-art approaches that focus on model training errors only and
generating error-correcting samples, PaDA-Agent discovers failure patterns from
the validation data via evaluations and drafts targeted data augmentation
strategies aiming to directly reduce the generalization gap. Our experimental
results demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art LLM-based
data augmentation approaches for Llama 3.2 1B Instruct model fine-tuning.

Motivation: 当前基于文本推理步骤的安全监控方法可能遗漏细微的有害模式，且可能被隐藏不安全推理的模型规避。需要更精确的激活级监控技术。

Method: 构建包含推理序列的句子级标注数据集，标注安全行为如安全关切表达、用户意图推测等，并用于提取检测和影响这些行为的转向向量。

Conclusion: 激活级监控技术能够改进推理过程中的安全监督，填补了安全研究中的关键空白，为更精确的安全行为检测提供了基础。

Abstract: Recent work has highlighted the importance of monitoring chain-of-thought
reasoning for AI safety; however, current approaches that analyze textual
reasoning steps can miss subtle harmful patterns and may be circumvented by
models that hide unsafe reasoning. We present a sentence-level labeled dataset
that enables activation-based monitoring of safety behaviors during LLM
reasoning. Our dataset contains reasoning sequences with sentence-level
annotations of safety behaviors such as expression of safety concerns or
speculation on user intent, which we use to extract steering vectors for
detecting and influencing these behaviors within model activations. The dataset
fills a key gap in safety research: while existing datasets label reasoning
holistically, effective application of steering vectors for safety monitoring
could be improved by identifying precisely when specific behaviors occur within
reasoning chains. We demonstrate the dataset's utility by extracting
representations that both detect and steer safety behaviors in model
activations, showcasing the potential of activation-level techniques for

*Man-Lin Chu,Lucian Terhorst,Kadin Reed,Tom Ni,Weiwei Chen,Rongyu Lin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出基于大语言模型的多智能体模拟框架，用于模拟消费者决策和社会动态，为营销策略提供低成本预实施测试。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的事后分析和基于规则的智能体模型难以捕捉人类行为和社会互动的复杂性，需要更有效的营销策略测试工具。

Method: 利用大语言模型在沙盒环境中构建多智能体模拟框架，让生成式智能体能够互动、表达内部推理、形成习惯并进行购买决策，无需预定义规则。

Result: 在价格折扣营销场景中，系统提供了可操作的策略测试结果，并揭示了传统方法无法捕捉的新兴社会模式。

Conclusion: 该方法为营销人员提供了一个可扩展、低风险的预实施测试工具，减少了对耗时的事后评估的依赖，并降低了营销活动表现不佳的风险。

Abstract: Simulating consumer decision-making is vital for designing and evaluating
marketing strategies before costly real-world deployment. However, post-event
analyses and rule-based agent-based models (ABMs) struggle to capture the
complexity of human behavior and social interaction. We introduce an
LLM-powered multi-agent simulation framework that models consumer decisions and
social dynamics. Building on recent advances in large language model simulation
in a sandbox environment, our framework enables generative agents to interact,
express internal reasoning, form habits, and make purchasing decisions without
predefined rules. In a price-discount marketing scenario, the system delivers
actionable strategy-testing outcomes and reveals emergent social patterns
beyond the reach of conventional methods. This approach offers marketers a
scalable, low-risk tool for pre-implementation testing, reducing reliance on
time-intensive post-event evaluations and lowering the risk of underperforming
campaigns.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出Saber算法，一种无需训练的新型采样方法，用于扩散语言模型在代码生成任务中实现更好的推理速度和输出质量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散语言模型在代码生成任务中面临推理速度与输出质量的关键权衡，减少采样步骤通常导致性能灾难性下降

Method: Saber算法基于两个关键洞察：1) 随着代码上下文的建立可以自适应加速；2) 需要回溯机制来反转生成的token

Result: 在多个主流代码生成基准测试中，Saber比主流DLM采样方法平均提升1.9%的Pass@1准确率，同时实现平均251.4%的推理加速

Conclusion: 通过利用DLM的固有优势，我们的工作显著缩小了与自回归模型在代码生成中的性能差距

Abstract: Diffusion language models (DLMs) are emerging as a powerful and promising
alternative to the dominant autoregressive paradigm, offering inherent
advantages in parallel generation and bidirectional context modeling. However,
the performance of DLMs on code generation tasks, which have stronger
structural constraints, is significantly hampered by the critical trade-off
between inference speed and output quality. We observed that accelerating the
code generation process by reducing the number of sampling steps usually leads
to a catastrophic collapse in performance. In this paper, we introduce
efficient Sampling with Adaptive acceleration and Backtracking Enhanced
Remasking (i.e., Saber), a novel training-free sampling algorithm for DLMs to
achieve better inference speed and output quality in code generation.
Specifically, Saber is motivated by two key insights in the DLM generation
process: 1) it can be adaptively accelerated as more of the code context is
established; 2) it requires a backtracking mechanism to reverse the generated
tokens. Extensive experiments on multiple mainstream code generation benchmarks
show that Saber boosts Pass@1 accuracy by an average improvement of 1.9% over
mainstream DLM sampling methods, meanwhile achieving an average 251.4%
inference speedup. By leveraging the inherent advantages of DLMs, our work
significantly narrows the performance gap with autoregressive models in code
generation.

TL;DR: AgentChangeBench是一个专门评估工具增强语言模型代理在对话中适应目标变化的基准测试，涵盖三个企业领域，包含2,835个任务序列和五种用户角色，通过四个互补指标系统评估代理的适应能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界多轮交互中目标变化是常见特征，但当前代理基准主要评估静态目标或一次性工具使用，缺乏对动态目标适应能力的系统评估。

Method: 构建AgentChangeBench基准框架，包含2,835个任务序列和五种用户角色，设计现实的工作流转换点，通过四个指标（任务成功率、工具使用效率、工具调用冗余率、目标转换恢复时间）系统评估代理表现。

Result: 评估显示前沿模型在动态目标适应方面存在显著差异：GPT-4o在航班预订转换中达到92.2%恢复率，而Gemini降至48.6%；零售任务参数有效性接近完美但冗余率超过80%，揭示重大效率问题。

Conclusion: 高原始准确率并不意味着在动态目标下的鲁棒性，明确测量恢复时间和冗余率对于评估代理韧性至关重要，AgentChangeBench为诊断和改进企业环境中代理韧性提供了可复现的测试平台。

Abstract: Goal changes are a defining feature of real world multi-turn interactions,
yet current agent benchmarks primarily evaluate static objectives or one-shot
tool use. We introduce AgentChangeBench, a benchmark explicitly designed to
measure how tool augmented language model agents adapt to mid dialogue goal
shifts across three enterprise domains. Our framework formalizes evaluation
through four complementary metrics: Task Success Rate (TSR) for effectiveness,
Tool Use Efficiency (TUE) for reliability, Tool Call Redundancy Rate (TCRR) for
wasted effort, and Goal-Shift Recovery Time (GSRT) for adaptation latency.
AgentChangeBench comprises 2,835 task sequences and five user personas, each
designed to trigger realistic shift points in ongoing workflows. Using this
setup, we evaluate several frontier models and uncover sharp contrasts obscured
by traditional $\text{pass}@k$ scores: for example, GPT-4o reaches $92.2\%$
recovery on airline booking shifts while Gemini collapses to $48.6\%$, and
retail tasks show near perfect parameter validity yet redundancy rates above
$80\%$, revealing major inefficiencies. These findings demonstrate that high
raw accuracy does not imply robustness under dynamic goals, and that explicit
measurement of recovery time and redundancy is essential. AgentChangeBench
establishes a reproducible testbed for diagnosing and improving agent
resilience in realistic enterprise settings.

*Soumya Rani Samineni,Durgesh Kalwar,Vardaan Gangal,Siddhant Bhambri,Subbarao Kambhampati*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文研究了基于可验证奖励的强化学习（RLVR）对大型语言模型推理轨迹的影响，发现RL后训练提高了推理步骤的局部连贯性，但这并不保证最终答案的正确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RLVR方法通常对所有token一视同仁，仅基于最终答案正确性评估性能，却声称RL后训练能改善推理轨迹。这促使我们研究RL后训练对未直接激励的中间token的影响。

Method: 使用GRPO算法和Qwen-2.5-0.5B模型在GSM8K数据集上进行实验，引入基于一阶逻辑的轨迹连贯性度量来捕捉推理步骤的一致性。

Result: RL后训练整体提高了轨迹连贯性，在基础模型失败但RL模型成功的问题上改善最显著。但RL增强了局部连贯性而不一定产生有效或正确的解决方案。

Conclusion: RL改善推理的主张需要谨慎审视，因为基于轨迹连贯性的改进可能无法转化为完全有效的数学证明，局部连贯性的提升不保证最终答案正确性。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR)-based post-training of
Large Language Models (LLMs) has been shown to improve accuracy on reasoning
tasks and continues to attract significant attention. Existing RLVR methods,
however, typically treat all tokens uniformly without accounting for
token-level advantages. These methods primarily evaluate performance based on
final answer correctness or Pass@K accuracy, and yet make claims about RL
post-training leading to improved reasoning traces. This motivates our
investigation into the effect of RL post-training on intermediate tokens which
are not directly incentivized. To study this, we design an experimental setup
using the GRPO algorithm with Qwen-2.5-0.5B model on the GSM8K dataset. We
introduce trace coherence, a First-Order Logic (FOL)-based measure to capture
the consistency of reasoning steps by identifying errors in the traces. We
distinguish between trace validity and trace coherence, noting that the former
implies logical soundness while the latter measures local coherence via lack of
errors. Our results show that RL post-training overall improves trace coherence
with the most significant gains on problems where the base model fails but the
RL model succeeds. Surprisingly, RL enhances local coherence without
necessarily producing valid or correct solutions. This highlights a crucial
distinction: improved local coherence in reasoning steps does not guarantee
final answer correctness. We argue that claims of improved reasoning via RL
must be examined with care, as these may be based on improved trace coherence,
which may not translate into fully valid mathematical proofs.

TL;DR: 提出了一个可量化的AGI评估框架，基于人类认知理论将通用智能分解为10个核心认知领域，应用该框架发现当代AI模型存在"锯齿状"认知能力分布，在知识密集型领域表现良好但在基础认知机制方面存在严重缺陷。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于缺乏对AGI的具体定义，导致当前专业AI与人类水平认知之间的差距不明确。

Method: 基于Cattell-Horn-Carroll人类认知理论，将通用智能分解为10个核心认知领域，并采用成熟的人类心理测量工具来评估AI系统。

Result: 应用该框架发现当代AI模型认知能力分布不均衡，GPT-4得分为27%，GPT-5为58%，显示出快速进步但仍存在显著差距。

Conclusion: 该框架为AGI提供了具体量化标准，揭示了当前AI在长期记忆等基础认知机制方面的关键缺陷，明确了实现AGI仍需克服的挑战。

Abstract: The lack of a concrete definition for Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)
obscures the gap between today's specialized AI and human-level cognition. This
paper introduces a quantifiable framework to address this, defining AGI as
matching the cognitive versatility and proficiency of a well-educated adult. To
operationalize this, we ground our methodology in Cattell-Horn-Carroll theory,
the most empirically validated model of human cognition. The framework dissects
general intelligence into ten core cognitive domains-including reasoning,
memory, and perception-and adapts established human psychometric batteries to
evaluate AI systems. Application of this framework reveals a highly "jagged"
cognitive profile in contemporary models. While proficient in
knowledge-intensive domains, current AI systems have critical deficits in
foundational cognitive machinery, particularly long-term memory storage. The
resulting AGI scores (e.g., GPT-4 at 27%, GPT-5 at 58%) concretely quantify
both rapid progress and the substantial gap remaining before AGI.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出ssToken方法，通过自调制损失差异和语义感知注意力机制进行token级数据选择，无需额外参考模型，在保持训练效率的同时提升SFT性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有token级选择方法需要额外参考模型且仅依赖损失信息，无法很好保留语义重要但损失指标不偏好的token

Method: 使用历史模型计算token损失差异作为自调制信号，结合注意力机制估计token语义重要性，两者互补进行token选择

Result: 自调制选择和语义感知选择单独使用均优于全数据微调，两者结合进一步超越现有token级选择方法

Conclusion: ssToken通过自调制和语义感知的token选择策略，在无需额外参考模型的情况下实现了性能提升和训练效率的平衡

Abstract: Data quality plays a critical role in enhancing supervised fine-tuning (SFT)
for large language models (LLMs), and token-level data selection has emerged as
a promising direction for its fine-grained nature. Despite their strong
empirical performance, existing token-level selection methods share two key
limitations: (1) requiring training or accessing an additional reference model,
and (2) relying solely on loss information for token selection, which cannot
well preserve semantically important tokens that are not favored by loss-based
metrics. To address these challenges, we propose ssToken, a Self-modulated and
Semantic-aware Token Selection approach. ssToken leverages readily accessible
history models to compute the per-token loss difference with the current model,
which serves as a self-modulated signal that enables the model to adaptively
select tokens along its optimization trajectory, rather than relying on excess
loss from an offline-trained reference model as in prior works. We further
introduce a semantic-aware, attention-based token importance estimation metric,
orthogonal to loss-based selection and providing complementary semantic
information for more effective filtering. Extensive experiments across
different model families and scales demonstrate that both self-modulated
selection and semantic-aware selection alone outperform full-data fine-tuning,
while their integration--ssToken--achieves synergistic gains and further
surpasses prior token-level selection methods, delivering performance
improvements while maintaining training efficiency.

*Sion Weatherhead,Flora Salim,Aaron Belbasis*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文测试了8个前沿大语言模型在开放式但规则约束的任务中的自我反思能力，发现模型反思后改进有限，经常重复相同的约束违反，表明当前LLM的反思缺乏人类那种主动、目标驱动的监控机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 验证大语言模型的反思能力是否在功能上等同于人类的反思推理，特别是在开放式但规则约束的任务中，而不仅仅是依赖外部正确性信号的封闭式任务。

Method: 让8个前沿模型执行一个简单的现实任务：生成有效的科学测试项目，然后基于自我批评进行修订。任务具有可审计的成功标准，测试模型在约束条件下的自我纠正能力。

Result: 首次尝试表现很差（平均约1个有效项目），反思后仅有小幅改进（也约1个）。关键发现是第二次尝试经常重复相同的约束违反，表明改进主要来自偶然产生有效项目而非真正的错误检测和原则性修复。

Conclusion: 当前LLM的反思缺乏人类那种主动、目标驱动的监控机制，无法在首次尝试时就尊重约束。在模型本身实现这种机制之前，可靠性能需要外部结构来强制执行约束。

Abstract: Humans do not just find mistakes after the fact -- we often catch them
mid-stream because 'reflection' is tied to the goal and its constraints.
Today's large language models produce reasoning tokens and 'reflective' text,
but is it functionally equivalent with human reflective reasoning? Prior work
on closed-ended tasks -- with clear, external 'correctness' signals -- can make
'reflection' look effective while masking limits in self-correction. We
therefore test eight frontier models on a simple, real-world task that is
open-ended yet rule-constrained, with auditable success criteria: to produce
valid scientific test items, then revise after considering their own critique.
First-pass performance is poor (often zero valid items out of 4 required; mean
$\approx$ 1), and reflection yields only modest gains (also $\approx$ 1).
Crucially, the second attempt frequently repeats the same violation of
constraint, indicating 'corrective gains' arise largely from chance production
of a valid item rather than error detection and principled,
constraint-sensitive repair. Performance before and after reflection
deteriorates as open-endedness increases, and models marketed for 'reasoning'
show no advantage. Our results suggest that current LLM 'reflection' lacks
functional evidence of the active, goal-driven monitoring that helps humans
respect constraints even on a first pass. Until such mechanisms are
instantiated in the model itself, reliable performance requires external
structure that enforces constraints.

Motivation: 随着大语言模型代理越来越多地自动化复杂网络任务，它们在提高生产力的同时引入了新的安全风险。现有红队方法主要依赖手动构建的攻击策略或离线训练的静态模型，难以捕捉网络代理的行为模式，无法在不同环境中泛化。

Method: 提出Genesis框架，包含三个模块：攻击者（Attacker）通过遗传算法和混合策略表示生成对抗性注入；评分器（Scorer）评估目标网络代理的响应提供反馈；策略师（Strategist）从交互日志中动态发现有效策略并编译到持续增长的战略库中。

Result: 在各种网络任务上的广泛实验表明，该框架能够发现新颖策略，并始终优于现有的攻击基线方法。

Conclusion: Genesis框架能够有效发现网络代理攻击策略，通过动态策略发现和持续优化的方法显著提升了攻击效果。

Abstract: As large language model (LLM) agents increasingly automate complex web tasks,
they boost productivity while simultaneously introducing new security risks.
However, relevant studies on web agent attacks remain limited. Existing
red-teaming approaches mainly rely on manually crafted attack strategies or
static models trained offline. Such methods fail to capture the underlying
behavioral patterns of web agents, making it difficult to generalize across
diverse environments. In web agent attacks, success requires the continuous
discovery and evolution of attack strategies. To this end, we propose Genesis,
a novel agentic framework composed of three modules: Attacker, Scorer, and
Strategist. The Attacker generates adversarial injections by integrating the
genetic algorithm with a hybrid strategy representation. The Scorer evaluates
the target web agent's responses to provide feedback. The Strategist
dynamically uncovers effective strategies from interaction logs and compiles
them into a continuously growing strategy library, which is then re-deployed to
enhance the Attacker's effectiveness. Extensive experiments across various web
tasks show that our framework discovers novel strategies and consistently
outperforms existing attack baselines.

TL;DR: ShortcutBreaker是一个用于多类无监督异常检测的统一特征重建框架，通过低秩噪声瓶颈和全局扰动注意力机制解决身份捷径问题，在多个数据集上取得了优异性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多类无监督异常检测需要统一模型检测多个类别的异常，但现有Transformer架构存在身份捷径问题，即直接复制输入到输出，导致正常和异常样本的重建误差差异变小，难以区分。

Method: 提出ShortcutBreaker框架：1）基于矩阵秩不等式设计低秩噪声瓶颈，将高维特征投影到低秩潜在空间，防止平凡身份复制；2）利用ViT的全局建模能力，引入全局扰动注意力防止解码器中的信息捷径。

Result: 在四个基准数据集（MVTec-AD、ViSA、Real-IAD和Universal Medical）上分别达到99.8%、98.9%、90.6%和87.8%的图像级AUROC，在所有场景下均优于先前方法。

Conclusion: ShortcutBreaker通过解决身份捷径问题，在多类无监督异常检测任务中实现了显著性能提升，证明了低秩约束和全局注意力机制的有效性。

Abstract: Multi-class unsupervised anomaly detection (MUAD) has garnered growing
research interest, as it seeks to develop a unified model for anomaly detection
across multiple classes, i.e., eliminating the need to train separate models
for distinct objects and thereby saving substantial computational resources.
Under the MUAD setting, while advanced Transformer-based architectures have
brought significant performance improvements, identity shortcuts persist: they
directly copy inputs to outputs, narrowing the gap in reconstruction errors
between normal and abnormal cases, and thereby making the two harder to
distinguish. Therefore, we propose ShortcutBreaker, a novel unified
feature-reconstruction framework for MUAD tasks, featuring two key innovations
to address the issue of shortcuts. First, drawing on matrix rank inequality, we
design a low-rank noisy bottleneck (LRNB) to project highdimensional features
into a low-rank latent space, and theoretically demonstrate its capacity to
prevent trivial identity reproduction. Second, leveraging ViTs global modeling
capability instead of merely focusing on local features, we incorporate a
global perturbation attention to prevent information shortcuts in the decoders.
Extensive experiments are performed on four widely used anomaly detection
benchmarks, including three industrial datasets (MVTec-AD, ViSA, and Real-IAD)
and one medical dataset (Universal Medical). The proposed method achieves a
remarkable image-level AUROC of 99.8%, 98.9%, 90.6%, and 87.8% on these four
datasets, respectively, consistently outperforming previous MUAD methods across
different scenarios.

Abstract: This paper proposes Memory-Augmented State Machine Prompting (MASMP), a novel
framework for LLM agents in real-time strategy games. Addressing key challenges
like hallucinations and fragmented decision-making in existing approaches,
MASMP integrates state machine prompting with memory mechanisms to unify
structured actions with long-term tactical coherence. The framework features:
(1) a natural language-driven state machine architecture that guides LLMs to
emulate finite state machines and behavior trees through prompts, and (2) a
lightweight memory module preserving strategic variables (e.g., tactics,
priority units) across decision cycles. Experiments in StarCraft II demonstrate
MASMP's 60% win rate against the hardest built-in AI (Lv7), vastly
outperforming baselines (0%). Case studies reveal the method retains LLMs'
semantic comprehension while resolving the "Knowing-Doing Gap" through strict
state-action mapping, achieving both interpretability and FSM-like reliability.
This work establishes a new paradigm for combining neural and symbolic AI in
complex decision-making.

exploit agent symmetry within zero-sum competitive settings, yet this approach
proves inadequate for open-ended learning scenarios characterized by inherent
asymmetry. Human pedagogical systems exemplify asymmetric instructional
frameworks wherein educators systematically construct challenges calibrated to
individual learners' developmental trajectories. The principal challenge
resides in operationalizing these asymmetric, adaptive pedagogical mechanisms
within artificial systems capable of autonomously synthesizing appropriate
curricula without predetermined task hierarchies. Here we present Heterogeneous
Adversarial Play (HAP), an adversarial Automatic Curriculum Learning framework
that formalizes teacher-student interactions as a minimax optimization wherein
task-generating instructor and problem-solving learner co-evolve through
adversarial dynamics. In contrast to prevailing ACL methodologies that employ
static curricula or unidirectional task selection mechanisms, HAP establishes a
bidirectional feedback system wherein instructors continuously recalibrate task
complexity in response to real-time learner performance metrics. Experimental
validation across multi-task learning domains demonstrates that our framework
achieves performance parity with SOTA baselines while generating curricula that
enhance learning efficacy in both artificial agents and human subjects.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决视觉语言模型在医学推理中存在的幻觉、模糊描述、逻辑不一致和定位差等问题。

Method: 基于视觉引导和自奖励范式，结合蒙特卡洛树搜索，使用PPO目标对VLMs进行微调。

Result: 在多个医学VQA基准测试中表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Med-VRAgent框架有效提升了医学视觉推理能力，通过树搜索和强化学习微调显著改善了VLMs的性能。

Abstract: Visual Language Models (VLMs) achieve promising results in medical reasoning
but struggle with hallucinations, vague descriptions, inconsistent logic and
poor localization. To address this, we propose a agent framework named Medical
Visual Reasoning Agent (\textbf{Med-VRAgent}). The approach is based on Visual

combining the Visual Guidance with tree search, Med-VRAgent improves the
medical visual reasoning capabilities of VLMs. We use the trajectories
collected by Med-VRAgent as feedback to further improve the performance by
fine-tuning the VLMs with the proximal policy optimization (PPO) objective.
Experiments on multiple medical VQA benchmarks demonstrate that our method
outperforms existing approaches.

TL;DR: UWAssess是一个基于基础模型的框架，通过监控图像自动识别积水区域并生成结构化评估报告，解决了城市内涝监测中数据稀缺和时效性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着气候变化加剧，城市内涝对公共安全和基础设施构成严重威胁，现有监测方法依赖人工报告，无法提供及时全面的评估。

Method: 设计了半监督微调策略和思维链提示策略，释放基础模型在数据稀缺下游任务中的潜力，构建多基础模型协作框架。

Result: 在视觉基准测试中感知性能显著提升，GPT评估确认UWAssess能生成准确描述积水范围、深度、风险和影响的可靠文本报告。

Conclusion: 该框架实现了从感知到生成的内涝监测转变，为智能可扩展系统奠定基础，支持城市管理、灾害响应和气候韧性。

Abstract: With climate change intensifying, urban waterlogging poses an increasingly
severe threat to global public safety and infrastructure. However, existing
monitoring approaches rely heavily on manual reporting and fail to provide
timely and comprehensive assessments. In this study, we present Urban
Waterlogging Assessment (UWAssess), a foundation model-driven framework that
automatically identifies waterlogged areas in surveillance images and generates
structured assessment reports. To address the scarcity of labeled data, we
design a semi-supervised fine-tuning strategy and a chain-of-thought (CoT)
prompting strategy to unleash the potential of the foundation model for
data-scarce downstream tasks. Evaluations on challenging visual benchmarks
demonstrate substantial improvements in perception performance. GPT-based
evaluations confirm the ability of UWAssess to generate reliable textual
reports that accurately describe waterlogging extent, depth, risk and impact.
This dual capability enables a shift of waterlogging monitoring from perception
to generation, while the collaborative framework of multiple foundation models
lays the groundwork for intelligent and scalable systems, supporting urban
management, disaster response and climate resilience.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AlphaOPT是一个自改进的经验库系统，使LLM能够从有限的演示和求解器反馈中学习优化建模知识，无需标注推理轨迹或参数更新。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 优化建模在各行业决策中至关重要，但难以自动化：需要将非正式语言映射为精确的数学公式和可执行的求解器代码。现有LLM方法要么依赖脆弱的提示工程，要么需要昂贵的重新训练且泛化能力有限。

Method: AlphaOPT采用持续的两阶段循环：(1) 库学习阶段：反思失败尝试，提取求解器验证的结构化洞察；(2) 库演化阶段：诊断检索错位，细化存储洞察的适用条件，提高任务间迁移能力。

Result: 实验显示AlphaOPT随数据增加持续改进（从100到300个训练项，性能从65%提升到72%），在仅使用答案训练时，在分布外OptiBench数据集上比最强基线高出7.7%。

Conclusion: 该设计能够从有限演示中高效学习，通过更新库而非模型权重实现持续扩展，使知识显式化且可解释，便于人工检查和干预。

Abstract: Optimization modeling enables critical decisions across industries but
remains difficult to automate: informal language must be mapped to precise
mathematical formulations and executable solver code. Prior LLM approaches
either rely on brittle prompting or costly retraining with limited
generalization. We present AlphaOPT, a self-improving experience library that
enables an LLM to learn from limited demonstrations (even answers alone,
without gold-standard programs) and solver feedback - without annotated
reasoning traces or parameter updates. AlphaOPT operates in a continual
two-phase cycle: (i) a Library Learning phase that reflects on failed attempts,
extracting solver-verified, structured insights as {taxonomy, condition,
explanation, example}; and (ii) a Library Evolution phase that diagnoses
retrieval misalignments and refines the applicability conditions of stored
insights, improving transfer across tasks. This design (1) learns efficiently
from limited demonstrations without curated rationales, (2) expands continually
without costly retraining by updating the library rather than model weights,
and (3) makes knowledge explicit and interpretable for human inspection and
intervention. Experiments show that AlphaOPT steadily improves with more data
(65% to 72% from 100 to 300 training items) and surpasses the strongest
baseline by 7.7% on the out-of-distribution OptiBench dataset when trained only
on answers. Code and data are available at:

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PlanU是一种基于LLM的规划方法，通过将蒙特卡洛树搜索(MCTS)与分位数分布建模相结合，解决LLM决策中的不确定性挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在不确定性环境下的决策任务中表现不佳，现有方法要么只处理LLM不确定性而忽略环境不确定性，要么无法处理需要与环境交互的多步决策任务。

Method: 在MCTS中为每个节点建模分位数分布来表示回报分布，并引入带有好奇心项的上置信界(UCC)分数来平衡探索与利用。

Result: 通过大量实验证明PlanU在不确定性LLM决策任务中的有效性。

Conclusion: PlanU成功解决了LLM决策中的不确定性挑战，特别是在随机环境中的规划任务。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being explored across a range
of decision-making tasks. However, LLMs sometimes struggle with decision-making
tasks under uncertainty that are relatively easy for humans, such as planning
actions in stochastic environments. The adoption of LLMs for decision-making is
impeded by uncertainty challenges, such as LLM uncertainty and environmental
uncertainty. LLM uncertainty arises from the stochastic sampling process
inherent to LLMs. Most LLM-based Decision-Making (LDM) approaches address LLM
uncertainty through multiple reasoning chains or search trees. However, these
approaches overlook environmental uncertainty, which leads to poor performance
in environments with stochastic state transitions. Some recent LDM approaches
deal with uncertainty by forecasting the probability of unknown variables.
However, they are not designed for multi-step decision-making tasks that
require interaction with the environment. To address uncertainty in LLM
decision-making, we introduce PlanU, an LLM-based planning method that captures
uncertainty within Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). PlanU models the return of
each node in the MCTS as a quantile distribution, which uses a set of quantiles
to represent the return distribution. To balance exploration and exploitation
during tree search, PlanU introduces an Upper Confidence Bounds with Curiosity
(UCC) score which estimates the uncertainty of MCTS nodes. Through extensive
experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of PlanU in LLM-based
decision-making tasks under uncertainty.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CircuitSeer是一种基于模型内部注意力机制的数据选择方法，通过识别关键推理电路来选择高质量训练数据，显著提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据选择方法依赖昂贵的外部模型或不透明的启发式方法，而本文转向利用模型内部机制来识别高质量推理数据。

Method: 发现复杂推理任务会激活稀疏的专用注意力头，形成核心推理电路。CircuitSeer通过测量数据对这些关键电路的影响来量化推理复杂度。

Result: 在4个模型和9个数据集上的实验表明，CircuitSeer表现优越。仅使用10% CircuitSeer选择的数据微调Qwen2.5-Math-7B，平均Pass@1比全数据集训练提升1.4个百分点。

Conclusion: CircuitSeer通过利用模型内部推理电路提供了一种高效、有效的数据选择方法，显著减少了训练数据需求同时提升模型性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive reasoning
capabilities, but scaling their performance often relies on massive reasoning
datasets that are computationally expensive to train on. Existing data
selection methods aim to curate smaller, high-quality subsets but often rely on
costly external models or opaque heuristics. In this work, we shift the focus
from external heuristics to the model's internal mechanisms. We find that
complex reasoning tasks consistently activate a sparse, specialized subset of
attention heads, forming core reasoning circuits. Building on this insight, we
propose CircuitSeer, a novel data selection method that quantifies the
reasoning complexity of data by measuring its influence on these crucial
circuits. Extensive experiments on 4 models and 9 datasets demonstrate
CircuitSeer's superiority. Notably, fine-tuning Qwen2.5-Math-7B on just 10% of
data selected by our method achieves a 1.4-point gain in average Pass@1 over
training on the full dataset, highlighting its efficiency and effectiveness.

TL;DR: 提出了一个用于多轮社交对话中LLM代理的概率意图建模框架，通过维护对伙伴潜在意图的信念分布，实现自适应对话策略


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为开发具有社会智能的LLM代理，需要能够建模和推断对话伙伴的潜在意图，以在不确定性下进行自适应对话

Method: 基于上下文先验初始化信念分布，并在每个话语后通过似然估计动态更新，为策略提供额外的上下文基础

Result: 在SOTOPIA环境中，相比Qwen2.5-7B基线，整体得分分别提高9.0%和4.1%，甚至略微超过直接观察伙伴意图的oracle代理

Conclusion: 概率意图建模可以为社会智能LLM代理的发展做出贡献

Abstract: We present a probabilistic intent modeling framework for large language model
(LLM) agents in multi-turn social dialogue. The framework maintains a belief
distribution over a partner's latent intentions, initialized from contextual
priors and dynamically updated through likelihood estimation after each
utterance. The evolving distribution provides additional contextual grounding
for the policy, enabling adaptive dialogue strategies under uncertainty.
Preliminary experiments in the SOTOPIA environment show consistent
improvements: the proposed framework increases the Overall score by 9.0% on
SOTOPIA-All and 4.1% on SOTOPIA-Hard compared with the Qwen2.5-7B baseline, and
slightly surpasses an oracle agent that directly observes partner intentions.
These early results suggest that probabilistic intent modeling can contribute
to the development of socially intelligent LLM agents.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LAFA是首个将基于LLM代理的数据分析与联邦分析相结合的系统，通过分层多代理架构将自然语言查询转换为优化的可执行FA工作流，实现隐私保护的LLM驱动分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM代理分析框架假设集中式数据访问，缺乏隐私保护；而联邦分析虽能保护隐私，但不支持自然语言输入。LAFA旨在结合两者的优势。

Method: 采用分层多代理架构：粗粒度规划器分解复杂查询为子查询，细粒度规划器将子查询映射为FA操作的有向无环图，优化器代理重写和合并多个DAG以消除冗余操作。

Result: 实验表明LAFA持续优于基线提示策略，实现了更高的执行计划成功率，并大幅减少了资源密集型的FA操作。

Conclusion: 这项工作为支持自然语言输入的联邦分析环境中的隐私保护、LLM驱动分析建立了实用基础。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown great promise in automating data
analytics tasks by interpreting natural language queries and generating
multi-operation execution plans. However, existing LLM-agent-based analytics
frameworks operate under the assumption of centralized data access, offering
little to no privacy protection. In contrast, federated analytics (FA) enables
privacy-preserving computation across distributed data sources, but lacks
support for natural language input and requires structured, machine-readable
queries. In this work, we present LAFA, the first system that integrates
LLM-agent-based data analytics with FA. LAFA introduces a hierarchical
multi-agent architecture that accepts natural language queries and transforms
them into optimized, executable FA workflows. A coarse-grained planner first
decomposes complex queries into sub-queries, while a fine-grained planner maps
each subquery into a Directed Acyclic Graph of FA operations using prior
structural knowledge. To improve execution efficiency, an optimizer agent
rewrites and merges multiple DAGs, eliminating redundant operations and
minimizing computational and communicational overhead. Our experiments
demonstrate that LAFA consistently outperforms baseline prompting strategies by
achieving higher execution plan success rates and reducing resource-intensive
FA operations by a substantial margin. This work establishes a practical
foundation for privacy-preserving, LLM-driven analytics that supports natural
language input in the FA setting.

TL;DR: StarBench是一个基于《崩坏：星穹铁道》的回合制RPG基准测试，评估视觉语言模型在从像素到动作的多模态决策和主动信息寻求方面的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类玩家能够将屏幕内容转化为精确的键盘鼠标操作，并在卡关时主动寻求信息。当前视觉语言模型是否具备类似能力仍是一个开放挑战。

Method: StarBench包含8个战斗任务和两种评估机制：直接控制（仅接收截图并输出低级操作）和工具辅助控制（可使用检测器和OCR）。还包括询问-行动诊断，测量代理何时选择请求指导。

Result: 结果显示在直接控制模式下感知到控制的保真度存在显著差距，而明智的信息寻求与改进的成功率相关。

Conclusion: StarBench为真实客户端游戏中的主动信息寻求和多模态决策提供了可复现的基准标准。

Abstract: Human players do more than press buttons: they ground what they see on screen
into precise keyboard-mouse actions and, when stuck, they seek information
before trying again. We ask whether current vision-language models (VLMs) can
do the same. Despite encouraging results under simplified control or tool
scaffolds, human-like play in a real client - mapping raw screenshots to
temporally coherent low-level actions while deciding when to ask for guidance -
remains an open challenge. We introduce StarBench, a turn-based RPG benchmark
derived from Honkai: Star Rail that targets these two human-like competencies:
multimodal decision-making from pixels to actions and agentic information
seeking. StarBench standardizes evaluation across eight combat tasks and two
regimes with shared tasks and metrics: (i) direct control, where agents receive
only screenshots and must emit low-level primitives (click and keypress) with
no semantic hints; and (ii) tool-assisted control, where higher-level intents
can be mapped to primitives by detectors and OCR outputs provide optional
textualized observations to ease UI grounding. To mirror human practice,
StarBench also includes an ask-or-act diagnostic that measures whether and when
agents choose to request brief guidance before proceeding, and how that choice
affects subsequent performance. We report reference baselines for contemporary
VLMs and a human reference. Results expose sizable gaps in
perception-to-control fidelity in the direct regime, while showing that
judicious information seeking correlates with improved success, establishing
StarBench as a reproducible yardstick for agentic information seeking and
multimodal decision-making in real-client play.

TL;DR: 研究发现现有GUI代理基准测试AndroidControl存在缺陷，通过改进创建了AndroidControl-Curated基准，在该基准上SOTA模型性能提升至75%，并开发了仅3B参数但性能媲美235B模型的Magma-R1模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有GUI代理基准测试AndroidControl中的模糊性和事实错误问题，这些缺陷系统性低估了代理的实际能力，阻碍了设备端虚拟助手的实际部署。

Method: 通过严格的净化流程改进AndroidControl基准，创建AndroidControl-Curated；使用仅2.4k精选样本在H20 GPU上训练60小时开发Magma-R1-3B模型。

Result: 在改进后的基准上，SOTA模型在复杂任务上的成功率接近75%（提升15%）；Magma-R1-3B模型虽然参数小200倍，但性能与Qwen3-VL-235B相当。

Conclusion: 设备端GUI代理实际上比之前认为的更接近实际部署，发布AndroidControl-Curated基准和Magma-R1模型以促进更准确的能力评估和稳健设备端虚拟助手的发展。

Abstract: On-device virtual assistants like Siri and Google Assistant are increasingly
pivotal, yet their capabilities are hamstrung by a reliance on rigid,
developer-dependent APIs. GUI agents offer a powerful, API-independent
alternative, but their adoption is hindered by the perception of poor
performance, as even the best models (e.g. Qwen3-VL-235B) scores are capped at
around 60% on benchmarks like AndroidControl, far from viability for real-world
use. Our research reveals that issue lies not only with the models but with the
benchmarks themselves. We identified notable shortcomings in AndroidControl,
including ambiguities and factual errors, which systematically underrates agent
capabilities. To address this critical oversight, we enhanced AndroidControl
into AndroidControl-Curated, a refined version of the benchmark improved
through a rigorous purification pipeline. On this enhanced benchmark,
state-of-the-art models achieve success rates nearing 75% on complex tasks (15%
improvement), reflecting that on-device GUI agents are actually closer to
practical deployment than previously thought. We introduce our new SOTA model,
Magma-R1- 3B, post-trained on just 2.4k curated samples using 60 hours of an
H20 GPU (approximately $60). Despite being 200 times smaller in parameters,
this model delivers performance comparable to Qwen3- VL-235B. We release both
AndroidControl-Curated benchmark and Magma-R1 model to the research community,
encouraging adoption of this enhanced benchmark to better reflect model
capabilities and accelerate the development of robust, on-device virtual
assistants.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注算法在理想或默认配置下的性能，而忽略了调优潜力这一关键维度。生产环境中的控制算法通常需要领域专家针对特定场景进行参数和逻辑调优。

Method: 采用LLM驱动的多级专家模拟方法，构建Crucible代理来调优算法，并定义形式化指标来定量评估算法的调优潜力。

Result: 实验结果表明，Crucible能够系统量化不同算法的可调优空间，在从经典控制任务到复杂计算机系统的广泛案例研究中都表现出有效性，并在真实部署中验证了其发现。

Conclusion: Crucible为算法分析和设计提供了新的维度，最终能够带来性能提升，为算法调优潜力评估提供了系统化方法。

Abstract: Control algorithms in production environments typically require domain
experts to tune their parameters and logic for specific scenarios. However,
existing research predominantly focuses on algorithmic performance under ideal
or default configurations, overlooking the critical aspect of Tuning Potential.
To bridge this gap, we introduce Crucible, an agent that employs an LLM-driven,
multi-level expert simulation to turn algorithms and defines a formalized
metric to quantitatively evaluate their Tuning Potential. We demonstrate
Crucible's effectiveness across a wide spectrum of case studies, from classic
control tasks to complex computer systems, and validate its findings in a
real-world deployment. Our experimental results reveal that Crucible
systematically quantifies the tunable space across different algorithms.
Furthermore, Crucible provides a new dimension for algorithm analysis and
design, which ultimately leads to performance improvements. Our code is

TL;DR: 提出了COUPLE框架，使用结构因果模型和反事实推理来解决大语言模型与多元人类价值观对齐的挑战，包括价值复杂性和价值可引导性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在多元文化环境中的应用，需要超越平均原则（如HHH）与多元人类价值观对齐。现有方法在处理细粒度价值目标时面临价值复杂性和价值可引导性挑战。

Method: 提出COUPLE框架，引入结构因果模型来表征特征间的复杂依赖关系和优先级，以及高层次价值维度与行为间的因果关系。应用反事实推理生成符合期望价值目标的输出。

Result: 在两个具有不同价值系统的数据集上评估，COUPLE在各类价值目标上均优于其他基线方法。

Conclusion: COUPLE通过显式因果建模提供了更好的可解释性，能够有效处理多元价值观对齐问题，在多样价值目标上表现优异。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into
applications serving users across diverse cultures, communities and
demographics, it is critical to align LLMs with pluralistic human values beyond
average principles (e.g., HHH). In psychological and social value theories such
as Schwartz's Value Theory, pluralistic values are represented by multiple
value dimensions paired with various priorities. However, existing methods
encounter two challenges when aligning with such fine-grained value objectives:
1) they often treat multiple values as independent and equally important,
ignoring their interdependence and relative priorities (value complexity); 2)
they struggle to precisely control nuanced value priorities, especially those
underrepresented ones (value steerability). To handle these challenges, we
propose COUPLE, a COUnterfactual reasoning framework for PLuralistic valuE
alignment. It introduces a structural causal model (SCM) to feature complex
interdependency and prioritization among features, as well as the causal
relationship between high-level value dimensions and behaviors. Moreover, it
applies counterfactual reasoning to generate outputs aligned with any desired
value objectives. Benefitting from explicit causal modeling, COUPLE also
provides better interpretability. We evaluate COUPLE on two datasets with
different value systems and demonstrate that COUPLE advances other baselines
across diverse types of value objectives.

Method: 使用长短时记忆网络耦合松弛水平衡约束，构建5种不同信息可用性架构，从完整历史预报到数据延迟和中断场景

Result: 在美国5000多个流域测试，包括印度高度调控河流，模拟器能重现GloFAS水文核心功能，在信息质量下降时性能平滑退化

Conclusion: 该框架将运行鲁棒性确立为水文机器学习的可测量属性，推进了可靠实时预测系统的设计

Abstract: Reliable hydrologic and flood forecasting requires models that remain stable
when input data are delayed, missing, or inconsistent. However, most advances
in rainfall-runoff prediction have been evaluated under ideal data conditions,
emphasizing accuracy rather than operational resilience. Here, we develop an
operationally ready emulator of the Global Flood Awareness System (GloFAS) that
couples long- and short-term memory networks with a relaxed water-balance
constraint to preserve physical coherence. Five architectures span a continuum
of information availability: from complete historical and forecast forcings to
scenarios with data latency and outages, allowing systematic evaluation of
robustness. Trained in minimally managed catchments across the United States
and tested in more than 5,000 basins, including heavily regulated rivers in
India, the emulator reproduces the hydrological core of GloFAS and degrades
smoothly as information quality declines. Transfer across contrasting
hydroclimatic and management regimes yields reduced yet physically consistent
performance, defining the limits of generalization under data scarcity and
human influence. The framework establishes operational robustness as a
measurable property of hydrological machine learning and advances the design of
reliable real-time forecasting systems.

Abstract: In this paper, we present SOCIA-Nabla, an end-to-end, agentic framework that
treats simulator construction asinstance optimization over code within a
textual computation graph. Specialized LLM-driven agents are embedded as graph
nodes, and a workflow manager executes a loss-driven loop: code synthesis ->
execution -> evaluation -> code repair. The optimizer performs Textual-Gradient
Descent (TGD), while human-in-the-loop interaction is reserved for task-spec
confirmation, minimizing expert effort and keeping the code itself as the
trainable object. Across three CPS tasks, i.e., User Modeling, Mask Adoption,
and Personal Mobility, SOCIA-Nabla attains state-of-the-art overall accuracy.
By unifying multi-agent orchestration with a loss-aligned optimization view,
SOCIA-Nabla converts brittle prompt pipelines into reproducible,
constraint-aware simulator code generation that scales across domains and
simulation granularities. This work is under review, and we will release the
code soon.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究表明可以从经过对齐训练后的模型中提取大量对齐训练数据，这些数据可用于改进模型的长上下文推理、安全性、指令遵循和数学能力。使用嵌入模型比传统字符串匹配方法能更有效地识别语义相似性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 揭示对齐训练数据提取的风险，展示模型容易泄露其训练数据（包括SFT和RL阶段的数据），并探讨蒸馏实践可能带来的下游影响。

Method: 使用高质量的嵌入模型来测量语义相似性，而非传统的近似字符串匹配方法，从而更准确地识别从模型中提取的训练数据。

Result: 发现模型容易重现其训练数据，这些提取的数据可用于训练基础模型，恢复相当程度的原始性能。嵌入方法比字符串匹配多识别约10倍的数据量。

Conclusion: 这项工作暴露了提取对齐数据的潜在风险，并引发了对蒸馏实践下游影响的讨论，因为模型似乎会重现其训练集的某些方面，蒸馏可被视为间接使用原始数据集进行训练。

Abstract: In this work, we show that it is possible to extract significant amounts of
alignment training data from a post-trained model -- useful to steer the model
to improve certain capabilities such as long-context reasoning, safety,
instruction following, and maths. While the majority of related work on
memorisation has focused on measuring success of training data extraction
through string matching, we argue that embedding models are better suited for
our specific goals. Distances measured through a high quality embedding model
can identify semantic similarities between strings that a different metric such
as edit distance will struggle to capture. In fact, in our investigation,
approximate string matching would have severely undercounted (by a conservative
estimate of $10\times$) the amount of data that can be extracted due to trivial
artifacts that deflate the metric. Interestingly, we find that models readily
regurgitate training data that was used in post-training phases such as SFT or
RL. We show that this data can be then used to train a base model, recovering a
meaningful amount of the original performance. We believe our work exposes a
possibly overlooked risk towards extracting alignment data. Finally, our work
opens up an interesting discussion on the downstream effects of distillation
practices: since models seem to be regurgitating aspects of their training set,
distillation can therefore be thought of as indirectly training on the model's
original dataset.

*Junhyeog Yun,Hyoun Jun Lee,Insu Jeon*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: QuantEvolve是一个结合质量-多样性优化和假设驱动策略生成的进化框架，用于自动化开发量化交易策略，能够在动态市场中保持策略多样性并适应市场变化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态市场中自动化开发量化交易策略具有挑战性，现有方法难以在探索广阔策略空间的同时保持多样性，无法满足个性化投资解决方案的需求。

Method: 使用与投资者偏好对齐的特征图（如策略类型、风险状况、换手率和收益特征）来维护多样化有效策略，并整合假设驱动的多智能体系统通过迭代生成和评估来系统探索策略空间。

Result: 实证结果显示QuantEvolve优于传统基线方法，验证了其有效性，并发布了进化策略数据集支持未来研究。

Conclusion: QuantEvolve能够产生多样化、复杂的策略，既能适应市场机制变化，又能满足个人投资需求，为量化交易策略开发提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Automating quantitative trading strategy development in dynamic markets is
challenging, especially with increasing demand for personalized investment
solutions. Existing methods often fail to explore the vast strategy space while
preserving the diversity essential for robust performance across changing
market conditions. We present QuantEvolve, an evolutionary framework that
combines quality-diversity optimization with hypothesis-driven strategy
generation. QuantEvolve employs a feature map aligned with investor
preferences, such as strategy type, risk profile, turnover, and return
characteristics, to maintain a diverse set of effective strategies. It also
integrates a hypothesis-driven multi-agent system to systematically explore the
strategy space through iterative generation and evaluation. This approach
produces diverse, sophisticated strategies that adapt to both market regime
shifts and individual investment needs. Empirical results show that QuantEvolve
outperforms conventional baselines, validating its effectiveness. We release a
dataset of evolved strategies to support future research.

*Wei Cai,Jian Zhao,Yuchen Yuan,Tianle Zhang,Ming Zhu,Haichuan Tang,Chi Zhang,Xuelong Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: VAR是一个新颖的视觉推理框架，通过结构化搜索解决多模态大语言模型的幻觉问题，在幻觉和安全基准测试中达到最先进水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型存在高幻觉倾向和脆弱的线性推理过程，导致复杂任务失败，需要解决这些限制。

Method: 将基础推理重新构建为在推理轨迹空间上的结构化搜索，分解为可追踪证据基础和基于搜索的思维链生成，包含回溯机制进行自我修正。

Result: 7B模型VAR-7B在全面的幻觉和安全基准测试中创下新纪录，显著优于现有开源模型，与领先专有系统表现相当。

Conclusion: VAR框架通过结构化搜索和自验证机制有效解决了多模态大语言模型的幻觉问题，在推理任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), despite their advances, are
hindered by their high hallucination tendency and heavy reliance on brittle,
linear reasoning processes, leading to failures in complex tasks. To address
these limitations, we introduce Visual Attention Reasoning (VAR), a novel
framework that recasts grounded reasoning as a structured search over a
reasoning trajectory space. VAR decomposes the reasoning process into two key
stages: traceable evidence grounding and search-based chain-of-thought (CoT)
generation, which incorporates a backtracking mechanism for self-correction.
The search is guided by a multi-faceted reward function with semantic and
geometric self-verification components, which penalize outputs that are not
faithfully grounded in the visual input. We provide a theoretical analysis for
our search strategy, validating its capability to find the correct solution
with high probability. Experimental results show that our 7B model, VAR-7B,
sets a new state-of-the-art on a comprehensive suite of hallucination and
safety benchmarks, significantly outperforming existing open-source models and
demonstrating competitive performance against leading proprietary systems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出一种结合数据和知识的分类方法，通过数据挖掘获取关联规则来提升树模型（决策树和随机森林）的预测性能，并改进可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统分类方法主要依赖数据，缺乏知识引导。本文旨在结合数据挖掘得到的关联规则来增强树模型的预测能力和解释性。

Method: 从数据中挖掘关联规则（可能包含否定），将这些规则融入决策树和随机森林模型，用于提升分类性能和生成更通用的溯因解释。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在两种树模型上都能提高预测性能，并生成更简洁的解释。

Conclusion: 结合数据挖掘得到的关联规则可以有效提升树模型的预测性能和解释能力，为分类任务提供更好的解决方案。

Abstract: We present a new approach to classification that combines data and knowledge.
In this approach, data mining is used to derive association rules (possibly
with negations) from data. Those rules are leveraged to increase the predictive
performance of tree-based models (decision trees and random forests) used for a
classification task. They are also used to improve the corresponding
explanation task through the generation of abductive explanations that are more
general than those derivable without taking such rules into account.
Experiments show that for the two tree-based models under consideration,
benefits can be offered by the approach in terms of predictive performance and
in terms of explanation sizes.

TL;DR: 本文研究了形式论证中定性不确定性的建模，比较了抽象模型和结构化模型在表达能力方面的差异，提出了新的表达能力概念，并给出了正负两方面的表达能力结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注抽象的不确定性论证模型，但缺乏对这些抽象模型的具体实例化研究。本文旨在填补这一空白，探索基于规则和前提的结构化论证中不确定性的建模方法。

Method: 通过将论证的不确定性基于其组成部分（规则和前提）进行结构化建模，引入能够处理抽象和结构化形式体系的表达能力概念，比较抽象论证框架（包括不完全抽象论证框架及其依赖扩展）与结构化论证框架（ASPIC+）的表达能力。

Result: 获得了正负两方面的表达能力结果，表明抽象模型和结构化模型在表达能力上存在差异，这些结果影响了不完全抽象论证框架及其依赖扩展。

Conclusion: 结构化论证框架能够更好地处理基于组件的不确定性，为形式论证中不确定性的建模提供了更实用的方法，同时揭示了抽象模型和结构化模型在表达能力上的重要区别。

Abstract: Modelling qualitative uncertainty in formal argumentation is essential both
for practical applications and theoretical understanding. Yet, most of the
existing works focus on \textit{abstract} models for arguing with uncertainty.
Following a recent trend in the literature, we tackle the open question of
studying plausible instantiations of these abstract models. To do so, we ground
the uncertainty of arguments in their components, structured within rules and
premises. Our main technical contributions are: i) the introduction of a notion
of expressivity that can handle abstract and structured formalisms, and ii) the
presentation of both negative and positive expressivity results, comparing the
expressivity of abstract and structured models of argumentation with
uncertainty. These results affect incomplete abstract argumentation frameworks,
and their extension with dependencies, on the abstract side, and ASPIC+, on the
structured side.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于多臂老虎机框架的检索增强生成系统，通过动态选择信息最丰富的子查询来平衡检索的广度和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决RAG系统中在检索文档时需要平衡的两个关键问题：既要检索足够广泛以捕获所有相关材料，又要限制检索以避免过度噪声和计算成本。

Method: 将查询分解和文档检索建模为利用-探索问题，使用各种老虎机学习方法动态选择最有信息的子查询，并利用排名信息和人工判断来估计文档相关性。

Result: 使用排名信息和人工判断估计文档相关性，在文档级精确度上获得35%的提升，α-nDCG提高15%，并在长文本生成的下游任务中表现更好。

Conclusion: 基于老虎机学习的动态子查询选择方法能有效提高RAG系统的检索效率和生成质量，平衡了检索的广度和精度需求。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems address complex user requests by
decomposing them into subqueries, retrieving potentially relevant documents for
each, and then aggregating them to generate an answer. Efficiently selecting
informative documents requires balancing a key trade-off: (i) retrieving
broadly enough to capture all the relevant material, and (ii) limiting
retrieval to avoid excessive noise and computational cost. We formulate query
decomposition and document retrieval in an exploitation-exploration setting,
where retrieving one document at a time builds a belief about the utility of a
given sub-query and informs the decision to continue exploiting or exploring an
alternative. We experiment with a variety of bandit learning methods and
demonstrate their effectiveness in dynamically selecting the most informative
sub-queries. Our main finding is that estimating document relevance using rank
information and human judgments yields a 35% gain in document-level precision,
15% increase in {\alpha}-nDCG, and better performance on the downstream task of
long-form generation.

TL;DR: SherlockLLM是一个基于强化学习的对话检索框架，通过生成二进制问题序列来高效缩小搜索空间，解决了传统交互式检索系统缺乏明确提问策略的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 信息检索中的用户查询往往存在歧义，而现有的对话式交互检索系统缺乏明确的提问策略，导致澄清用户意图的效率低下。

Method: 采用强化学习训练智能体生成二进制问题序列，无需大规模标注对话数据，通过优化提问策略来高效缩小搜索空间。

Result: 在结构化任务中表现与强基线相当，接近二分搜索的理论最优；在非结构化任务中显著优于基线，展示了学习高效信息寻求对话策略的能力。

Conclusion: SherlockLLM是一个鲁棒且高效的解决方案，能够学习到高度有效的信息寻求对话策略，在挑战性任务中表现出色。

Abstract: User queries in information retrieval are often ambiguous, making it
challenging for systems to identify a user's target from a single query. While
recent dialogue-based interactive retrieval systems can clarify user intent,
they are inefficient as they often lack an explicit strategy to ask the most
informative questions. To address this limitation, we propose SherlockLLM, a
dialogue-driven retrieval framework that learns an optimal questioning strategy
via Reinforcement Learning (RL) and avoids the need for large-scale annotated
dialogue data. In our framework, an agent is trained to generate a sequence of
binary questions to efficiently narrow down the search space. To validate our
approach, we introduce a benchmark with both structured and unstructured tasks.
Experimental results show that SherlockLLM is a robust and efficient solution.
On the structured tasks, its performance matches strong baselines and
approaches the theoretical optimal defined by binary search. On the challenging
unstructured task, our agent significantly outperforms these baselines,
showcasing its ability to learn a highly effective information-seeking dialogue
policy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 气候变化加剧有害藻华发生，传统监测方法劳动密集且覆盖有限，需要可扩展的AI驱动解决方案

Method: 集成GeoSAM辅助人工评估进行高质量分割掩码整理，并在NASA的CAML数据集上微调视觉语言模型进行严重程度预测

Result: ALGOS在分割和严重程度级别估计方面均取得稳健性能

Conclusion: 为实用和自动化的蓝藻监测系统铺平道路

Abstract: Climate change is intensifying the occurrence of harmful algal bloom (HAB),
particularly cyanobacteria, which threaten aquatic ecosystems and human health
through oxygen depletion, toxin release, and disruption of marine biodiversity.
Traditional monitoring approaches, such as manual water sampling, remain
labor-intensive and limited in spatial and temporal coverage. Recent advances
in vision-language models (VLMs) for remote sensing have shown potential for
scalable AI-driven solutions, yet challenges remain in reasoning over imagery
and quantifying bloom severity. In this work, we introduce ALGae Observation
and Segmentation (ALGOS), a segmentation-and-reasoning system for HAB
monitoring that combines remote sensing image understanding with severity
estimation. Our approach integrates GeoSAM-assisted human evaluation for
high-quality segmentation mask curation and fine-tunes vision language model on
severity prediction using the Cyanobacteria Aggregated Manual Labels (CAML)
from NASA. Experiments demonstrate that ALGOS achieves robust performance on
both segmentation and severity-level estimation, paving the way toward
practical and automated cyanobacterial monitoring systems.

Motivation: 优化国家科学投资需要了解研究趋势演变及人口地理因素的影响，特别是在关注公平、多样性和包容性的背景下。

Method: 比较了LDA、STM和BERTopic三种主题建模方法，并开发了COFFEE算法来为BERTopic提供协变量效应估计功能。

Abstract: Optimizing national scientific investment requires a clear understanding of
evolving research trends and the demographic and geographical forces shaping
them, particularly in light of commitments to equity, diversity, and inclusion.
This study addresses this need by analyzing 18 years (2005-2022) of research
proposals funded by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of
Canada (NSERC). We conducted a comprehensive comparative evaluation of three
topic modelling approaches: Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), Structural Topic
Modelling (STM), and BERTopic. We also introduced a novel algorithm, named
COFFEE, designed to enable robust covariate effect estimation for BERTopic.
This advancement addresses a significant gap, as BERTopic lacks a native
function for covariate analysis, unlike the probabilistic STM. Our findings
highlight that while all models effectively delineate core scientific domains,
BERTopic outperformed by consistently identifying more granular, coherent, and
emergent themes, such as the rapid expansion of artificial intelligence.
Additionally, the covariate analysis, powered by COFFEE, confirmed distinct
provincial research specializations and revealed consistent gender-based
thematic patterns across various scientific disciplines. These insights offer a
robust empirical foundation for funding organizations to formulate more
equitable and impactful funding strategies, thereby enhancing the effectiveness
of the scientific ecosystem.
