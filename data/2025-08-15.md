### [1] [Stochastic-based Patch Filtering for Few-Shot Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10066)
*Javier Rodenas,Eduardo Aguilar,Petia Radeva*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于随机性补丁过滤的少样本学习方法（SPFF），用于解决食物图像因视觉复杂性和多样性导致的分类问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 食物图像的视觉复杂性和多样性导致少样本学习模型在分类时容易丢失关键信息，从而产生误分类。

Method: 通过随机过滤补丁嵌入，保留与类别表示相关性高的补丁，并使用相似性矩阵量化查询图像与支持图像的关系。

Result: 在Food-101、VireoFood-172和UECFood-256等基准测试中，SPFF优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SPFF能有效聚焦于类别特异性食物特征，过滤无关补丁，提升分类性能。

Abstract: Food images present unique challenges for few-shot learning models due to
their visual complexity and variability. For instance, a pasta dish might
appear with various garnishes on different plates and in diverse lighting
conditions and camera perspectives. This problem leads to losing focus on the
most important elements when comparing the query with support images, resulting
in misclassification. To address this issue, we propose Stochastic-based Patch
Filtering for Few-Shot Learning (SPFF) to attend to the patch embeddings that
show greater correlation with the class representation. The key concept of SPFF
involves the stochastic filtering of patch embeddings, where patches less
similar to the class-aware embedding are more likely to be discarded. With
patch embedding filtered according to the probability of appearance, we use a
similarity matrix that quantifies the relationship between the query image and
its respective support images. Through a qualitative analysis, we demonstrate
that SPFF effectively focuses on patches where class-specific food features are
most prominent while successfully filtering out non-relevant patches. We
validate our approach through extensive experiments on few-shot classification
benchmarks: Food-101, VireoFood-172 and UECFood-256, outperforming the existing
SoA methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DINOv3通过数据扩展、Gram anchoring和优化策略，提出了一种无需微调的高性能自监督视觉基础模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 消除手动数据标注需求，实现跨领域视觉表征学习。

Method: 结合数据扩展、Gram anchoring和优化策略，提升模型性能。

Result: DINOv3在多种视觉任务中表现优异，超越现有自监督和弱监督模型。

Conclusion: DINOv3为视觉任务提供了灵活且高性能的解决方案。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning holds the promise of eliminating the need for manual
data annotation, enabling models to scale effortlessly to massive datasets and
larger architectures. By not being tailored to specific tasks or domains, this
training paradigm has the potential to learn visual representations from
diverse sources, ranging from natural to aerial images -- using a single
algorithm. This technical report introduces DINOv3, a major milestone toward
realizing this vision by leveraging simple yet effective strategies. First, we
leverage the benefit of scaling both dataset and model size by careful data
preparation, design, and optimization. Second, we introduce a new method called
Gram anchoring, which effectively addresses the known yet unsolved issue of
dense feature maps degrading during long training schedules. Finally, we apply
post-hoc strategies that further enhance our models' flexibility with respect
to resolution, model size, and alignment with text. As a result, we present a
versatile vision foundation model that outperforms the specialized state of the
art across a broad range of settings, without fine-tuning. DINOv3 produces
high-quality dense features that achieve outstanding performance on various
vision tasks, significantly surpassing previous self- and weakly-supervised
foundation models. We also share the DINOv3 suite of vision models, designed to
advance the state of the art on a wide spectrum of tasks and data by providing
scalable solutions for diverse resource constraints and deployment scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种多模态学习方法，用于生成变形攻击检测的文本描述，并通过零样本评估验证了其泛化能力和文本预测能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 变形攻击检测是确保人脸识别系统可靠性的关键，本文旨在通过多模态学习提供更直观的文本描述。

Method: 采用对比语言-图像预训练（CLIP）进行零样本评估，设计了十种文本提示，并结合预训练神经网络进行实验。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在零样本评估中表现优异，能够泛化检测变形攻击并预测相关文本片段。

Conclusion: 多模态学习方法为变形攻击检测提供了新的视角，结合文本描述增强了检测的可解释性。

Abstract: Morphing attack detection has become an essential component of face
recognition systems for ensuring a reliable verification scenario. In this
paper, we present a multimodal learning approach that can provide a textual
description of morphing attack detection. We first show that zero-shot
evaluation of the proposed framework using Contrastive Language-Image
Pretraining (CLIP) can yield not only generalizable morphing attack detection,
but also predict the most relevant text snippet. We present an extensive
analysis of ten different textual prompts that include both short and long
textual prompts. These prompts are engineered by considering the human
understandable textual snippet. Extensive experiments were performed on a face
morphing dataset that was developed using a publicly available face biometric
dataset. We present an evaluation of SOTA pre-trained neural networks together
with the proposed framework in the zero-shot evaluation of five different
morphing generation techniques that are captured in three different mediums.

### [4] [Interpretable Oracle Bone Script Decipherment through Radical and Pictographic Analysis with LVLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10113)
*Kaixin Peng,Mengyang Zhao,Haiyang Yu,Teng Fu,Bin Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于大型视觉语言模型的可解释甲骨文破译方法，结合部首分析和象形语义理解，显著提升了零样本破译性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 甲骨文因其稀有性、抽象性和象形多样性，破译难度大，现有深度学习方法忽略了字形与语义的复杂联系，导致泛化性和可解释性不足。

Method: 采用渐进式训练策略，从部首识别到象形分析，设计了部首-象形双重匹配机制，并构建了包含47,157个字符的数据集。

Result: 在公开基准测试中达到Top-10准确率，零样本破译能力优异，并提供逻辑分析过程。

Conclusion: 该方法为未破译甲骨文提供了考古学参考，具有数字人文和历史研究的应用潜力。

Abstract: As the oldest mature writing system, Oracle Bone Script (OBS) has long posed
significant challenges for archaeological decipherment due to its rarity,
abstractness, and pictographic diversity. Current deep learning-based methods
have made exciting progress on the OBS decipherment task, but existing
approaches often ignore the intricate connections between glyphs and the
semantics of OBS. This results in limited generalization and interpretability,
especially when addressing zero-shot settings and undeciphered OBS. To this
end, we propose an interpretable OBS decipherment method based on Large
Vision-Language Models, which synergistically combines radical analysis and
pictograph-semantic understanding to bridge the gap between glyphs and meanings
of OBS. Specifically, we propose a progressive training strategy that guides
the model from radical recognition and analysis to pictographic analysis and
mutual analysis, thus enabling reasoning from glyph to meaning. We also design
a Radical-Pictographic Dual Matching mechanism informed by the analysis
results, significantly enhancing the model's zero-shot decipherment
performance. To facilitate model training, we propose the Pictographic
Decipherment OBS Dataset, which comprises 47,157 Chinese characters annotated
with OBS images and pictographic analysis texts. Experimental results on public
benchmarks demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art Top-10
accuracy and superior zero-shot decipherment capabilities. More importantly,
our model delivers logical analysis processes, possibly providing
archaeologically valuable reference results for undeciphered OBS, and thus has
potential applications in digital humanities and historical research. The
dataset and code will be released in https://github.com/PKXX1943/PD-OBS.

### [5] [Deep Learning Enables Large-Scale Shape and Appearance Modeling in Total-Body DXA Imaging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10132)
*Arianna Bunnell,Devon Cataldi,Yannik Glaser,Thomas K. Wolfgruber,Steven Heymsfield,Alan B. Zonderman,Thomas L. Kelly,Peter Sadowski,John A. Shepherd*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 开发了一种基于深度学习的自动标记方法，用于全身双能X射线吸收测定（TBDXA）扫描，验证了其在外部测试数据集中的高准确性（99.5%），并展示了其在形状和外观建模（SAM）中的应用价值。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: TBDXA是一种低成本的全身体组成评估方法，但手动标记关键点耗时且易出错，因此需要自动化解决方案。

Method: 使用1,683个手动标注的TBDXA扫描训练深度学习模型，自动放置关键点，并在外部测试数据集中验证其准确性。

Result: 模型在外部测试数据集中达到99.5%的关键点正确率，并成功应用于35,928次扫描的SAM分析，揭示了体组成与健康标志物的关联。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅验证了现有研究，还提出了新的假设，为体组成与健康关系的研究提供了工具和数据支持。

Abstract: Total-body dual X-ray absorptiometry (TBDXA) imaging is a relatively low-cost
whole-body imaging modality, widely used for body composition assessment. We
develop and validate a deep learning method for automatic fiducial point
placement on TBDXA scans using 1,683 manually-annotated TBDXA scans. The method
achieves 99.5% percentage correct keypoints in an external testing dataset. To
demonstrate the value for shape and appearance modeling (SAM), our method is
used to place keypoints on 35,928 scans for five different TBDXA imaging modes,
then associations with health markers are tested in two cohorts not used for
SAM model generation using two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests. SAM feature
distributions associated with health biomarkers are shown to corroborate
existing evidence and generate new hypotheses on body composition and shape's
relationship to various frailty, metabolic, inflammation, and cardiometabolic
health markers. Evaluation scripts, model weights, automatic point file
generation code, and triangulation files are available at

### [6] [MANGO: Multimodal Attention-based Normalizing Flow Approach to Fusion Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10133)
*Thanh-Dat Truong,Christophe Bobda,Nitin Agarwal,Khoa Luu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的多模态注意力归一化流（MANGO）方法，通过可逆交叉注意力层（ICA）和三种新的交叉注意力机制，显式、可解释地学习多模态数据的复杂相关性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态融合方法依赖Transformer的注意力机制隐式学习特征相关性，难以捕捉模态本质特征和复杂结构。

Method: 提出可逆交叉注意力层（ICA）和三种新交叉注意力机制（MMCA、IMCA、LICA），并引入多模态注意力归一化流以扩展至高维数据。

Result: 在语义分割、图像到图像翻译和电影类型分类三个任务中实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: MANGO方法显式、可解释地学习多模态数据相关性，性能优越。

Abstract: Multimodal learning has gained much success in recent years. However, current
multimodal fusion methods adopt the attention mechanism of Transformers to
implicitly learn the underlying correlation of multimodal features. As a
result, the multimodal model cannot capture the essential features of each
modality, making it difficult to comprehend complex structures and correlations
of multimodal inputs. This paper introduces a novel Multimodal Attention-based
Normalizing Flow (MANGO) approach\footnote{The source code of this work will be
publicly available.} to developing explicit, interpretable, and tractable
multimodal fusion learning. In particular, we propose a new Invertible
Cross-Attention (ICA) layer to develop the Normalizing Flow-based Model for
multimodal data. To efficiently capture the complex, underlying correlations in
multimodal data in our proposed invertible cross-attention layer, we propose
three new cross-attention mechanisms: Modality-to-Modality Cross-Attention
(MMCA), Inter-Modality Cross-Attention (IMCA), and Learnable Inter-Modality
Cross-Attention (LICA). Finally, we introduce a new Multimodal Attention-based
Normalizing Flow to enable the scalability of our proposed method to
high-dimensional multimodal data. Our experimental results on three different
multimodal learning tasks, i.e., semantic segmentation, image-to-image
translation, and movie genre classification, have illustrated the
state-of-the-art (SoTA) performance of the proposed approach.

### [7] [Improving watermelon (Citrullus lanatus) disease classification with generative artificial intelligence (GenAI)-based synthetic and real-field images via a custom EfficientNetV2-L model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10156)
*Nitin Rai,Nathan S. Boyd,Gary E. Vallad,Arnold W. Schumann*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究探讨了结合少量真实图像与合成图像是否能提升西瓜病害分类模型的性能，结果显示混合使用显著提高了模型表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估生成式AI模型在农业病害诊断中的潜力，减少对资源密集型实地数据收集的依赖。

Method: 使用EfficientNetV2-L模型，比较五种不同真实与合成图像比例的训练数据集（H0-H4）。

Result: 混合真实与合成图像的训练（H3-H4）显著提升了模型精度和泛化能力，F1分数从0.65提升至1.00。

Conclusion: 合成图像无法完全替代真实图像，混合使用能最大化模型性能。

Abstract: The current advancements in generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) models
have paved the way for new possibilities for generating high-resolution
synthetic images, thereby offering a promising alternative to traditional image
acquisition for training computer vision models in agriculture. In the context
of crop disease diagnosis, GenAI models are being used to create synthetic
images of various diseases, potentially facilitating model creation and
reducing the dependency on resource-intensive in-field data collection.
However, limited research has been conducted on evaluating the effectiveness of
integrating real with synthetic images to improve disease classification
performance. Therefore, this study aims to investigate whether combining a
limited number of real images with synthetic images can enhance the prediction
accuracy of an EfficientNetV2-L model for classifying watermelon
\textit{(Citrullus lanatus)} diseases. The training dataset was divided into
five treatments: H0 (only real images), H1 (only synthetic images), H2 (1:1
real-to-synthetic), H3 (1:10 real-to-synthetic), and H4 (H3 + random images to
improve variability and model generalization). All treatments were trained
using a custom EfficientNetV2-L architecture with enhanced fine-tuning and
transfer learning techniques. Models trained on H2, H3, and H4 treatments
demonstrated high precision, recall, and F1-score metrics. Additionally, the
weighted F1-score increased from 0.65 (on H0) to 1.00 (on H3-H4) signifying
that the addition of a small number of real images with a considerable volume
of synthetic images improved model performance and generalizability. Overall,
this validates the findings that synthetic images alone cannot adequately
substitute for real images; instead, both must be used in a hybrid manner to
maximize model performance for crop disease classification.

### [8] [SynSpill: Improved Industrial Spill Detection With Synthetic Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10171)
*Aaditya Baranwal,Abdul Mueez,Jason Voelker,Guneet Bhatia,Shruti Vyas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于合成数据的框架，用于提升大规模视觉语言模型（VLMs）在工业泄漏检测等安全关键领域的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业泄漏检测等领域的真实数据稀缺且敏感，传统微调方法难以适用，因此需要一种可扩展的解决方案。

Method: 通过高质量合成数据生成管道，结合参数高效微调（PEFT）技术，优化VLMs和目标检测器（如YOLO和DETR）。

Result: 合成数据显著提升了VLMs和检测器的性能，使其在未见过的泄漏场景中表现更优，且性能接近。

Conclusion: 高保真合成数据是弥合安全关键领域性能差距的有效手段，结合轻量级适配方法，为工业环境中的视觉系统部署提供了经济高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Large-scale Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have transformed general-purpose
visual recognition through strong zero-shot capabilities. However, their
performance degrades significantly in niche, safety-critical domains such as
industrial spill detection, where hazardous events are rare, sensitive, and
difficult to annotate. This scarcity -- driven by privacy concerns, data
sensitivity, and the infrequency of real incidents -- renders conventional
fine-tuning of detectors infeasible for most industrial settings.
  We address this challenge by introducing a scalable framework centered on a
high-quality synthetic data generation pipeline. We demonstrate that this
synthetic corpus enables effective Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) of
VLMs and substantially boosts the performance of state-of-the-art object
detectors such as YOLO and DETR. Notably, in the absence of synthetic data
(SynSpill dataset), VLMs still generalize better to unseen spill scenarios than
these detectors. When SynSpill is used, both VLMs and detectors achieve marked
improvements, with their performance becoming comparable.
  Our results underscore that high-fidelity synthetic data is a powerful means
to bridge the domain gap in safety-critical applications. The combination of
synthetic generation and lightweight adaptation offers a cost-effective,
scalable pathway for deploying vision systems in industrial environments where
real data is scarce/impractical to obtain.

### [9] [EntropyGS: An Efficient Entropy Coding on 3D Gaussian Splatting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10227)
*Yuning Huang,Jiahao Pang,Fengqing Zhu,Dong Tian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 3D高斯泼溅（3DGS）是一种新兴的视图合成方法，具有快速训练/渲染和高质量视觉效果的优点。本文提出了一种名为EntropyGS的因子化和参数化熵编码方法，用于压缩3DGS高斯属性，实现了约30倍的码率降低，同时保持相似的渲染质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3DGS的高斯创建和视图渲染通常在不同时间或设备上完成，因此需要存储/传输和压缩高斯数据。本文旨在通过分析高斯属性的相关性并提出高效的压缩方法来解决这一问题。

Method: 首先对3DGS高斯属性进行相关性和统计分析，发现球谐AC属性遵循拉普拉斯分布，而旋转、缩放和不透明度可以用高斯混合分布近似。基于此，提出了一种因子化和参数化的熵编码方法EntropyGS，根据高斯属性类型自适应地进行量化。

Result: EntropyGS在基准数据集上实现了约30倍的码率降低，同时保持与原始3DGS数据相似的渲染质量，且编码和解码速度快。

Conclusion: EntropyGS是一种高效的3DGS高斯属性压缩方法，适用于实际应用中的存储和传输需求。

Abstract: As an emerging novel view synthesis approach, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)
demonstrates fast training/rendering with superior visual quality. The two
tasks of 3DGS, Gaussian creation and view rendering, are typically separated
over time or devices, and thus storage/transmission and finally compression of
3DGS Gaussians become necessary. We begin with a correlation and statistical
analysis of 3DGS Gaussian attributes. An inspiring finding in this work reveals
that spherical harmonic AC attributes precisely follow Laplace distributions,
while mixtures of Gaussian distributions can approximate rotation, scaling, and
opacity. Additionally, harmonic AC attributes manifest weak correlations with
other attributes except for inherited correlations from a color space. A
factorized and parameterized entropy coding method, EntropyGS, is hereinafter
proposed. During encoding, distribution parameters of each Gaussian attribute
are estimated to assist their entropy coding. The quantization for entropy
coding is adaptively performed according to Gaussian attribute types. EntropyGS
demonstrates about 30x rate reduction on benchmark datasets while maintaining
similar rendering quality compared to input 3DGS data, with a fast encoding and
decoding time.

Conclusion: 展示了基础模型和多模态融合在解析复杂组织生态系统中的潜力。

Abstract: Xenium, a new spatial transcriptomics platform, enables
subcellular-resolution profiling of complex tumor tissues. Despite the rich
morphological information in histology images, extracting robust cell-level
features and integrating them with spatial transcriptomics data remains a
critical challenge. We introduce CellSymphony, a flexible multimodal framework
that leverages foundation model-derived embeddings from both Xenium
transcriptomic profiles and histology images at true single-cell resolution. By
learning joint representations that fuse spatial gene expression with
morphological context, CellSymphony achieves accurate cell type annotation and
uncovers distinct microenvironmental niches across three cancer types. This
work highlights the potential of foundation models and multimodal fusion for
deciphering the physiological and phenotypic orchestration of cells within
complex tissue ecosystems.

Abstract: Crack detection plays a crucial role in civil infrastructures, including
inspection of pavements, buildings, etc., and deep learning has significantly
advanced this field in recent years. While numerous technical and review papers
exist in this domain, emerging trends are reshaping the landscape. These shifts
include transitions in learning paradigms (from fully supervised learning to
semi-supervised, weakly-supervised, unsupervised, few-shot, domain adaptation
and fine-tuning foundation models), improvements in generalizability (from
single-dataset performance to cross-dataset evaluation), and diversification in
dataset reacquisition (from RGB images to specialized sensor-based data). In
this review, we systematically analyze these trends and highlight
representative works. Additionally, we introduce a new dataset collected with
3D laser scans, 3DCrack, to support future research and conduct extensive
benchmarking experiments to establish baselines for commonly used deep learning
methodologies, including recent foundation models. Our findings provide
insights into the evolving methodologies and future directions in deep
learning-based crack detection. Project page:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MRFD是一种无需训练的解码方法，通过多区域融合减少视觉语言模型的幻觉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型视觉语言模型（LVLMs）因视觉输入验证能力有限而产生的幻觉问题。

Method: 提出Multi-Region Fusion Decoding（MRFD），利用交叉注意力识别显著区域，生成初始响应，并通过Jensen-Shannon Divergence（JSD）计算可靠性权重，进行一致性融合。

Result: 实验表明，MRFD显著减少幻觉并提高响应的事实性，且无需模型更新。

Conclusion: MRFD是一种有效的训练无关方法，可提升LVLMs的事实性表现。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have shown strong performance across
multimodal tasks. However, they often produce hallucinations -- text that is
inconsistent with visual input, due to the limited ability to verify
information in different regions of the image. To address this, we propose
Multi-Region Fusion Decoding (MRFD), a training-free decoding method that
improves factual grounding by modeling inter-region consistency. MRFD
identifies salient regions using cross-attention, generates initial responses
for each, and computes reliability weights based on Jensen-Shannon Divergence
(JSD) among the responses. These weights guide a consistency-aware fusion of
per-region predictions, using region-aware prompts inspired by Chain-of-Thought
reasoning. Experiments across multiple LVLMs and benchmarks show that MRFD
significantly reduces hallucinations and improves response factuality without
requiring model updates.

*Yujie Zhao,Jiabei Zeng,Shiguang Shan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文研究了基于外观的视线点（PoG）估计中个人差异和头部姿态变化的问题，提出了动态校准策略以提升估计器的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有PoG估计器因个人差异和头部姿态变化导致泛化能力不足，需改进校准方法以提高准确性。

Method: 构建MobilePoG基准，分析校准点和头部姿态多样性对精度的影响，提出动态校准策略。

Result: 实验表明，校准时引入更多头部姿态变化能提升估计器对姿态变化的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 动态校准策略在用户友好且高效的过程中显著提升了PoG估计器的性能。

Abstract: Although appearance-based point-of-gaze (PoG) estimation has improved, the
estimators still struggle to generalize across individuals due to personal
differences. Therefore, person-specific calibration is required for accurate
PoG estimation. However, calibrated PoG estimators are often sensitive to head
pose variations. To address this, we investigate the key factors influencing
calibrated estimators and explore pose-robust calibration strategies.
Specifically, we first construct a benchmark, MobilePoG, which includes facial
images from 32 individuals focusing on designated points under either fixed or
continuously changing head poses. Using this benchmark, we systematically
analyze how the diversity of calibration points and head poses influences
estimation accuracy. Our experiments show that introducing a wider range of
head poses during calibration improves the estimator's ability to handle pose
variation. Building on this insight, we propose a dynamic calibration strategy
in which users fixate on calibration points while moving their phones. This
strategy naturally introduces head pose variation during a user-friendly and
efficient calibration process, ultimately producing a better calibrated PoG
estimator that is less sensitive to head pose variations than those using
conventional calibration strategies. Codes and datasets are available at our
project page.

*Danyi Gao*

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合文本-图像对比约束和结构引导机制的高保真图像生成方法，解决了现有方法在语义对齐和结构一致性上的瓶颈。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本驱动图像生成方法在语义对齐准确性和结构一致性上存在性能瓶颈。

Method: 集成文本-图像对比约束与结构引导机制，引入对比学习模块和结构先验（如语义布局图或边缘草图），联合优化对比损失、结构一致性损失和语义保留损失。

Result: 在COCO-2014数据集上验证，量化指标（CLIP Score、FID、SSIM）显示方法在语义对齐和结构保真度上表现优越。

Conclusion: 该方法在不增加计算复杂度的情况下，有效弥合了语义对齐与结构保真度之间的差距，为联合文本-图像建模和图像生成提供了可行技术路径。

Abstract: This paper addresses the performance bottlenecks of existing text-driven
image generation methods in terms of semantic alignment accuracy and structural
consistency. A high-fidelity image generation method is proposed by integrating
text-image contrastive constraints with structural guidance mechanisms. The
approach introduces a contrastive learning module that builds strong
cross-modal alignment constraints to improve semantic matching between text and
image. At the same time, structural priors such as semantic layout maps or edge
sketches are used to guide the generator in spatial-level structural modeling.
This enhances the layout completeness and detail fidelity of the generated
images. Within the overall framework, the model jointly optimizes contrastive
loss, structural consistency loss, and semantic preservation loss. A
multi-objective supervision mechanism is adopted to improve the semantic
consistency and controllability of the generated content. Systematic
experiments are conducted on the COCO-2014 dataset. Sensitivity analyses are
performed on embedding dimensions, text length, and structural guidance
strength. Quantitative metrics confirm the superior performance of the proposed
method in terms of CLIP Score, FID, and SSIM. The results show that the method
effectively bridges the gap between semantic alignment and structural fidelity
without increasing computational complexity. It demonstrates a strong ability
to generate semantically clear and structurally complete images, offering a
viable technical path for joint text-image modeling and image generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 花样滑冰跳跃识别需要专家知识，现有TAS方法因数据不足和忽略三维特性及程序结构而受限。

Method: 提出VIFSS方法，结合对比学习和动作分类，构建FS-Jump3D数据集，并引入细粒度标注方案。

Conclusion: 新框架有效解决了花样滑冰跳跃识别的挑战，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Understanding human actions from videos plays a critical role across various
domains, including sports analytics. In figure skating, accurately recognizing
the type and timing of jumps a skater performs is essential for objective
performance evaluation. However, this task typically requires expert-level
knowledge due to the fine-grained and complex nature of jump procedures. While
recent approaches have attempted to automate this task using Temporal Action
Segmentation (TAS), there are two major limitations to TAS for figure skating:
the annotated data is insufficient, and existing methods do not account for the
inherent three-dimensional aspects and procedural structure of jump actions. In
this work, we propose a new TAS framework for figure skating jumps that
explicitly incorporates both the three-dimensional nature and the semantic
procedure of jump movements. First, we propose a novel View-Invariant, Figure
Skating-Specific pose representation learning approach (VIFSS) that combines
contrastive learning as pre-training and action classification as fine-tuning.
For view-invariant contrastive pre-training, we construct FS-Jump3D, the first
publicly available 3D pose dataset specialized for figure skating jumps.
Second, we introduce a fine-grained annotation scheme that marks the ``entry
(preparation)'' and ``landing'' phases, enabling TAS models to learn the
procedural structure of jumps. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of our framework. Our method achieves over 92% F1@50 on
element-level TAS, which requires recognizing both jump types and rotation
levels. Furthermore, we show that view-invariant contrastive pre-training is
particularly effective when fine-tuning data is limited, highlighting the
practicality of our approach in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: We present a multi-head vision transformer approach for multi-label plant
species prediction in vegetation plot images, addressing the PlantCLEF 2025
challenge. The task involves training models on single-species plant images
while testing on multi-species quadrat images, creating a drastic domain shift.

Abstract: Recent advances in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and large language models
(LLMs) have greatly enhanced visual reasoning, a key capability for embodied AI
agents like robots. However, existing visual reasoning benchmarks often suffer
from several limitations: they lack a clear definition of reasoning complexity,
offer have no control to generate questions over varying difficulty and task
customization, and fail to provide structured, step-by-step reasoning
annotations (workflows). To bridge these gaps, we formalize reasoning
complexity, introduce an adaptive query engine that generates customizable
questions of varying complexity with detailed intermediate annotations, and
extend the JRDB dataset with human-object interaction and geometric
relationship annotations to create JRDB-Reasoning, a benchmark tailored for
visual reasoning in human-crowded environments. Our engine and benchmark enable
fine-grained evaluation of visual reasoning frameworks and dynamic assessment
of visual-language models across reasoning levels.

### [18] [A Sub-Pixel Multimodal Optical Remote Sensing Images Matching Method](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10294)
*Tao Huang,Hongbo Pan,Nanxi Zhou,Shun Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于相位一致性加权最小绝对偏差（PCWLAD）的亚像素模板匹配方法，显著提高了多模态光学图像的匹配精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态光学图像匹配精度常因非线性辐射和几何形变差异而降低，需解决此问题。

Method: 方法分为粗匹配（使用SSIM）和精细匹配（使用WLAD），结合相位一致性和互结构滤波。

Result: 在三种数据集上表现优于现有八种方法，平均匹配精度约0.4像素。

Conclusion: PCWLAD方法在多模态图像匹配中具有高精度和鲁棒性。

Abstract: High-accuracy matching of multimodal optical images is the basis of geometric
processing. However, the image matching accuracy is usually degraded by the
nonlinear radiation and geometric deformation differences caused by different
spectral responses. To address these problems, we proposed a phase consistency
weighted least absolute deviation (PCWLAD) sub-pixel template matching method
to improve the matching accuracy of multimodal optical images. This method
consists of two main steps: coarse matching with the structural similarity
index measure (SSIM) and fine matching with WLAD. In the coarse matching step,
PCs are calculated without a noise filter to preserve the original structural
details, and template matching is performed using the SSIM. In the fine
matching step, we applied the radiometric and geometric transformation models
between two multimodal PC templates based on the coarse matching. Furthermore,
mutual structure filtering is adopted in the model to mitigate the impact of
noise within the corresponding templates on the structural consistency, and the
WLAD criterion is used to estimate the sub-pixel offset. To evaluate the
performance of PCWLAD, we created three types of image datasets: visible to
infrared Landsat images, visible to near-infrared close-range images, and
visible to infrared uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV) images. PCWLAD outperformed
existing state-of-the-art eight methods in terms of correct matching rate (CMR)
and root mean square error (RMSE) and reached an average matching accuracy of
approximately 0.4 pixels across all three datasets. Our software and datasets
are publicly available at https://github.com/huangtaocsu/PCWLAD.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常将单人及多人动态分开处理，无法捕捉真实场景中的自然交互与协调。InterSyn旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 框架包含两个模块：INS模块统一建模单人及交互行为，REC模块优化角色间的动态协调。

Result: 实验表明，InterSyn生成的运动序列在文本对齐性和多样性上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: InterSyn为自然运动合成设定了新基准，未来将开源代码以推动研究。

Abstract: We present Interleaved Learning for Motion Synthesis (InterSyn), a novel
framework that targets the generation of realistic interaction motions by
learning from integrated motions that consider both solo and multi-person
dynamics. Unlike previous methods that treat these components separately,
InterSyn employs an interleaved learning strategy to capture the natural,
dynamic interactions and nuanced coordination inherent in real-world scenarios.
Our framework comprises two key modules: the Interleaved Interaction Synthesis
(INS) module, which jointly models solo and interactive behaviors in a unified
paradigm from a first-person perspective to support multiple character
interactions, and the Relative Coordination Refinement (REC) module, which
refines mutual dynamics and ensures synchronized motions among characters.
Experimental results show that the motion sequences generated by InterSyn
exhibit higher text-to-motion alignment and improved diversity compared with
recent methods, setting a new benchmark for robust and natural motion
synthesis. Additionally, our code will be open-sourced in the future to promote
further research and development in this area.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI安全关注增加，OoD检测和分割的需求上升，但传统方法缺乏空间定位能力，限制了其应用。

Method: 将OoD分割方法分为四类：测试时分割、监督训练的异常暴露、基于重建的方法及利用强大模型的方法。

Result: 系统回顾了自动驾驶场景中的OoD分割进展，指出了新兴挑战。

Conclusion: OoD分割对自动驾驶等安全关键应用至关重要，未来研究需进一步解决挑战。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OoD) detection and segmentation have attracted growing
attention as concerns about AI security rise. Conventional OoD detection
methods identify the existence of OoD objects but lack spatial localization,
limiting their usefulness in downstream tasks. OoD segmentation addresses this
limitation by localizing anomalous objects at pixel-level granularity. This
capability is crucial for safety-critical applications such as autonomous
driving, where perception modules must not only detect but also precisely
segment OoD objects, enabling targeted control actions and enhancing overall
system robustness. In this survey, we group current OoD segmentation approaches
into four categories: (i) test-time OoD segmentation, (ii) outlier exposure for
supervised training, (iii) reconstruction-based methods, (iv) and approaches
that leverage powerful models. We systematically review recent advances in OoD
segmentation for autonomous-driving scenarios, identify emerging challenges,
and discuss promising future research directions.

Result: RL在提升生成任务的可控性、一致性和人类对齐方面表现出有效性。

Conclusion: RL与生成模型的结合仍有挑战，未来研究需进一步探索其在高层次目标对齐中的应用。

Abstract: Generative models have made significant progress in synthesizing visual
content, including images, videos, and 3D/4D structures. However, they are
typically trained with surrogate objectives such as likelihood or
reconstruction loss, which often misalign with perceptual quality, semantic
accuracy, or physical realism. Reinforcement learning (RL) offers a principled
framework for optimizing non-differentiable, preference-driven, and temporally
structured objectives. Recent advances demonstrate its effectiveness in
enhancing controllability, consistency, and human alignment across generative
tasks. This survey provides a systematic overview of RL-based methods for
visual content generation. We review the evolution of RL from classical control
to its role as a general-purpose optimization tool, and examine its integration
into image, video, and 3D/4D generation. Across these domains, RL serves not
only as a fine-tuning mechanism but also as a structural component for aligning
generation with complex, high-level goals. We conclude with open challenges and
future research directions at the intersection of RL and generative modeling.

Result: 在10+基准测试上平均提升0.9%，技能相关子集提升1.5%。

Conclusion: 强调指令选择中需平衡概念知识与视觉技能的获取。

Abstract: Vision-language instruction tuning achieves two main purposes: learning
visual concepts and learning visual skills. In this paper, we found that
vision-language benchmarks fall into the dichotomy of mainly benefiting from
training on instructions with similar skills or visual concepts. Inspired by
the discovery, we designed a simple targeted training data selection method to
optimize the performance of a given benchmark. We first extract the
concepts/skills from the benchmark, determine whether the benchmark
predominantly benefits from similar concepts or skills, and finally select
instructions with the most matching concepts/skills. Experiments on 10+
benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our targeted data selection method,
showing +0.9\% over the best existing baseline averaged over all benchmarks and
+1.5\% on the skill-focused subset. Our findings underscore the importance of
recognizing the inherent trade-off within instruction selection, which requires
balancing the acquisition of conceptual knowledge against visual skill.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前研究多集中于单一超微结构识别，难以满足实际诊断需求，因此需要一种能同时量化多种特征的高效工具。

Method: 基于三个深度学习模型：超微结构分割模型、肾小球滤过屏障区域分类模型和电子致密沉积物检测模型，量化肾小球基底膜厚度、足突消失程度和电子致密沉积物位置。

Conclusion: Glo-DMU为肾脏病理学家提供了一种全自动、高效的工具，能同时量化多种超微结构特征。

Abstract: Complex and diverse ultrastructural features can indicate the type,
progression, and prognosis of kidney diseases. Recently, computational
pathology combined with deep learning methods has shown tremendous potential in
advancing automatic morphological analysis of glomerular ultrastructure.
However, current research predominantly focuses on the recognition of
individual ultrastructure, which makes it challenging to meet practical
diagnostic needs. In this study, we propose the glomerular morphometry
framework of ultrastructural characterization (Glo-DMU), which is grounded on
three deep models: the ultrastructure segmentation model, the glomerular
filtration barrier region classification model, and the electron-dense deposits
detection model. Following the conventional protocol of renal biopsy diagnosis,
this framework simultaneously quantifies the three most widely used
ultrastructural features: the thickness of glomerular basement membrane, the
degree of foot process effacement, and the location of electron-dense deposits.
We evaluated the 115 patients with 9 renal pathological types in real-world
diagnostic scenarios, demonstrating good consistency between automatic
quantification results and morphological descriptions in the pathological
reports. Glo-DMU possesses the characteristics of full automation, high
precision, and high throughput, quantifying multiple ultrastructural features
simultaneously, and providing an efficient tool for assisting renal
pathologists.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以明确分离STEM数据中的空间漂移和辐射损伤效应，导致材料动态解析困难。

Method: 提出AtomDiffuser框架，通过预测仿射变换和空间变化衰减图，分离漂移和辐射效应，并利用合成数据训练模型。

Result: 模型在合成和真实cryo-STEM数据上表现良好，支持高分辨率降解推断和漂移对齐。

Conclusion: AtomDiffuser提供了解释性强的降解模式可视化与量化工具，有助于研究辐射诱导的原子不稳定性。

Abstract: Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) plays a critical role in
modern materials science, enabling direct imaging of atomic structures and
their evolution under external interferences. However, interpreting
time-resolved STEM data remains challenging due to two entangled degradation
effects: spatial drift caused by mechanical and thermal instabilities, and
beam-induced signal loss resulting from radiation damage. These factors distort
both geometry and intensity in complex, temporally correlated ways, making it
difficult for existing methods to explicitly separate their effects or model
material dynamics at atomic resolution. In this work, we present AtomDiffuser,
a time-aware degradation modeling framework that disentangles sample drift and
radiometric attenuation by predicting an affine transformation and a spatially
varying decay map between any two STEM frames. Unlike traditional denoising or
registration pipelines, our method leverages degradation as a physically
heuristic, temporally conditioned process, enabling interpretable structural
evolutions across time. Trained on synthetic degradation processes,
AtomDiffuser also generalizes well to real-world cryo-STEM data. It further
supports high-resolution degradation inference and drift alignment, offering
tools for visualizing and quantifying degradation patterns that correlate with
radiation-induced atomic instabilities.

Result: 部分模型近似人类CSF形状或幅度，但无一完全复制两者；提示措辞对响应影响显著。

Conclusion: 该方法为探测多模态模型的视觉敏感性提供了新框架，揭示了其与人类感知的关键差距。

Abstract: Assessing the alignment of multimodal vision-language models~(VLMs) with
human perception is essential to understand how they perceive low-level visual
features. A key characteristic of human vision is the contrast sensitivity
function (CSF), which describes sensitivity to spatial frequency at
low-contrasts. Here, we introduce a novel behavioral psychophysics-inspired
method to estimate the CSF of chat-based VLMs by directly prompting them to
judge pattern visibility at different contrasts for each frequency. This
methodology is closer to the real experiments in psychophysics than the
previously reported. Using band-pass filtered noise images and a diverse set of
prompts, we assess model responses across multiple architectures. We find that
while some models approximate human-like CSF shape or magnitude, none fully
replicate both. Notably, prompt phrasing has a large effect on the responses,
raising concerns about prompt stability. Our results provide a new framework
for probing visual sensitivity in multimodal models and reveal key gaps between
their visual representations and human perception.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种通过联合生成图像及其内在属性（如深度、分割图）的方法，以解决现有图像生成模型在空间一致性和布局上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像生成模型依赖图像-文本对或显式条件输入，导致生成图像空间不一致和失真。利用内在场景属性（如深度、分割图）可以更自然地捕捉场景结构。

Method: 从预训练估计器中提取内在属性，通过自编码器聚合为单一潜在变量，基于预训练的潜在扩散模型（LDM）同时去噪图像和内在属性域。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能纠正空间不一致性，生成更自然的场景布局，同时保持基础模型（如Stable Diffusion）的保真度和文本对齐性。

Conclusion: 联合生成图像和内在属性可显著提升生成图像的空间一致性和真实性。

Abstract: Image generation models trained on large datasets can synthesize high-quality
images but often produce spatially inconsistent and distorted images due to
limited information about the underlying structures and spatial layouts. In
this work, we leverage intrinsic scene properties (e.g., depth, segmentation
maps) that provide rich information about the underlying scene, unlike prior
approaches that solely rely on image-text pairs or use intrinsics as
conditional inputs. Our approach aims to co-generate both images and their
corresponding intrinsics, enabling the model to implicitly capture the
underlying scene structure and generate more spatially consistent and realistic
images. Specifically, we first extract rich intrinsic scene properties from a
large image dataset with pre-trained estimators, eliminating the need for
additional scene information or explicit 3D representations. We then aggregate
various intrinsic scene properties into a single latent variable using an
autoencoder. Building upon pre-trained large-scale Latent Diffusion Models
(LDMs), our method simultaneously denoises the image and intrinsic domains by
carefully sharing mutual information so that the image and intrinsic reflect
each other without degrading image quality. Experimental results demonstrate
that our method corrects spatial inconsistencies and produces a more natural
layout of scenes while maintaining the fidelity and textual alignment of the
base model (e.g., Stable Diffusion).

TL;DR: NSegment+是一种新的数据增强框架，通过解耦图像和标签变换来处理语义分割中的隐式标签噪声，显著提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实数据集中存在隐式标签噪声（如模糊边界和标注者差异），传统数据增强方法可能放大这些噪声，影响模型泛化能力。

Method: NSegment+仅对分割标签施加弹性变形，保持原始图像不变，以学习更鲁棒的物体结构表示。

Result: 在多个数据集（Vaihingen、LoveDA等）上平均mIoU提升显著，最高达+3.39。结合其他训练技巧（如CutMix）效果更佳。

Conclusion: NSegment+有效解决了隐式标签噪声问题，为语义分割提供了更鲁棒的训练方法。

Abstract: While previous studies on image segmentation focus on handling severe (or
explicit) label noise, real-world datasets also exhibit subtle (or implicit)
label imperfections. These arise from inherent challenges, such as ambiguous
object boundaries and annotator variability. Although not explicitly present,
such mild and latent noise can still impair model performance. Typical data
augmentation methods, which apply identical transformations to the image and
its label, risk amplifying these subtle imperfections and limiting the model's
generalization capacity. In this paper, we introduce NSegment+, a novel
augmentation framework that decouples image and label transformations to
address such realistic noise for semantic segmentation. By introducing
controlled elastic deformations only to segmentation labels while preserving
the original images, our method encourages models to focus on learning robust
representations of object structures despite minor label inconsistencies.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that NSegment+ consistently improves
performance, achieving mIoU gains of up to +2.29, +2.38, +1.75, and +3.39 in
average on Vaihingen, LoveDA, Cityscapes, and PASCAL VOC, respectively-even
without bells and whistles, highlighting the importance of addressing implicit
label noise. These gains can be further amplified when combined with other
training tricks, including CutMix and Label Smoothing.

Motivation: 现有模型在真实场景中泛化能力不足，主要由于数据标注成本高和训练数据与部署条件间的域偏移问题。

Method: 使用渐进条件扩散模型（PCDMs）生成多样训练样本，并引入基于CogVLM的样本质量评估模块过滤低质量样本。

Conclusion: PQ-DAF为解决数据稀缺和域偏移问题提供了一种有效方法，提升了驾驶员分心检测的实用性。

Abstract: Driver distraction detection is essential for improving traffic safety and
reducing road accidents. However, existing models often suffer from degraded
generalization when deployed in real-world scenarios. This limitation primarily
arises from the few-shot learning challenge caused by the high cost of data
annotation in practical environments, as well as the substantial domain shift
between training datasets and target deployment conditions. To address these
issues, we propose a Pose-driven Quality-controlled Data Augmentation Framework
(PQ-DAF) that leverages a vision-language model for sample filtering to
cost-effectively expand training data and enhance cross-domain robustness.
Specifically, we employ a Progressive Conditional Diffusion Model (PCDMs) to
accurately capture key driver pose features and synthesize diverse training
examples. A sample quality assessment module, built upon the CogVLM
vision-language model, is then introduced to filter out low-quality synthetic
samples based on a confidence threshold, ensuring the reliability of the
augmented dataset. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PQ-DAF substantially
improves performance in few-shot driver distraction detection, achieving
significant gains in model generalization under data-scarce conditions.

Motivation: 当前T2I扩散模型在生成图像时，难以抑制与某些词汇强关联的内容（如生成‘查理·卓别林’时总会出现‘胡子’），影响了生成图像的灵活性。

Method: 提出了一种delta向量修改文本嵌入空间，并通过零样本方法获取该向量；进一步提出SSDV方法，将delta向量应用于交叉注意力机制，优化个性化T2I模型中的抑制效果。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在定量和定性指标上均显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了T2I模型中内容强关联问题，提升了生成图像的灵活性和精确性。

Abstract: Text-to-Image (T2I) diffusion models have made significant progress in
generating diverse high-quality images from textual prompts. However, these
models still face challenges in suppressing content that is strongly entangled
with specific words. For example, when generating an image of ``Charlie
Chaplin", a ``mustache" consistently appears even if explicitly instructed not
to include it, as the concept of ``mustache" is strongly entangled with
``Charlie Chaplin". To address this issue, we propose a novel approach to
directly suppress such entangled content within the text embedding space of
diffusion models. Our method introduces a delta vector that modifies the text
embedding to weaken the influence of undesired content in the generated image,
and we further demonstrate that this delta vector can be easily obtained
through a zero-shot approach. Furthermore, we propose a Selective Suppression
with Delta Vector (SSDV) method to adapt delta vector into the cross-attention
mechanism, enabling more effective suppression of unwanted content in regions
where it would otherwise be generated. Additionally, we enabled more precise
suppression in personalized T2I models by optimizing delta vector, which
previous baselines were unable to achieve. Extensive experimental results
demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing methods, both
in terms of quantitative and qualitative metrics.

TL;DR: SC-Lane是一种新颖的3D车道检测框架，通过动态融合坡度特征和保持时间一致性，显著提高了高度估计和车道检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖固定坡度锚点，难以适应多样化的道路几何形状，因此需要一种更鲁棒的高度估计框架。

Method: 提出Slope-Aware Adaptive Feature模块动态预测权重，融合多坡度特征；Height Consistency模块确保时间一致性。

Result: 在OpenLane基准测试中，SC-Lane以64.3%的F-score达到最先进性能，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SC-Lane通过动态坡度特征融合和时间一致性，为3D车道检测提供了更鲁棒和准确的解决方案。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce SC-Lane, a novel slope-aware and temporally
consistent heightmap estimation framework for 3D lane detection. Unlike
previous approaches that rely on fixed slope anchors, SC-Lane adaptively
determines the fusion of slope-specific height features, improving robustness
to diverse road geometries. To achieve this, we propose a Slope-Aware Adaptive
Feature module that dynamically predicts the appropriate weights from image
cues for integrating multi-slope representations into a unified heightmap.
Additionally, a Height Consistency Module enforces temporal coherence, ensuring
stable and accurate height estimation across consecutive frames, which is
crucial for real-world driving scenarios. To evaluate the effectiveness of
SC-Lane, we employ three standardized metrics-Mean Absolute Error(MAE), Root
Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and threshold-based accuracy-which, although common
in surface and depth estimation, have been underutilized for road height
assessment. Using the LiDAR-derived heightmap dataset introduced in prior work
[20], we benchmark our method under these metrics, thereby establishing a
rigorous standard for future comparisons. Extensive experiments on the OpenLane
benchmark demonstrate that SC-Lane significantly improves both height
estimation and 3D lane detection, achieving state-of-the-art performance with
an F-score of 64.3%, outperforming existing methods by a notable margin. For

TL;DR: NanoControl提出了一种高效的基于DiT的可控文本到图像生成方法，通过LoRA风格控制模块和KV-Context增强机制，显著降低了计算开销，同时保持了生成质量和可控性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于DiT的可控文本到图像生成方法依赖ControlNet范式，导致参数和计算成本高。

Method: 采用Flux作为骨干网络，设计LoRA风格控制模块和KV-Context增强机制，直接学习控制信号并融合条件特征。

Result: NanoControl仅增加0.024%参数和0.029% GFLOPs，实现了高效可控生成，并在基准测试中表现优异。

Conclusion: NanoControl在降低计算开销的同时，保持了高质量生成和更强的可控性。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in
text-to-image synthesis. However, in the domain of controllable text-to-image
generation using DiTs, most existing methods still rely on the ControlNet
paradigm originally designed for UNet-based diffusion models. This paradigm
introduces significant parameter overhead and increased computational costs. To
address these challenges, we propose the Nano Control Diffusion Transformer
(NanoControl), which employs Flux as the backbone network. Our model achieves
state-of-the-art controllable text-to-image generation performance while
incurring only a 0.024\% increase in parameter count and a 0.029\% increase in
GFLOPs, thus enabling highly efficient controllable generation. Specifically,
rather than duplicating the DiT backbone for control, we design a LoRA-style
(low-rank adaptation) control module that directly learns control signals from
raw conditioning inputs. Furthermore, we introduce a KV-Context Augmentation
mechanism that integrates condition-specific key-value information into the
backbone in a simple yet highly effective manner, facilitating deep fusion of
conditional features. Extensive benchmark experiments demonstrate that
NanoControl significantly reduces computational overhead compared to
conventional control approaches, while maintaining superior generation quality
and achieving improved controllability.

TL;DR: STRIDE-QA是一个大规模视觉问答数据集，用于自动驾驶中的时空推理，填补了现有视觉语言模型在动态场景理解上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型基于静态图像-文本对训练，难以支持动态交通场景的精确时空推理。

Method: 构建STRIDE-QA数据集，包含100小时多传感器驾驶数据，提供1600万问答对和3D标注，支持对象中心和自我中心推理。

Result: 微调后的视觉语言模型在空间定位和未来运动预测上表现显著提升（55%和28%），而通用模型接近零分。

Conclusion: STRIDE-QA为开发更可靠的自动驾驶视觉语言模型奠定了基础。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have been applied to autonomous driving to
support decision-making in complex real-world scenarios. However, their
training on static, web-sourced image-text pairs fundamentally limits the
precise spatiotemporal reasoning required to understand and predict dynamic
traffic scenes. We address this critical gap with STRIDE-QA, a large-scale
visual question answering (VQA) dataset for physically grounded reasoning from
an ego-centric perspective. Constructed from 100 hours of multi-sensor driving
data in Tokyo, capturing diverse and challenging conditions, STRIDE-QA is the
largest VQA dataset for spatiotemporal reasoning in urban driving, offering 16
million QA pairs over 285K frames. Grounded by dense, automatically generated
annotations including 3D bounding boxes, segmentation masks, and multi-object
tracks, the dataset uniquely supports both object-centric and ego-centric
reasoning through three novel QA tasks that require spatial localization and
temporal prediction. Our benchmarks demonstrate that existing VLMs struggle
significantly, achieving near-zero scores on prediction consistency. In
contrast, VLMs fine-tuned on STRIDE-QA exhibit dramatic performance gains,
achieving 55% success in spatial localization and 28% consistency in future
motion prediction, compared to near-zero scores from general-purpose VLMs.
Therefore, STRIDE-QA establishes a comprehensive foundation for developing more
reliable VLMs for safety-critical autonomous systems.

TL;DR: CRISP提出了一种新的持续视频实例分割方法，通过对比残差注入和语义提示解决实例级、类别级和任务级混淆问题。

Motivation: 持续视频实例分割需要同时吸收新类别并保留旧类别，同时保持帧间时序一致性。

Result: 在YouTube-VIS数据集上显著优于现有方法，避免了灾难性遗忘，提升了分割和分类性能。

Conclusion: CRISP为持续视频实例分割提供了一种有效解决方案，代码已开源。

Abstract: Continual video instance segmentation demands both the plasticity to absorb
new object categories and the stability to retain previously learned ones, all
while preserving temporal consistency across frames. In this work, we introduce
Contrastive Residual Injection and Semantic Prompting (CRISP), an earlier
attempt tailored to address the instance-wise, category-wise, and task-wise
confusion in continual video instance segmentation. For instance-wise learning,
we model instance tracking and construct instance correlation loss, which
emphasizes the correlation with the prior query space while strengthening the
specificity of the current task query. For category-wise learning, we build an
adaptive residual semantic prompt (ARSP) learning framework, which constructs a
learnable semantic residual prompt pool generated by category text and uses an
adjustive query-prompt matching mechanism to build a mapping relationship
between the query of the current task and the semantic residual prompt.
Meanwhile, a semantic consistency loss based on the contrastive learning is
introduced to maintain semantic coherence between object queries and residual
prompts during incremental training. For task-wise learning, to ensure the
correlation at the inter-task level within the query space, we introduce a
concise yet powerful initialization strategy for incremental prompts. Extensive
experiments on YouTube-VIS-2019 and YouTube-VIS-2021 datasets demonstrate that
CRISP significantly outperforms existing continual segmentation methods in the
long-term continual video instance segmentation task, avoiding catastrophic
forgetting and effectively improving segmentation and classification
performance. The code is available at https://github.com/01upup10/CRISP.

Result: 在DroneVehicle数据集上表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DOD-SA通过单模态标注实现了高效的红外-可见光目标检测，为实际应用提供了低成本解决方案。

Abstract: Infrared-visible object detection has shown great potential in real-world
applications, enabling robust all-day perception by leveraging the
complementary information of infrared and visible images. However, existing
methods typically require dual-modality annotations to output detection results
for both modalities during prediction, which incurs high annotation costs. To
address this challenge, we propose a novel infrared-visible Decoupled Object
Detection framework with Single-modality Annotations, called DOD-SA. The
architecture of DOD-SA is built upon a Single- and Dual-Modality Collaborative
Teacher-Student Network (CoSD-TSNet), which consists of a single-modality
branch (SM-Branch) and a dual-modality decoupled branch (DMD-Branch). The
teacher model generates pseudo-labels for the unlabeled modality,
simultaneously supporting the training of the student model. The collaborative
design enables cross-modality knowledge transfer from the labeled modality to
the unlabeled modality, and facilitates effective SM-to-DMD branch supervision.
To further improve the decoupling ability of the model and the pseudo-label
quality, we introduce a Progressive and Self-Tuning Training Strategy (PaST)
that trains the model in three stages: (1) pretraining SM-Branch, (2) guiding
the learning of DMD-Branch by SM-Branch, and (3) refining DMD-Branch. In
addition, we design a Pseudo Label Assigner (PLA) to align and pair labels
across modalities, explicitly addressing modality misalignment during training.
Extensive experiments on the DroneVehicle dataset demonstrate that our method
outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA).

Motivation: 传统电气布局图缺乏机器可读性，导致大规模解析耗时且易错，因此需要自动化解决方案。

Method: 使用预训练的目标检测模型（如YOLOv8）在标注的DELP数据集上进行符号识别，并开发了SkeySpot工具。

Result: YOLOv8在DELP数据集上表现最佳，mAP达82.5%，SkeySpot能实时检测并分类电气符号。

Conclusion: 该方法降低了建筑行业对专有CAD系统的依赖，支持标准化和可持续发展。

Abstract: Legacy floor plans, often preserved only as scanned documents, remain
essential resources for architecture, urban planning, and facility management
in the construction industry. However, the lack of machine-readable floor plans
render large-scale interpretation both time-consuming and error-prone.
Automated symbol spotting offers a scalable solution by enabling the
identification of service key symbols directly from floor plans, supporting
workflows such as cost estimation, infrastructure maintenance, and regulatory
compliance. This work introduces a labelled Digitised Electrical Layout Plans
(DELP) dataset comprising 45 scanned electrical layout plans annotated with
2,450 instances across 34 distinct service key classes. A systematic evaluation
framework is proposed using pretrained object detection models for DELP
dataset. Among the models benchmarked, YOLOv8 achieves the highest performance
with a mean Average Precision (mAP) of 82.5\%. Using YOLOv8, we develop
SkeySpot, a lightweight, open-source toolkit for real-time detection,
classification, and quantification of electrical symbols. SkeySpot produces
structured, standardised outputs that can be scaled up for interoperable
building information workflows, ultimately enabling compatibility across
downstream applications and regulatory platforms. By lowering dependency on
proprietary CAD systems and reducing manual annotation effort, this approach
makes the digitisation of electrical layouts more accessible to small and
medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the construction industry, while supporting
broader goals of standardisation, interoperability, and sustainability in the
built environment.

Result: V1层编码器与人类感知判断高度相关，且在适度噪声、模糊和稀疏条件下表现最佳。

Conclusion: 视觉系统可能针对特定失真水平优化，生物启发模型无需人工监督即可学习感知度量。

Abstract: A number of scientists suggested that human visual perception may emerge from
image statistics, shaping efficient neural representations in early vision. In
this work, a bio-inspired architecture that can accommodate several known facts
in the retina-V1 cortex, the PerceptNet, has been end-to-end optimized for
different tasks related to image reconstruction: autoencoding, denoising,
deblurring, and sparsity regularization. Our results show that the encoder
stage (V1-like layer) consistently exhibits the highest correlation with human
perceptual judgments on image distortion despite not using perceptual
information in the initialization or training. This alignment exhibits an
optimum for moderate noise, blur and sparsity. These findings suggest that the
visual system may be tuned to remove those particular levels of distortion with
that level of sparsity and that biologically inspired models can learn
perceptual metrics without human supervision.

Method: 提出TS-Mamba方法，包括轨迹构建和轨迹感知移位Mamba聚合模块（TSMA），利用Hilbert扫描和移位操作增强空间连续性，并通过轨迹感知损失函数监督训练。

Result: 在三个广泛使用的VSR测试数据集上，TS-Mamba在多数情况下优于六种基准模型，并减少22.7%的计算复杂度（MACs）。

Conclusion: TS-Mamba通过结合长时轨迹建模和低复杂度Mamba，实现了高效的时空信息聚合，显著提升了在线视频超分辨率的性能。

Abstract: Online video super-resolution (VSR) is an important technique for many
real-world video processing applications, which aims to restore the current
high-resolution video frame based on temporally previous frames. Most of the
existing online VSR methods solely employ one neighboring previous frame to
achieve temporal alignment, which limits long-range temporal modeling of
videos. Recently, state space models (SSMs) have been proposed with linear
computational complexity and a global receptive field, which significantly
improve computational efficiency and performance. In this context, this paper
presents a novel online VSR method based on Trajectory-aware Shifted SSMs
(TS-Mamba), leveraging both long-term trajectory modeling and low-complexity
Mamba to achieve efficient spatio-temporal information aggregation.
Specifically, TS-Mamba first constructs the trajectories within a video to
select the most similar tokens from the previous frames. Then, a
Trajectory-aware Shifted Mamba Aggregation (TSMA) module consisting of proposed
shifted SSMs blocks is employed to aggregate the selected tokens. The shifted
SSMs blocks are designed based on Hilbert scannings and corresponding shift
operations to compensate for scanning losses and strengthen the spatial
continuity of Mamba. Additionally, we propose a trajectory-aware loss function
to supervise the trajectory generation, ensuring the accuracy of token
selection when training our model. Extensive experiments on three widely used
VSR test datasets demonstrate that compared with six online VSR benchmark
models, our TS-Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance in most cases and
over 22.7\% complexity reduction (in MACs). The source code for TS-Mamba will
be available at https://github.com.

Conclusion: 领域随机化与自编码器质量控制结合，为标记数据稀缺场景下的半监督分割提供了有效解决方案，有望减轻标注负担。

Abstract: Deep learning segmentation relies heavily on labeled data, but manual
labeling is laborious and time-consuming, especially for volumetric images such
as brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). While recent domain-randomization
techniques alleviate the dependency on labeled data by synthesizing diverse
training images from label maps, they offer limited anatomical variability when
very few label maps are available. Semi-supervised self-training addresses
label scarcity by iteratively incorporating model predictions into the training
set, enabling networks to learn from unlabeled data. In this work, we combine
domain randomization with self-training to train three-dimensional
skull-stripping networks using as little as a single labeled example. First, we
automatically bin voxel intensities, yielding labels we use to synthesize
images for training an initial skull-stripping model. Second, we train a
convolutional autoencoder (AE) on the labeled example and use its
reconstruction error to assess the quality of brain masks predicted for
unlabeled data. Third, we select the top-ranking pseudo-labels to fine-tune the
network, achieving skull-stripping performance on out-of-distribution data that
approaches models trained with more labeled images. We compare AE-based ranking
to consistency-based ranking under test-time augmentation, finding that the AE
approach yields a stronger correlation with segmentation accuracy. Our results
highlight the potential of combining domain randomization and AE-based quality
control to enable effective semi-supervised segmentation from extremely limited
labeled data. This strategy may ease the labeling burden that slows progress in
studies involving new anatomical structures or emerging imaging techniques.

Conclusion: 研究结果为未来mmWave雷达在人类动作识别中的应用提供了重要指导。

Abstract: Human Action Recognition (HAR) plays a crucial role in healthcare, fitness
tracking, and ambient assisted living technologies. While traditional vision
based HAR systems are effective, they pose privacy concerns. mmWave radar
sensors offer a privacy preserving alternative but present challenges due to
the sparse and noisy nature of their point cloud data. In the literature, three
primary data processing methods: Density-Based Spatial Clustering of
Applications with Noise (DBSCAN), the Hungarian Algorithm, and Kalman Filtering
have been widely used to improve the quality and continuity of radar data.
However, a comprehensive evaluation of these methods, both individually and in
combination, remains lacking. This paper addresses that gap by conducting a
detailed performance analysis of the three methods using the MiliPoint dataset.
We evaluate each method individually, all possible pairwise combinations, and
the combination of all three, assessing both recognition accuracy and
computational cost. Furthermore, we propose targeted enhancements to the
individual methods aimed at improving accuracy. Our results provide crucial
insights into the strengths and trade-offs of each method and their
integrations, guiding future work on mmWave based HAR systems

Motivation: STAS是肺腺癌中的一种新型侵袭模式，与肿瘤复发和生存率降低相关，但其诊断因病理特征复杂且易被误诊而具有挑战性，亟需深度学习辅助。

Method: 研究收集了多中心病理图像数据集，并开发了STAMP框架，采用双分支架构、Transformer编码和多模式注意力聚合模块，动态选择STAS相关区域并抑制噪声。

Result: STAMP在三个数据集上的AUC分别为0.8058、0.8017和0.7928，表现优于临床水平。

Conclusion: STAMP框架为STAS诊断提供了高效且准确的解决方案，具有临床实用潜力。

Abstract: Spread through air spaces (STAS) constitutes a novel invasive pattern in lung
adenocarcinoma (LUAD), associated with tumor recurrence and diminished survival
rates. However, large-scale STAS diagnosis in LUAD remains a labor-intensive
endeavor, compounded by the propensity for oversight and misdiagnosis due to
its distinctive pathological characteristics and morphological features.
Consequently, there is a pressing clinical imperative to leverage deep learning
models for STAS diagnosis. This study initially assembled histopathological
images from STAS patients at the Second Xiangya Hospital and the Third Xiangya
Hospital of Central South University, alongside the TCGA-LUAD cohort. Three
senior pathologists conducted cross-verification annotations to construct the
STAS-SXY, STAS-TXY, and STAS-TCGA datasets. We then propose a multi-pattern
attention-aware multiple instance learning framework, named STAMP, to analyze
and diagnose the presence of STAS across multi-center histopathology images.
Specifically, the dual-branch architecture guides the model to learn
STAS-associated pathological features from distinct semantic spaces.
Transformer-based instance encoding and a multi-pattern attention aggregation
modules dynamically selects regions closely associated with STAS pathology,
suppressing irrelevant noise and enhancing the discriminative power of global
representations. Moreover, a similarity regularization constraint prevents
feature redundancy across branches, thereby improving overall diagnostic
accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrated that STAMP achieved competitive
diagnostic results on STAS-SXY, STAS-TXY and STAS-TCGA, with AUCs of 0.8058,
0.8017, and 0.7928, respectively, surpassing the clinical level.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于文本引导的图像编辑方法过度依赖目标提示，导致源图像语义保留不足且编辑路径冗长。

Method: TweezeEdit通过梯度驱动正则化，在一致性模型指导下直接注入目标提示语义，避免依赖反转锚点。

Result: 实验表明，TweezeEdit在语义保留和目标对齐上优于现有方法，仅需12步（1.6秒/次）。

Conclusion: TweezeEdit为实时图像编辑提供了高效且一致的解决方案。

Abstract: Large-scale pre-trained diffusion models empower users to edit images through
text guidance. However, existing methods often over-align with target prompts
while inadequately preserving source image semantics. Such approaches generate
target images explicitly or implicitly from the inversion noise of the source
images, termed the inversion anchors. We identify this strategy as suboptimal
for semantic preservation and inefficient due to elongated editing paths. We
propose TweezeEdit, a tuning- and inversion-free framework for consistent and
efficient image editing. Our method addresses these limitations by regularizing
the entire denoising path rather than relying solely on the inversion anchors,
ensuring source semantic retention and shortening editing paths. Guided by
gradient-driven regularization, we efficiently inject target prompt semantics
along a direct path using a consistency model. Extensive experiments
demonstrate TweezeEdit's superior performance in semantic preservation and
target alignment, outperforming existing methods. Remarkably, it requires only
12 steps (1.6 seconds per edit), underscoring its potential for real-time
applications.

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D Gaussian splatting have significantly improved
real-time novel view synthesis, yet insufficient geometric constraints during
scene optimization often result in blurred reconstructions of fine-grained
details, particularly in regions with high-frequency textures and sharp
discontinuities. To address this, we propose a comprehensive optimization
framework integrating multisample anti-aliasing (MSAA) with dual geometric
constraints. Our system computes pixel colors through adaptive blending of
quadruple subsamples, effectively reducing aliasing artifacts in high-frequency
components. The framework introduces two constraints: (a) an adaptive weighting
strategy that prioritizes under-reconstructed regions through dynamic gradient
analysis, and (b) gradient differential constraints enforcing geometric
regularization at object boundaries. This targeted optimization enables the
model to allocate computational resources preferentially to critical regions
requiring refinement while maintaining global consistency. Extensive
experimental evaluations across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance in detail preservation, particularly in
preserving high-frequency textures and sharp discontinuities, while maintaining

Motivation: 螺栓缺陷检测对输电线路安全至关重要，但缺陷图像稀缺和数据分布不均衡限制了检测效果。

Method: 1. 提出螺栓属性分割模型（Bolt-SAM），结合CLAHE-FFT适配器和多部分感知掩码解码器生成高质量掩码；2. 设计掩码优化模块（MOD）与图像修复模型（LaMa）结合，构建缺陷编辑模型（MOD-LaMa）；3. 提出编辑恢复增强策略（ERA）扩展数据集。

Abstract: Bolt defect detection is critical to ensure the safety of transmission lines.
However, the scarcity of defect images and imbalanced data distributions
significantly limit detection performance. To address this problem, we propose
a segmentationdriven bolt defect editing method (SBDE) to augment the dataset.
First, a bolt attribute segmentation model (Bolt-SAM) is proposed, which
enhances the segmentation of complex bolt attributes through the CLAHE-FFT
Adapter (CFA) and Multipart- Aware Mask Decoder (MAMD), generating high-quality
masks for subsequent editing tasks. Second, a mask optimization module (MOD) is
designed and integrated with the image inpainting model (LaMa) to construct the
bolt defect attribute editing model (MOD-LaMa), which converts normal bolts
into defective ones through attribute editing. Finally, an editing recovery
augmentation (ERA) strategy is proposed to recover and put the edited defect
bolts back into the original inspection scenes and expand the defect detection
dataset. We constructed multiple bolt datasets and conducted extensive
experiments. Experimental results demonstrate that the bolt defect images
generated by SBDE significantly outperform state-of-the-art image editing
models, and effectively improve the performance of bolt defect detection, which
fully verifies the effectiveness and application potential of the proposed
method. The code of the project is available at

Conclusion: 新方法在舞蹈动作预测中表现出色，解决了遮挡和音乐同步问题，具有理论和实践价值。

Abstract: Estimating human dance motion is a challenging task with various industrial
applications. Recently, many efforts have focused on predicting human dance
motion using either egocentric video or music as input. However, the task of
jointly estimating human motion from both egocentric video and music remains
largely unexplored. In this paper, we aim to develop a new method that predicts
human dance motion from both egocentric video and music. In practice, the
egocentric view often obscures much of the body, making accurate full-pose
estimation challenging. Additionally, incorporating music requires the
generated head and body movements to align well with both visual and musical
inputs. We first introduce EgoAIST++, a new large-scale dataset that combines
both egocentric views and music with more than 36 hours of dancing motion.
Drawing on the success of diffusion models and Mamba on modeling sequences, we
develop an EgoMusic Motion Network with a core Skeleton Mamba that explicitly
captures the skeleton structure of the human body. We illustrate that our
approach is theoretically supportive. Intensive experiments show that our
method clearly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches and generalizes
effectively to real-world data.

Motivation: 现有研究往往孤立地探讨不同类型的视觉推理，缺乏统一的分析和比较，因此需要一篇综述来填补这一空白。

Method: 论文将视觉推理分为五种类型，并通过图模型、记忆网络、注意力机制和神经符号系统等方法进行系统分析。

Conclusion: 未来研究方向包括复杂场景的可扩展性、符号与神经范式的深度融合、更全面的基准数据集以及弱监督下的推理，目标是构建透明、可信且跨领域自适应的AI系统。

Abstract: Visual reasoning is critical for a wide range of computer vision tasks that
go beyond surface-level object detection and classification. Despite notable
advances in relational, symbolic, temporal, causal, and commonsense reasoning,
existing surveys often address these directions in isolation, lacking a unified
analysis and comparison across reasoning types, methodologies, and evaluation
protocols. This survey aims to address this gap by categorizing visual
reasoning into five major types (relational, symbolic, temporal, causal, and
commonsense) and systematically examining their implementation through
architectures such as graph-based models, memory networks, attention
mechanisms, and neuro-symbolic systems. We review evaluation protocols designed
to assess functional correctness, structural consistency, and causal validity,
and critically analyze their limitations in terms of generalizability,
reproducibility, and explanatory power. Beyond evaluation, we identify key open
challenges in visual reasoning, including scalability to complex scenes, deeper
integration of symbolic and neural paradigms, the lack of comprehensive
benchmark datasets, and reasoning under weak supervision. Finally, we outline a
forward-looking research agenda for next-generation vision systems, emphasizing
that bridging perception and reasoning is essential for building transparent,
trustworthy, and cross-domain adaptive AI systems, particularly in critical
domains such as autonomous driving and medical diagnostics.

Conclusion: Med-GLIP-5M和Med-GLIP为医学图像定位及相关任务提供了强大的工具，未来将公开数据集。

Abstract: Medical image grounding aims to align natural language phrases with specific
regions in medical images, serving as a foundational task for intelligent
diagnosis, visual question answering (VQA), and automated report generation
(MRG). However, existing research is constrained by limited modality coverage,
coarse-grained annotations, and the absence of a unified, generalizable
grounding framework. To address these challenges, we construct a large-scale
medical grounding dataset Med-GLIP-5M comprising over 5.3 million region-level
annotations across seven imaging modalities, covering diverse anatomical
structures and pathological findings. The dataset supports both segmentation
and grounding tasks with hierarchical region labels, ranging from organ-level
boundaries to fine-grained lesions. Based on this foundation, we propose
Med-GLIP, a modality-aware grounding framework trained on Med-GLIP-5M. Rather
than relying on explicitly designed expert modules, Med-GLIP implicitly
acquires hierarchical semantic understanding from diverse training data --
enabling it to recognize multi-granularity structures, such as distinguishing
lungs from pneumonia lesions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Med-GLIP
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across multiple grounding
benchmarks. Furthermore, integrating its spatial outputs into downstream tasks,
including medical VQA and report generation, leads to substantial performance
gains. Our dataset will be released soon.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Mamba架构的图增强上下文与区域感知网络（GCRPNet），用于解决光学遥感图像中显著目标检测的挑战，通过多尺度特征提取和增强的局部建模能力，实现了最优性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 光学遥感图像中的显著目标检测面临目标尺度变化大和目标与背景对比度低的挑战，现有方法难以有效整合全局和局部特征。

Method: 采用视觉状态空间（VSS）编码器提取多尺度特征，设计了差异相似性引导的层次图注意力模块（DS-HGAM）和LEVSS解码器模块，结合自适应扫描策略和多粒度协作注意力增强模块（MCAEM）。

Result: 实验结果表明，GCRPNet在显著目标检测任务中达到了最优性能。

Conclusion: GCRPNet通过整合长距离依赖和增强区域特征表示，显著提升了显著目标检测的效果。

Abstract: Salient object detection (SOD) in optical remote sensing images (ORSIs) faces
numerous challenges, including significant variations in target scales and low
contrast between targets and the background. Existing methods based on vision
transformers (ViTs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) architectures aim
to leverage both global and local features, but the difficulty in effectively
integrating these heterogeneous features limits their overall performance. To
overcome these limitations, we propose a graph-enhanced contextual and regional
perception network (GCRPNet), which builds upon the Mamba architecture to
simultaneously capture long-range dependencies and enhance regional feature
representation. Specifically, we employ the visual state space (VSS) encoder to
extract multi-scale features. To further achieve deep guidance and enhancement
of these features, we first design a difference-similarity guided hierarchical
graph attention module (DS-HGAM). This module strengthens cross-layer
interaction capabilities between features of different scales while enhancing
the model's structural perception,allowing it to distinguish between foreground
and background more effectively. Then, we design the LEVSS block as the decoder
of GCRPNet. This module integrates our proposed adaptive scanning strategy and
multi-granularity collaborative attention enhancement module (MCAEM). It
performs adaptive patch scanning on feature maps processed via multi-scale
convolutions, thereby capturing rich local region information and enhancing
Mamba's local modeling capability. Extensive experimental results demonstrate
that the proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance, validating its
effectiveness and superiority.

Motivation: 减少对完全标注数据集的依赖，解决多数据集训练中的域偏移和部分类别标签缺失问题。

Method: 采用双流学习（确定性特征和概率性特征），结合文本引导的特征解耦与对齐，以及伪标签一致性和自蒸馏技术。

Conclusion: PSScreen通过创新的双流设计和特征对齐策略，有效提升了多视网膜疾病筛查的泛化能力和检测性能。

Abstract: Leveraging multiple partially labeled datasets to train a model for multiple
retinal disease screening reduces the reliance on fully annotated datasets, but
remains challenging due to significant domain shifts across training datasets
from various medical sites, and the label absent issue for partial classes. To
solve these challenges, we propose PSScreen, a novel Partially Supervised
multiple retinal disease Screening model. Our PSScreen consists of two streams
and one learns deterministic features and the other learns probabilistic
features via uncertainty injection. Then, we leverage the textual guidance to
decouple two types of features into disease-wise features and align them via
feature distillation to boost the domain generalization ability. Meanwhile, we
employ pseudo label consistency between two streams to address the label absent
issue and introduce a self-distillation to transfer task-relevant semantics
about known classes from the deterministic to the probabilistic stream to
further enhance the detection performances. Experiments show that our PSScreen
significantly enhances the detection performances on six retinal diseases and
the normal state averagely and achieves state-of-the-art results on both
in-domain and out-of-domain datasets. Codes are available at

Conclusion: AR实时工具跟踪在手术导航中具有显著优势，未来可进一步优化和应用。

Abstract: Augmented Reality (AR) surgical navigation systems are emerging as the next
generation of intraoperative surgical guidance, promising to overcome
limitations of traditional navigation systems. However, known issues with AR
depth perception due to vergence-accommodation conflict and occlusion handling
limitations of the currently commercially available display technology present
acute challenges in surgical settings where precision is paramount. This study
presents a novel methodology for utilizing AR guidance to register anatomical
targets and provide real-time instrument navigation using placement of
simulated external ventricular drain catheters on a phantom model as the
clinical scenario. The system registers target positions to the patient through
a novel surface tracing method and uses real-time infrared tool tracking to aid
in catheter placement, relying only on the onboard sensors of the Microsoft
HoloLens 2. A group of intended users performed the procedure of simulated
insertions under two AR guidance conditions: static in-situ visualization,
where planned trajectories are overlaid directly onto the patient anatomy, and
real-time tool-tracking guidance, where live feedback of the catheter's pose is
provided relative to the plan. Following the insertion tests, computed
tomography scans of the phantom models were acquired, allowing for evaluation
of insertion accuracy, target deviation, angular error, and depth precision.
System Usability Scale surveys assessed user experience and cognitive workload.
Tool-tracking guidance improved performance metrics across all accuracy
measures and was preferred by users in subjective evaluations. A free copy of

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为RAP的新型OOD检测方法，通过检索外部知识增强预训练视觉语言模型的提示，显著提升了OOD检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有OOD检测方法因依赖有限且不匹配的异常样本，导致语义监督不足，性能不佳。

Method: RAP通过检索外部知识动态增强模型提示，训练时基于联合相似性检索描述性词汇，测试时实时更新提示以适应环境。

Result: 在ImageNet-1k数据集的1-shot OOD检测中，RAP将FPR95降低7.05%，AUROC提升1.71%。

Conclusion: RAP通过动态知识检索与提示增强，显著提升了OOD检测性能，验证了其模块的有效性和设计动机。

Abstract: Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection is crucial for the reliable deployment of
machine learning models in-the-wild, enabling accurate identification of test
samples that differ from the training data distribution. Existing methods rely
on auxiliary outlier samples or in-distribution (ID) data to generate outlier
information for training, but due to limited outliers and their mismatch with
real test OOD samples, they often fail to provide sufficient semantic
supervision, leading to suboptimal performance. To address this, we propose a
novel OOD detection method called Retrieval-Augmented Prompt (RAP). RAP
augments a pre-trained vision-language model's prompts by retrieving external
knowledge, offering enhanced semantic supervision for OOD detection. During
training, RAP retrieves descriptive words for outliers based on joint
similarity with external textual knowledge and uses them to augment the model's
OOD prompts. During testing, RAP dynamically updates OOD prompts in real-time
based on the encountered OOD samples, enabling the model to rapidly adapt to
the test environment. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that RAP achieves
state-of-the-art performance on large-scale OOD detection benchmarks. For
example, in 1-shot OOD detection on the ImageNet-1k dataset, RAP reduces the
average FPR95 by 7.05% and improves the AUROC by 1.71% compared to previous
methods. Additionally, comprehensive ablation studies validate the
effectiveness of each module and the underlying motivations of our approach.

TL;DR: PTQAT是一种混合量化方法，结合PTQ和QAT的优点，通过选择性微调关键层提高量化模型性能，同时减少计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决PTQ性能下降和QAT计算资源消耗大的问题，提出一种高效且通用的量化方法。

Method: 选择输出差异小的层进行QAT微调，其余层采用PTQ，以减少量化误差传播。

Result: 在多种3D感知任务中表现优于纯QAT，量化精度提升且计算资源需求降低。

Conclusion: PTQAT是一种高效通用的量化方法，适用于多种模型架构和任务。

Abstract: Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) and Quantization-Aware Training (QAT)
represent two mainstream model quantization approaches. However, PTQ often
leads to unacceptable performance degradation in quantized models, while QAT
imposes substantial GPU memory requirements and extended training time due to
weight fine-tuning.In this paper, we propose PTQAT, a novel general hybrid
quantization algorithm for the efficient deployment of 3D perception networks.
To address the speed accuracy trade-off between PTQ and QAT, our method selects
critical layers for QAT fine-tuning and performs PTQ on the remaining layers.
Contrary to intuition, fine-tuning the layers with smaller output discrepancies
before and after quantization, rather than those with larger discrepancies,
actually leads to greater improvements in the model's quantization accuracy.
This means we better compensate for quantization errors during their
propagation, rather than addressing them at the point where they occur. The
proposed PTQAT achieves similar performance to QAT with more efficiency by
freezing nearly 50% of quantifiable layers. Additionally, PTQAT is a universal
quantization method that supports various quantization bit widths (4 bits) as
well as different model architectures, including CNNs and Transformers. The
experimental results on nuScenes across diverse 3D perception tasks, including
object detection, semantic segmentation, and occupancy prediction, show that
our method consistently outperforms QAT-only baselines. Notably, it achieves
0.2%-0.9% NDS and 0.3%-1.0% mAP gains in object detection, 0.3%-2.0% mIoU gains
in semantic segmentation and occupancy prediction while fine-tuning fewer
weights.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前音频驱动的说话头部视频生成方法因依赖隐式建模而常出现运动模糊和唇部抖动，缺乏显式发音先验（如面部肌肉运动的解剖学指导）。

Method: HM-Talker通过混合运动表示（结合隐式和显式特征）和跨模态解缠模块（CMDM）提取互补特征，并引入混合运动建模模块（HMMM）增强跨主体泛化能力。

Result: 实验表明HM-Talker在视觉质量和唇同步准确性上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: HM-Talker通过混合运动表示和身份无关学习，显著提升了说话头部视频的生成质量。

Abstract: Audio-driven talking head video generation enhances user engagement in
human-computer interaction. However, current methods frequently produce videos
with motion blur and lip jitter, primarily due to their reliance on implicit
modeling of audio-facial motion correlations--an approach lacking explicit
articulatory priors (i.e., anatomical guidance for speech-related facial
movements). To overcome this limitation, we propose HM-Talker, a novel
framework for generating high-fidelity, temporally coherent talking heads.
HM-Talker leverages a hybrid motion representation combining both implicit and
explicit motion cues. Explicit cues use Action Units (AUs), anatomically
defined facial muscle movements, alongside implicit features to minimize
phoneme-viseme misalignment. Specifically, our Cross-Modal Disentanglement
Module (CMDM) extracts complementary implicit/explicit motion features while
predicting AUs directly from audio input aligned to visual cues. To mitigate
identity-dependent biases in explicit features and enhance cross-subject
generalization, we introduce the Hybrid Motion Modeling Module (HMMM). This
module dynamically merges randomly paired implicit/explicit features, enforcing
identity-agnostic learning. Together, these components enable robust lip
synchronization across diverse identities, advancing personalized talking head
synthesis. Extensive experiments demonstrate HM-Talker's superiority over
state-of-the-art methods in visual quality and lip-sync accuracy.

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving systems promise stronger performance through
unified optimization of perception, motion forecasting, and planning. However,
vision-based approaches face fundamental limitations in adverse weather
conditions, partial occlusions, and precise velocity estimation - critical
challenges in safety-sensitive scenarios where accurate motion understanding
and long-horizon trajectory prediction are essential for collision avoidance.
To address these limitations, we propose SpaRC-AD, a query-based end-to-end
camera-radar fusion framework for planning-oriented autonomous driving. Through
sparse 3D feature alignment, and doppler-based velocity estimation, we achieve
strong 3D scene representations for refinement of agent anchors, map polylines
and motion modelling. Our method achieves strong improvements over the
state-of-the-art vision-only baselines across multiple autonomous driving
tasks, including 3D detection (+4.8% mAP), multi-object tracking (+8.3% AMOTA),
online mapping (+1.8% mAP), motion prediction (-4.0% mADE), and trajectory
planning (-0.1m L2 and -9% TPC). We achieve both spatial coherence and temporal
consistency on multiple challenging benchmarks, including real-world open-loop
nuScenes, long-horizon T-nuScenes, and closed-loop simulator Bench2Drive. We
show the effectiveness of radar-based fusion in safety-critical scenarios where
accurate motion understanding and long-horizon trajectory prediction are
essential for collision avoidance. The source code of all experiments is

Conclusion: 提出的多模态代理方法在灵活性和性能上均优于传统和现有方法。

Abstract: Referring-based Video Object Segmentation is a multimodal problem that
requires producing fine-grained segmentation results guided by external cues.
Traditional approaches to this task typically involve training specialized
models, which come with high computational complexity and manual annotation
effort. Recent advances in vision-language foundation models open a promising
direction toward training-free approaches. Several studies have explored
leveraging these general-purpose models for fine-grained segmentation,
achieving performance comparable to that of fully supervised, task-specific
models. However, existing methods rely on fixed pipelines that lack the
flexibility needed to adapt to the dynamic nature of the task. To address this
limitation, we propose Multi-Modal Agent, a novel agentic system designed to
solve this task in a more flexible and adaptive manner. Specifically, our
method leverages the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to
generate dynamic workflows tailored to each input. This adaptive procedure
iteratively interacts with a set of specialized tools designed for low-level
tasks across different modalities to identify the target object described by
the multimodal cues. Our agentic approach demonstrates clear improvements over
prior methods on two multimodal-conditioned VOS tasks: RVOS and Ref-AVS.

fine-grained evaluation frameworks for human-centered scenarios, encompassing
both the understanding of complex human intentions and the provision of
empathetic, context-aware responses. Here we introduce HumanSense, a
comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the human-centered perception and
interaction capabilities of MLLMs, with a particular focus on deep
understanding of extended multimodal contexts and the formulation of rational
feedback. Our evaluation reveals that leading MLLMs still have considerable
room for improvement, particularly for advanced interaction-oriented tasks.
Supplementing visual input with audio and text information yields substantial
improvements, and Omni-modal models show advantages on these tasks.
Furthermore, we argue that appropriate feedback stems from a contextual
analysis of the interlocutor's needs and emotions, with reasoning ability
serving as the key to unlocking it. Accordingly, we employ a multi-stage,
modality-progressive reinforcement learning to enhance the reasoning abilities
of an Omni model, achieving substantial gains on evaluation results.
Additionally, we observe that successful reasoning processes exhibit highly
consistent thought patterns. By designing corresponding prompts, we also
enhance the performance of non-reasoning models in a training-free manner.

TL;DR: EvTurb提出了一种基于事件流的湍流去除框架，通过两步事件引导网络分离模糊和倾斜效应，并在真实数据集上验证了其优越性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大气湍流导致图像模糊和几何倾斜，严重影响计算机视觉任务，现有方法难以解决这一高度不适定问题。

Method: EvTurb利用高速事件流建模湍流效应，通过事件积分减少模糊，再通过方差图消除倾斜。

Result: 实验表明EvTurb在性能上超越现有方法，同时保持计算效率。

Conclusion: EvTurb为湍流去除提供了高效解决方案，并首次公开真实湍流数据集TurbEvent。

Abstract: Atmospheric turbulence degrades image quality by introducing blur and
geometric tilt distortions, posing significant challenges to downstream
computer vision tasks. Existing single-image and multi-frame methods struggle
with the highly ill-posed nature of this problem due to the compositional
complexity of turbulence-induced distortions. To address this, we propose
EvTurb, an event guided turbulence removal framework that leverages high-speed
event streams to decouple blur and tilt effects. EvTurb decouples blur and tilt
effects by modeling event-based turbulence formation, specifically through a
novel two-step event-guided network: event integrals are first employed to
reduce blur in the coarse outputs. This is followed by employing a variance
map, derived from raw event streams, to eliminate the tilt distortion for the
refined outputs. Additionally, we present TurbEvent, the first real-captured
dataset featuring diverse turbulence scenarios. Experimental results
demonstrate that EvTurb surpasses state-of-the-art methods while maintaining
computational efficiency.

TL;DR: 论文提出P$^3$A框架，针对自动驾驶中的2D目标检测，优化高分辨率数据集的对抗性补丁攻击，引入新评价指标PASR和损失函数LCSL，提升攻击效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有黑盒攻击方法在自动驾驶场景中因评价指标和低分辨率数据限制，攻击效果被高估，实际成功率低。

Method: 提出PASR评价指标、LCSL损失函数和PSPP数据预处理方法，优化高分辨率数据集的攻击效果。

Result: P$^3$A在未见模型和高分辨率数据集上优于现有攻击方法。

Conclusion: P$^3$A框架显著提升对抗性补丁攻击的实用性和效果。

Abstract: Learning-based autonomous driving systems remain critically vulnerable to
adversarial patches, posing serious safety and security risks in their
real-world deployment. Black-box attacks, notable for their high attack success
rate without model knowledge, are especially concerning, with their
transferability extensively studied to reduce computational costs compared to
query-based attacks. Previous transferability-based black-box attacks typically
adopt mean Average Precision (mAP) as the evaluation metric and design training
loss accordingly. However, due to the presence of multiple detected bounding
boxes and the relatively lenient Intersection over Union (IoU) thresholds, the
attack effectiveness of these approaches is often overestimated, resulting in
reduced success rates in practical attacking scenarios. Furthermore, patches
trained on low-resolution data often fail to maintain effectiveness on
high-resolution images, limiting their transferability to autonomous driving
datasets. To fill this gap, we propose P$^3$A, a Powerful and Practical Patch
Attack framework for 2D object detection in autonomous driving, specifically
optimized for high-resolution datasets. First, we introduce a novel metric,
Practical Attack Success Rate (PASR), to more accurately quantify attack
effectiveness with greater relevance for pedestrian safety. Second, we present
a tailored Localization-Confidence Suppression Loss (LCSL) to improve attack
transferability under PASR. Finally, to maintain the transferability for
high-resolution datasets, we further incorporate the Probabilistic
Scale-Preserving Padding (PSPP) into the patch attack pipeline as a data
preprocessing step. Extensive experiments show that P$^3$A outperforms
state-of-the-art attacks on unseen models and unseen high-resolution datasets,
both under the proposed practical IoU-based evaluation metric and the previous
mAP-based metrics.

*Daejune Choi,Youchan No,Jinhyung Lee,Duksu Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种轻量级的上采样模块FGA，用于单图像超分辨率，通过傅里叶特征和注意力机制提升高频细节重建能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统上采样方法（如子像素卷积）效率高但难以重建高频细节并易引入混叠伪影，FGA旨在解决这些问题。

Method: FGA结合了傅里叶特征MLP进行位置频率编码、跨分辨率相关注意力层实现自适应空间对齐，以及频域L1损失监督频谱保真度。

Result: FGA仅增加0.3M参数，在五种超分辨率骨干网络中均表现优异，PSNR平均提升0.12~0.14 dB，频域一致性提升29%。

Conclusion: FGA在减少混叠和保留细节方面效果显著，是一种实用且可扩展的上采样方法替代方案。

Abstract: We propose Frequency-Guided Attention (FGA), a lightweight upsampling module
for single image super-resolution. Conventional upsamplers, such as Sub-Pixel
Convolution, are efficient but frequently fail to reconstruct high-frequency
details and introduce aliasing artifacts. FGA addresses these issues by
integrating (1) a Fourier feature-based Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) for
positional frequency encoding, (2) a cross-resolution Correlation Attention
Layer for adaptive spatial alignment, and (3) a frequency-domain L1 loss for
spectral fidelity supervision. Adding merely 0.3M parameters, FGA consistently
enhances performance across five diverse super-resolution backbones in both
lightweight and full-capacity scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate
average PSNR gains of 0.12~0.14 dB and improved frequency-domain consistency by
up to 29%, particularly evident on texture-rich datasets. Visual and spectral
evaluations confirm FGA's effectiveness in reducing aliasing and preserving
fine details, establishing it as a practical, scalable alternative to
traditional upsampling methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FIND-Net是一种新型金属伪影减少（MAR）框架，结合频域和空间域处理，显著减少伪影并保留结构细节。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 金属植入物在CT成像中产生的高密度伪影严重影响图像质量，现有深度学习方法难以同时抑制伪影和保留结构细节。

Method: FIND-Net整合快速傅里叶卷积（FFC）层和可训练高斯滤波，将MAR任务视为频域和空间域的混合任务。

Result: 在合成数据集上，FIND-Net在MAE、SSIM和PSNR上均优于现有方法；在真实临床CT扫描中也表现优异。

Conclusion: FIND-Net在MAR任务中表现出色，具有更好的结构保留和临床适用性。

Abstract: Metal artifacts, caused by high-density metallic implants in computed
tomography (CT) imaging, severely degrade image quality, complicating diagnosis
and treatment planning. While existing deep learning algorithms have achieved
notable success in Metal Artifact Reduction (MAR), they often struggle to
suppress artifacts while preserving structural details. To address this
challenge, we propose FIND-Net (Fourier-Integrated Network with Dictionary
Kernels), a novel MAR framework that integrates frequency and spatial domain
processing to achieve superior artifact suppression and structural
preservation. FIND-Net incorporates Fast Fourier Convolution (FFC) layers and
trainable Gaussian filtering, treating MAR as a hybrid task operating in both
spatial and frequency domains. This approach enhances global contextual
understanding and frequency selectivity, effectively reducing artifacts while
maintaining anatomical structures. Experiments on synthetic datasets show that
FIND-Net achieves statistically significant improvements over state-of-the-art
MAR methods, with a 3.07% MAE reduction, 0.18% SSIM increase, and 0.90% PSNR
improvement, confirming robustness across varying artifact complexities.
Furthermore, evaluations on real-world clinical CT scans confirm FIND-Net's
ability to minimize modifications to clean anatomical regions while effectively
suppressing metal-induced distortions. These findings highlight FIND-Net's
potential for advancing MAR performance, offering superior structural
preservation and improved clinical applicability. Code is available at

TL;DR: Chamfer Guidance是一种无需训练的引导方法，通过少量真实样本提升生成图像的多样性和质量，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决生成模型在提升质量时牺牲多样性的问题，同时考虑合成与真实数据间的分布偏移。

Method: 利用少量真实样本（如2或32张）通过Chamfer Guidance优化生成过程，无需无条件模型。

Result: 在ImageNet-1k和多样性基准测试中，生成质量与多样性均显著提升，下游分类任务准确率提高15-16%。

Conclusion: Chamfer Guidance是一种高效且无需训练的方法，显著提升生成数据的实用性和多样性。

Abstract: Conditional image generative models hold considerable promise to produce
infinite amounts of synthetic training data. Yet, recent progress in generation
quality has come at the expense of generation diversity, limiting the utility
of these models as a source of synthetic training data. Although guidance-based
approaches have been introduced to improve the utility of generated data by
focusing on quality or diversity, the (implicit or explicit) utility functions
oftentimes disregard the potential distribution shift between synthetic and
real data. In this work, we introduce Chamfer Guidance: a training-free
guidance approach which leverages a handful of real exemplar images to
characterize the quality and diversity of synthetic data. We show that by
leveraging the proposed Chamfer Guidance, we can boost the diversity of the
generations w.r.t. a dataset of real images while maintaining or improving the
generation quality on ImageNet-1k and standard geo-diversity benchmarks. Our
approach achieves state-of-the-art few-shot performance with as little as 2
exemplar real images, obtaining 96.4\% in terms of precision, and 86.4\% in
terms of distributional coverage, which increase to 97.5\% and 92.7\%,
respectively, when using 32 real images. We showcase the benefits of the
Chamfer Guidance generation by training downstream image classifiers on
synthetic data, achieving accuracy boost of up to 15\% for in-distribution over
the baselines, and up to 16\% in out-of-distribution. Furthermore, our approach
does not require using the unconditional model, and thus obtains a 31\%
reduction in FLOPs w.r.t. classifier-free-guidance-based approaches at sampling
time.

TL;DR: ChatENV是一个交互式视觉语言模型，结合卫星图像和传感器数据，用于环境监测和场景推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型忽视环境传感器的因果信号，依赖单一来源的标注，缺乏交互式场景推理能力。

Method: 构建177k图像数据集，覆盖62个土地利用类别和197个国家，结合传感器数据；使用GPT-4o和Gemini 2.0标注数据；基于Qwen-2.5-VL微调LoRA适配器。

Result: 在时间推理和假设推理中表现优异（BERT-F1 0.903），优于现有时间模型。

Conclusion: ChatENV是一个强大的工具，支持基于传感器的环境监测和交互式分析。

Abstract: Understanding environmental changes from aerial imagery is vital for climate
resilience, urban planning, and ecosystem monitoring. Yet, current vision
language models (VLMs) overlook causal signals from environmental sensors, rely
on single-source captions prone to stylistic bias, and lack interactive
scenario-based reasoning. We present ChatENV, the first interactive VLM that
jointly reasons over satellite image pairs and real-world sensor data. Our
framework: (i) creates a 177k-image dataset forming 152k temporal pairs across
62 land-use classes in 197 countries with rich sensor metadata (e.g.,
temperature, PM10, CO); (ii) annotates data using GPT- 4o and Gemini 2.0 for
stylistic and semantic diversity; and (iii) fine-tunes Qwen-2.5-VL using
efficient Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) adapters for chat purposes. ChatENV
achieves strong performance in temporal and "what-if" reasoning (e.g., BERT-F1
0.903) and rivals or outperforms state-of-the-art temporal models, while
supporting interactive scenario-based analysis. This positions ChatENV as a
powerful tool for grounded, sensor-aware environmental monitoring.

Method: 分析图像采集过程中的参数和细微变换，研究它们如何被编码到视觉表示中。

Result: 发现这些参数会被编码到视觉表示中，且对语义预测有显著影响，具体效果取决于参数与语义标签的相关性。

Conclusion: 图像采集和细微变换的参数对视觉编码器的语义预测有重要影响，需在模型设计中加以考虑。

Abstract: Prior work has analyzed the robustness of visual encoders to image
transformations and corruptions, particularly in cases where such alterations
are not seen during training. When this occurs, they introduce a form of
distribution shift at test time, often leading to performance degradation. The
primary focus has been on severe corruptions that, when applied aggressively,
distort useful signals necessary for accurate semantic predictions.
  We take a different perspective by analyzing parameters of the image
acquisition process and transformations that may be subtle or even
imperceptible to the human eye. We find that such parameters are systematically
encoded in the learned visual representations and can be easily recovered. More
strikingly, their presence can have a profound impact, either positively or
negatively, on semantic predictions. This effect depends on whether there is a
strong correlation or anti-correlation between semantic labels and these
acquisition-based or processing-based labels. Our code and data are available

Motivation: 传统跛行检测依赖手工设计的特征，效率低且不灵活。本研究旨在通过自动学习运动特征，提高检测效率和准确性。

Method: 使用T-LEAP姿态估计模型提取奶牛行走视频中的关键点轨迹，输入BLSTM分类器进行二元跛行分类。

Result: 最佳架构分类准确率达85%，优于传统方法的80%，且仅需1秒视频数据即可检测。

Conclusion: 结合姿态估计和BLSTM的方法在跛行检测中表现优异，适用于小数据集和短序列。

Abstract: This study presents a lameness detection approach that combines pose
estimation and Bidirectional Long-Short-Term Memory (BLSTM) neural networks.
Combining pose-estimation and BLSTMs classifier offers the following
advantages: markerless pose-estimation, elimination of manual feature
engineering by learning temporal motion features from the keypoint
trajectories, and working with short sequences and small training datasets.
Motion sequences of nine keypoints (located on the cows' hooves, head and back)
were extracted from videos of walking cows with the T-LEAP pose estimation
model. The trajectories of the keypoints were then used as an input to a BLSTM
classifier that was trained to perform binary lameness classification. Our
method significantly outperformed an established method that relied on
manually-designed locomotion features: our best architecture achieved a
classification accuracy of 85%, against 80% accuracy for the feature-based
approach. Furthermore, we showed that our BLSTM classifier could detect
lameness with as little as one second of video data.

Conclusion: SemPT通过属性级知识增强和动态推理策略，显著提升视觉迁移学习的泛化能力。

Abstract: Visual transfer learning for unseen categories presents an active research
topic yet a challenging task, due to the inherent conflict between preserving
category-specific representations and acquiring transferable knowledge.
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) pre-trained on large amounts of image-text pairs
offer a promising solution. However, existing prompt tuning methods rely on
sparse category labels or disparate LLM-generated descriptions, which fragment
knowledge representation and hinder transferability. To address this
limitation, we introduce Semantic Prompt Tuning (SemPT), a novel framework that
tackles the generalization challenge by leveraging shared attribute-level
knowledge across categories. Specifically, SemPT adopts a two-step prompting
strategy to guide LLM in extracting shared visual attributes and generating
attribute-level descriptions, capturing transferable semantic cues beyond
labels while ensuring coherent structure. Then, visually guided weighting is
applied to the embeddings of attribute-level descriptions to reduce noise from
irrelevant attributes and enhance the text embeddings. Additionally, image
embeddings are jointly aligned with both label and attribute-enhanced text
embeddings, balancing discrimination for seen categories and transferability to
unseen ones. Considering the availability of category exposure, our inference
dynamically selects between standard label embeddings for seen categories and
attribute-enhanced embeddings for unseen ones to ensure effective adaptation.
Extensive experiments on 15 benchmark datasets demonstrate that SemPT achieves
state-of-the-art performance across various settings, including base-to-novel
generalization, cross-dataset transfer, cross-domain transfer, and few-shot
learning.

Motivation: 多模态数据在训练和测试中的不一致导致性能下降，需统一基准和优化整合方法。

Method: 引入UniBench300统一基准，采用串行任务整合方式，结合持续学习（CL）优化性能。

Result: 实验表明UniBench300显著提升性能，CL支持稳定整合，性能下降与网络容量负相关。

Conclusion: UniBench300和CL有效解决多模态任务整合问题，为未来研究提供重要参考。

Abstract: Unifying multiple multi-modal visual object tracking (MMVOT) tasks draws
increasing attention due to the complementary nature of different modalities in
building robust tracking systems. Existing practices mix all data sensor types
in a single training procedure, structuring a parallel paradigm from the
data-centric perspective and aiming for a global optimum on the joint
distribution of the involved tasks. However, the absence of a unified benchmark
where all types of data coexist forces evaluations on separated benchmarks,
causing \textit{inconsistency} between training and testing, thus leading to
performance \textit{degradation}. To address these issues, this work advances
in two aspects: \ding{182} A unified benchmark, coined as UniBench300, is
introduced to bridge the inconsistency by incorporating multiple task data,
reducing inference passes from three to one and cutting time consumption by
27\%. \ding{183} The unification process is reformulated in a serial format,
progressively integrating new tasks. In this way, the performance degradation
can be specified as knowledge forgetting of previous tasks, which naturally
aligns with the philosophy of continual learning (CL), motivating further
exploration of injecting CL into the unification process. Extensive experiments
conducted on two baselines and four benchmarks demonstrate the significance of
UniBench300 and the superiority of CL in supporting a stable unification
process. Moreover, while conducting dedicated analyses, the performance
degradation is found to be negatively correlated with network capacity.
Additionally, modality discrepancies contribute to varying degradation levels
across tasks (RGBT > RGBD > RGBE in MMVOT), offering valuable insights for
future multi-modal vision research. Source codes and the proposed benchmark is
available at \textit{https://github.com/Zhangyong-Tang/UniBench300}.

Method: 提出两阶段训练协议：跨视图对齐调整和地址定位调整，结合卫星图像和街景图像，并引入自动标签生成机制。

Result: AddressVLM在匹兹堡和旧金山数据集上的地址定位准确率分别比现有LVLM高出9%和12%。

Conclusion: AddressVLM通过跨视图对齐和两阶段训练显著提升了细粒度地址定位性能。

Abstract: Large visual language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance
in coarse-grained geo-localization at the country or city level, but they
struggle with fine-grained street-level localization within urban areas. In
this paper, we explore integrating city-wide address localization capabilities
into LVLMs, facilitating flexible address-related question answering using
street-view images. A key challenge is that the street-view visual
question-and-answer (VQA) data provides only microscopic visual cues, leading
to subpar performance in fine-tuned models. To tackle this issue, we
incorporate perspective-invariant satellite images as macro cues and propose
cross-view alignment tuning including a satellite-view and street-view image
grafting mechanism, along with an automatic label generation mechanism. Then
LVLM's global understanding of street distribution is enhanced through
cross-view matching. Our proposed model, named AddressVLM, consists of
two-stage training protocols: cross-view alignment tuning and address
localization tuning. Furthermore, we have constructed two street-view VQA
datasets based on image address localization datasets from Pittsburgh and San
Francisco. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate that AddressVLM
outperforms counterpart LVLMs by over 9% and 12% in average address
localization accuracy on these two datasets, respectively.

Conclusion: 混合真实与合成数据的策略有效构建了高质量数据集，显著提升了人脸识别模型的性能。

Abstract: In this paper, we present our approach to the DataCV ICCV Challenge, which
centers on building a high-quality face dataset to train a face recognition
model. The constructed dataset must not contain identities overlapping with any
existing public face datasets. To handle this challenge, we begin with a
thorough cleaning of the baseline HSFace dataset, identifying and removing
mislabeled or inconsistent identities through a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)
strategy combining face embedding clustering and GPT-4o-assisted verification.
We retain the largest consistent identity cluster and apply data augmentation
up to a fixed number of images per identity. To further diversify the dataset,
we generate synthetic identities using Stable Diffusion with prompt
engineering. As diffusion models are computationally intensive, we generate
only one reference image per identity and efficiently expand it using Vec2Face,
which rapidly produces 49 identity-consistent variants. This hybrid approach
fuses GAN-based and diffusion-based samples, enabling efficient construction of
a diverse and high-quality dataset. To address the high visual similarity among
synthetic identities, we adopt a curriculum learning strategy by placing them
early in the training schedule, allowing the model to progress from easier to
harder samples. Our final dataset contains 50 images per identity, and all
newly generated identities are checked with mainstream face datasets to ensure
no identity leakage. Our method achieves \textbf{1st place} in the competition,
and experimental results show that our dataset improves model performance
across 10K, 20K, and 100K identity scales. Code is available at

Motivation: 现有方法仅建模低阶特征相关性且局限于单一时间尺度，而超图在高阶相关性学习中的潜力未被充分挖掘。

Method: HyperTea包含三个模块：GTEM（全局时间增强）、LTEM（局部时间增强）和TAM（时间对齐模块），整合了CNN、RNN和HGNN。

Result: 在DAUB和IRDST数据集上实现SOTA性能。

Conclusion: HyperTea首次将CNN、RNN和HGNN结合用于MIRSTD，显著提升了检测效果。

Abstract: In practical application scenarios, moving infrared small target detection
(MIRSTD) remains highly challenging due to the target's small size, weak
intensity, and complex motion pattern. Existing methods typically only model
low-order correlations between feature nodes and perform feature extraction and
enhancement within a single temporal scale. Although hypergraphs have been
widely used for high-order correlation learning, they have received limited
attention in MIRSTD. To explore the potential of hypergraphs and enhance
multi-timescale feature representation, we propose HyperTea, which integrates
global and local temporal perspectives to effectively model high-order
spatiotemporal correlations of features. HyperTea consists of three modules:
the global temporal enhancement module (GTEM) realizes global temporal context
enhancement through semantic aggregation and propagation; the local temporal
enhancement module (LTEM) is designed to capture local motion patterns between
adjacent frames and then enhance local temporal context; additionally, we
further develop a temporal alignment module (TAM) to address potential
cross-scale feature misalignment. To our best knowledge, HyperTea is the first
work to integrate convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural
networks (RNNs), and hypergraph neural networks (HGNNs) for MIRSTD,
significantly improving detection performance. Experiments on DAUB and IRDST
demonstrate its state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. Our source codes are

Conclusion: 该方法通过利用解剖冗余，有望减少每个TE所需的采集次数，提高效率。

Abstract: T2 mapping in fetal brain MRI has the potential to improve characterization
of the developing brain, especially at mid-field (0.55T), where T2 decay is
slower. However, this is challenging as fetal MRI acquisition relies on
multiple motion-corrupted stacks of thick slices, requiring slice-to-volume
reconstruction (SVR) to estimate a high-resolution (HR) 3D volume. Currently,
T2 mapping involves repeated acquisitions of these stacks at each echo time
(TE), leading to long scan times and high sensitivity to motion. We tackle this
challenge with a method that jointly reconstructs data across TEs, addressing
severe motion. Our approach combines implicit neural representations with a
physics-informed regularization that models T2 decay, enabling information
sharing across TEs while preserving anatomical and quantitative T2 fidelity. We
demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on simulated fetal brain and in vivo
adult datasets with fetal-like motion. We also present the first in vivo fetal
T2 mapping results at 0.55T. Our study shows potential for reducing the number
of stacks per TE in T2 mapping by leveraging anatomical redundancy.

Conclusion: IADGPT通过人类启发式训练策略，显著提升了工业异常检测的准确性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Few-Shot Industrial Anomaly Detection (FS-IAD) has important applications in
automating industrial quality inspection. Recently, some FS-IAD methods based
on Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have been proposed with some
achievements through prompt learning or fine-tuning. However, existing LVLMs
focus on general tasks but lack basic industrial knowledge and reasoning
capabilities related to FS-IAD, making these methods far from specialized human
quality inspectors. To address these challenges, we propose a unified
framework, IADGPT, designed to perform FS-IAD in a human-like manner, while
also handling associated localization and reasoning tasks, even for diverse and
novel industrial products. To this end, we introduce a three-stage progressive
training strategy inspired by humans. Specifically, the first two stages
gradually guide IADGPT in acquiring fundamental industrial knowledge and
discrepancy awareness. In the third stage, we design an in-context
learning-based training paradigm, enabling IADGPT to leverage a few-shot image
as the exemplars for improved generalization to novel products. In addition, we
design a strategy that enables IADGPT to output image-level and pixel-level
anomaly scores using the logits output and the attention map, respectively, in
conjunction with the language output to accomplish anomaly reasoning. To
support our training, we present a new dataset comprising 100K images across
400 diverse industrial product categories with extensive attribute-level
textual annotations. Experiments indicate IADGPT achieves considerable
performance gains in anomaly detection and demonstrates competitiveness in
anomaly localization and reasoning. We will release our dataset in
camera-ready.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法需微调大型扩散模型或从头训练，成本高且重建模糊、泛化能力差，因此探索轻量级框架以直接利用预训练模型的能力。

Method: 使用相机姿态条件化的U-Net（TUNet）预测目标视图的潜在表示，提出融合策略利用DDIM反演中的噪声相关性保留细节，最终通过DDIM采样生成新视图。

Result: 在MVImgNet上的实验表明，该方法优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 提出的轻量级框架能高效合成高质量新视图，解决了现有方法的成本高和细节丢失问题。

Abstract: Synthesizing novel views from a single input image is a challenging task. It
requires extrapolating the 3D structure of a scene while inferring details in
occluded regions, and maintaining geometric consistency across viewpoints. Many
existing methods must fine-tune large diffusion backbones using multiple views
or train a diffusion model from scratch, which is extremely expensive.
Additionally, they suffer from blurry reconstruction and poor generalization.
This gap presents the opportunity to explore an explicit lightweight view
translation framework that can directly utilize the high-fidelity generative
capabilities of a pretrained diffusion model while reconstructing a scene from
a novel view. Given the DDIM-inverted latent of a single input image, we employ
a camera pose-conditioned translation U-Net, TUNet, to predict the inverted
latent corresponding to the desired target view. However, the image sampled
using the predicted latent may result in a blurry reconstruction. To this end,
we propose a novel fusion strategy that exploits the inherent noise correlation
structure observed in DDIM inversion. The proposed fusion strategy helps
preserve the texture and fine-grained details. To synthesize the novel view, we
use the fused latent as the initial condition for DDIM sampling, leveraging the
generative prior of the pretrained diffusion model. Extensive experiments on
MVImgNet demonstrate that our method outperforms existing methods.

*Zhanwen Liu,Yujing Sun,Yang Wang,Nan Yang,Shengbo Eben Li,Xiangmo Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合事件相机和RGB相机的运动线索融合网络（MCFNet），用于解决复杂交通环境中动态范围限制导致的特征提取问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RGB相机在复杂交通环境（如夜间驾驶、隧道）中动态范围有限，导致全局对比度降低和高频细节丢失，影响目标检测性能。

Method: 通过事件校正模块（ECM）和时间动态上采样模块（EDUM）实现时空对齐，并利用交叉模态融合模块（CMM）进行自适应特征融合。

Result: 在DSEC-Det和PKU-DAVIS-SOD数据集上，MCFNet显著优于现有方法，mAP50提升7.4%，mAP提升1.7%。

Conclusion: MCFNet通过结合事件相机和RGB相机，有效提升了复杂光照条件下的目标检测性能。

Abstract: The dynamic range limitation of conventional RGB cameras reduces global
contrast and causes loss of high-frequency details such as textures and edges
in complex traffic environments (e.g., nighttime driving, tunnels), hindering
discriminative feature extraction and degrading frame-based object detection.
To address this, we integrate a bio-inspired event camera with an RGB camera to
provide high dynamic range information and propose a motion cue fusion network
(MCFNet), which achieves optimal spatiotemporal alignment and adaptive
cross-modal feature fusion under challenging lighting. Specifically, an event
correction module (ECM) temporally aligns asynchronous event streams with image
frames via optical-flow-based warping, jointly optimized with the detection
network to learn task-aware event representations. The event dynamic upsampling
module (EDUM) enhances spatial resolution of event frames to match image
structures, ensuring precise spatiotemporal alignment. The cross-modal mamba
fusion module (CMM) uses adaptive feature fusion with a novel interlaced
scanning mechanism, effectively integrating complementary information for
robust detection. Experiments conducted on the DSEC-Det and PKU-DAVIS-SOD
datasets demonstrate that MCFNet significantly outperforms existing methods in
various poor lighting and fast moving traffic scenarios. Notably, on the
DSEC-Det dataset, MCFNet achieves a remarkable improvement, surpassing the best
existing methods by 7.4% in mAP50 and 1.7% in mAP metrics, respectively. The
code is available at https://github.com/Charm11492/MCFNet.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散模型在生成图像时难以准确反映输入提示中的对象数量，且现有方法依赖外部模块或忽略早期去噪步骤的关键作用。

Method: 提出CountCluster方法，通过聚类对象交叉注意力图并优化潜在分布，无需外部工具或额外训练。

Result: 方法在对象计数准确率上平均提升18.5%，并在多种提示下表现优异。

Conclusion: CountCluster通过优化早期去噪步骤的注意力图，显著提升了对象数量控制的性能。

Abstract: Diffusion-based text-to-image generation models have demonstrated strong
performance in terms of image quality and diversity. However, they still
struggle to generate images that accurately reflect the number of objects
specified in the input prompt. Several approaches have been proposed that rely
on either external counting modules for iterative refinement or quantity
representations derived from learned tokens or latent features. However, they
still have limitations in accurately reflecting the specified number of objects
and overlook an important structural characteristic--The number of object
instances in the generated image is largely determined in the early timesteps
of the denoising process. To correctly reflect the object quantity for image
generation, the highly activated regions in the object cross-attention map at
the early timesteps should match the input object quantity, while each region
should be clearly separated. To address this issue, we propose
\textit{CountCluster}, a method that guides the object cross-attention map to
be clustered according to the specified object count in the input, without
relying on any external tools or additional training. The proposed method
partitions the object cross-attention map into $k$ clusters at inference time
based on attention scores, defines an ideal distribution in which each cluster
is spatially well-separated, and optimizes the latent to align with this target
distribution. Our method achieves an average improvement of 18.5\%p in object
count accuracy compared to existing methods, and demonstrates superior quantity
control performance across a variety of prompts. Code will be released at:

Conclusion: 神经网络方法为卫星上的实时SAR数据处理提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data enables large-scale surveillance of
maritime vessels. However, near-real-time monitoring is currently constrained
by the need to downlink all raw data, perform image focusing, and subsequently
analyze it on the ground. On-board processing to generate higher-level products
could reduce the data volume that needs to be downlinked, alleviating bandwidth
constraints and minimizing latency. However, traditional image focusing and
processing algorithms face challenges due to the satellite's limited memory,
processing power, and computational resources. This work proposes and evaluates
neural networks designed for real-time inference on unfocused SAR data acquired
in Stripmap and Interferometric Wide (IW) modes captured with Sentinel-1. Our
results demonstrate the feasibility of using one of our models for on-board
processing and deployment on an FPGA. Additionally, by investigating a binary
classification task between ships and windmills, we demonstrate that target
classification is possible.

Conclusion: 该框架为跨视角定位和匹配提供了更优的解决方案，并推出了首个带有像素级对应标注的基准数据集CVFM。

Abstract: Cross-view localization aims to estimate the 3 degrees of freedom pose of a
ground-view image by registering it to aerial or satellite imagery. It is
essential in GNSS-denied environments such as urban canyons and disaster zones.
Existing methods either regress poses directly or align features in a shared
bird's-eye view (BEV) space, both built upon accurate spatial correspondences
between perspectives. However, these methods fail to establish strict
cross-view correspondences, yielding only coarse or geometrically inconsistent
matches. Consequently, fine-grained image matching between ground and aerial
views remains an unsolved problem, which in turn constrains the
interpretability of localization results. In this paper, we revisit cross-view
localization from the perspective of cross-view image matching and propose a
novel framework that improves both matching and localization. Specifically, we
introduce a Surface Model to model visible regions for accurate BEV projection,
and a SimRefiner module to refine the similarity matrix through local-global
residual correction, eliminating the reliance on post-processing like RANSAC.
To further support research in this area, we introduce CVFM, the first
benchmark with 32,509 cross-view image pairs annotated with pixel-level
correspondences. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach
substantially improves both localization accuracy and image matching quality,
setting new baselines under extreme viewpoint disparity.

Result: DCPE在LlamaGen-B上加速训练42%，并提升FID和IS性能。

Conclusion: DCPE是一种即插即用的方法，能有效挖掘和利用代码本中的令牌相似性信息，提升自回归模型的训练效率和性能。

Abstract: Advanced discrete token-based autoregressive image generation systems first
tokenize images into sequences of token indices with a codebook, and then model
these sequences in an autoregressive paradigm. While autoregressive generative
models are trained only on index values, the prior encoded in the codebook,
which contains rich token similarity information, is not exploited. Recent
studies have attempted to incorporate this prior by performing naive k-means
clustering on the tokens, helping to facilitate the training of generative
models with a reduced codebook. However, we reveal that k-means clustering
performs poorly in the codebook feature space due to inherent issues, including
token space disparity and centroid distance inaccuracy. In this work, we
propose the Discriminative Codebook Prior Extractor (DCPE) as an alternative to
k-means clustering for more effectively mining and utilizing the token
similarity information embedded in the codebook. DCPE replaces the commonly
used centroid-based distance, which is found to be unsuitable and inaccurate
for the token feature space, with a more reasonable instance-based distance.
Using an agglomerative merging technique, it further addresses the token space
disparity issue by avoiding splitting high-density regions and aggregating
low-density ones. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DCPE is plug-and-play
and integrates seamlessly with existing codebook prior-based paradigms. With
the discriminative prior extracted, DCPE accelerates the training of
autoregressive models by 42% on LlamaGen-B and improves final FID and IS
performance.

Method: 构建了EgoCross基准，涵盖四个多样化领域，包含约1,000个QA对，支持OpenQA和CloseQA格式。

Result: 实验显示现有模型在非日常生活领域泛化能力不足。

Conclusion: EgoCross为推进域自适应、鲁棒的自我中心视频理解提供了基础，并探索了改进方向。

Abstract: Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have
significantly pushed the frontier of egocentric video question answering
(EgocentricQA). However, existing benchmarks and studies are mainly limited to
common daily activities such as cooking and cleaning. In contrast, real-world
deployment inevitably encounters domain shifts, where target domains differ
substantially in both visual style and semantic content. To bridge this gap, we
introduce \textbf{EgoCross}, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the
cross-domain generalization of MLLMs in EgocentricQA. EgoCross covers four
diverse and challenging domains, including surgery, industry, extreme sports,
and animal perspective, representing realistic and high-impact application
scenarios. It comprises approximately 1,000 QA pairs across 798 video clips,
spanning four key QA tasks: prediction, recognition, localization, and
counting. Each QA pair provides both OpenQA and CloseQA formats to support
fine-grained evaluation. Extensive experiments show that most existing MLLMs,
whether general-purpose or egocentric-specialized, struggle to generalize to
domains beyond daily life, highlighting the limitations of current models.
Furthermore, we conduct several pilot studies, \eg, fine-tuning and
reinforcement learning, to explore potential improvements. We hope EgoCross and
our accompanying analysis will serve as a foundation for advancing
domain-adaptive, robust egocentric video understanding. Data and codes will be

Abstract: Human perceptual systems excel at inducing and recognizing objects across
both known and novel categories, a capability far beyond current machine
learning frameworks. While generalized category discovery (GCD) aims to bridge
this gap, existing methods predominantly focus on optimizing objective
functions. We present an orthogonal solution, inspired by the human cognitive
process for novel object understanding: decomposing objects into visual
primitives and establishing cross-knowledge comparisons. We propose ConGCD,
which establishes primitive-oriented representations through high-level
semantic reconstruction, binding intra-class shared attributes via
deconstruction. Mirroring human preference diversity in visual processing,
where distinct individuals leverage dominant or contextual cues, we implement
dominant and contextual consensus units to capture class-discriminative
patterns and inherent distributional invariants, respectively. A consensus
scheduler dynamically optimizes activation pathways, with final predictions
emerging through multiplex consensus integration. Extensive evaluations across
coarse- and fine-grained benchmarks demonstrate ConGCD's effectiveness as a
consensus-aware paradigm. Code is available at github.com/lytang63/ConGCD.

Abstract: This paper presents a summary of the 2025 Sclera Segmentation Benchmarking
Competition (SSBC), which focused on the development of privacy-preserving
sclera-segmentation models trained using synthetically generated ocular images.
The goal of the competition was to evaluate how well models trained on
synthetic data perform in comparison to those trained on real-world datasets.
The competition featured two tracks: $(i)$ one relying solely on synthetic data
for model development, and $(ii)$ one combining/mixing synthetic with (a
limited amount of) real-world data. A total of nine research groups submitted
diverse segmentation models, employing a variety of architectural designs,
including transformer-based solutions, lightweight models, and segmentation
networks guided by generative frameworks. Experiments were conducted across
three evaluation datasets containing both synthetic and real-world images,
collected under diverse conditions. Results show that models trained entirely
on synthetic data can achieve competitive performance, particularly when
dedicated training strategies are employed, as evidenced by the top performing
models that achieved $F_1$ scores of over $0.8$ in the synthetic data track.
Moreover, performance gains in the mixed track were often driven more by
methodological choices rather than by the inclusion of real data, highlighting
the promise of synthetic data for privacy-aware biometric development. The code

Abstract: Symmetry is a fundamental concept that has been extensively studied, yet
detecting it in complex scenes remains a significant challenge in computer
vision. Recent heatmap-based approaches can localize potential regions of
symmetry axes but often lack precision in identifying individual axes. In this
work, we propose a novel framework for axis-level detection of the two most
common symmetry types-reflection and rotation-by representing them as explicit
geometric primitives, i.e. lines and points. Our method employs a dual-branch
architecture that is equivariant to the dihedral group, with each branch
specialized to exploit the structure of dihedral group-equivariant features for
its respective symmetry type. For reflection symmetry, we introduce
orientational anchors, aligned with group components, to enable
orientation-specific detection, and a reflectional matching that measures
similarity between patterns and their mirrored counterparts across candidate
axes. For rotational symmetry, we propose a rotational matching that compares
patterns at fixed angular intervals to identify rotational centers. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance,
outperforming existing approaches.

Abstract: The emergence of deepfake technology has introduced a range of societal
problems, garnering considerable attention. Current deepfake detection methods
perform well on specific datasets, but exhibit poor performance when applied to
datasets with unknown forgery techniques. Moreover, as the gap between emerging
and traditional forgery techniques continues to widen, cross-domain detection
methods that rely on common forgery traces are becoming increasingly
ineffective. This situation highlights the urgency of developing deepfake
detection technology with strong generalization to cope with fast iterative
forgery techniques. To address these challenges, we propose a Forgery Guided
Learning (FGL) strategy designed to enable detection networks to continuously
adapt to unknown forgery techniques. Specifically, the FGL strategy captures
the differential information between known and unknown forgery techniques,
allowing the model to dynamically adjust its learning process in real time. To
further improve the ability to perceive forgery traces, we design a Dual
Perception Network (DPNet) that captures both differences and relationships
among forgery traces. In the frequency stream, the network dynamically
perceives and extracts discriminative features across various forgery
techniques, establishing essential detection cues. These features are then
integrated with spatial features and projected into the embedding space. In
addition, graph convolution is employed to perceive relationships across the
entire feature space, facilitating a more comprehensive understanding of
forgery trace correlations. Extensive experiments show that our approach
generalizes well across different scenarios and effectively handles unknown
forgery challenges, providing robust support for deepfake detection. Our code

TL;DR: DARC是一种新型的模型驱动的群体配准框架，用于高效构建医学图像图谱，支持多种图像相似性度量，并解决了GPU内存问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数据驱动方法在群体配准中存在训练数据依赖、泛化性差和缺乏推理阶段的问题，而模型驱动方法虽数据高效但面临可扩展性和优化挑战。

Method: DARC采用坐标下降策略和中心性激活函数，实现无偏、微分同胚的图谱构建。

Result: DARC在一次性分割和形状合成中表现优异，超越现有少样本方法。

Conclusion: DARC为图谱构建及应用提供了灵活、通用且资源高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Atlas construction is fundamental to medical image analysis, offering a
standardized spatial reference for tasks such as population-level anatomical
modeling. While data-driven registration methods have recently shown promise in
pairwise settings, their reliance on large training datasets, limited
generalizability, and lack of true inference phases in groupwise contexts
hinder their practical use. In contrast, model-driven methods offer
training-free, theoretically grounded, and data-efficient alternatives, though
they often face scalability and optimization challenges when applied to large
3D datasets. In this work, we introduce DARC (Diffeomorphic Atlas Registration
via Coordinate descent), a novel model-driven groupwise registration framework
for atlas construction. DARC supports a broad range of image dissimilarity
metrics and efficiently handles arbitrary numbers of 3D images without
incurring GPU memory issues. Through a coordinate descent strategy and a
centrality-enforcing activation function, DARC produces unbiased, diffeomorphic
atlases with high anatomical fidelity. Beyond atlas construction, we
demonstrate two key applications: (1) One-shot segmentation, where labels
annotated only on the atlas are propagated to subjects via inverse
deformations, outperforming state-of-the-art few-shot methods; and (2) shape
synthesis, where new anatomical variants are generated by warping the atlas
mesh using synthesized diffeomorphic deformation fields. Overall, DARC offers a
flexible, generalizable, and resource-efficient framework for atlas
construction and applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文对主流视觉语言模型（VLMs）的空间物理推理能力进行了全面诊断分析，发现现有模型表现不佳，并提出了一种结合监督微调和规则强化学习的方法，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 空间物理推理是理解真实物理世界的基础能力，但现有视觉语言模型在此任务上的能力尚未充分探索。

Method: 采用监督微调结合规则强化学习的方法优化Qwen2.5-VL-7B模型。

Result: 优化后的模型在空间物理推理任务上表现显著提升，超越领先的专有模型。

Conclusion: 尽管取得进展，模型在新物理场景中的泛化能力仍有限，需进一步研究新方法。

Abstract: Spatio-physical reasoning, a foundation capability for understanding the real
physics world, is a critical step towards building robust world models. While
recent vision language models (VLMs) have shown remarkable progress in
specialized domains like multimodal mathematics and pure spatial understanding,
their capability for spatio-physical reasoning remains largely unexplored. This
paper provides a comprehensive diagnostic analysis of mainstream VLMs,
revealing that current models perform inadequately on this crucial task.
Further detailed analysis shows that this underperformance is largely
attributable to biases caused by human-like prior and a lack of deep reasoning.
To address these challenges, we apply supervised fine-tuning followed by
rule-based reinforcement learning to Qwen2.5-VL-7B, resulting in significant
improvements in spatio-physical reasoning capabilities and surpassing leading
proprietary models. Nevertheless, despite this success, the model's
generalization to new physics scenarios remains limited -- underscoring the
pressing need for new approaches in spatio-physical reasoning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AEGIS是一个针对超真实AI生成视频检测的大规模基准数据集，包含10,000多个真实和合成视频，旨在解决现有基准的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI生成内容的发展带来了高度真实的合成视频，对社会信任和数字完整性构成威胁，现有检测基准无法有效评估现代模型。

Method: AEGIS通过多样化生成模型（如Stable Video Diffusion等）构建数据集，并提供多模态注释（如语义真实性描述、运动特征等）。

Result: 实验表明，现有模型在AEGIS最具挑战性的子集上检测能力有限，凸显了数据集的复杂性和真实性。

Conclusion: AEGIS为开发更鲁棒的视频真实性检测方法提供了关键基准，推动了相关研究的发展。

Abstract: Recent advances in AI-generated content have fueled the rise of highly
realistic synthetic videos, posing severe risks to societal trust and digital
integrity. Existing benchmarks for video authenticity detection typically
suffer from limited realism, insufficient scale, and inadequate complexity,
failing to effectively evaluate modern vision-language models against
sophisticated forgeries. To address this critical gap, we introduce AEGIS, a
novel large-scale benchmark explicitly targeting the detection of
hyper-realistic and semantically nuanced AI-generated videos. AEGIS comprises
over 10,000 rigorously curated real and synthetic videos generated by diverse,
state-of-the-art generative models, including Stable Video Diffusion,
CogVideoX-5B, KLing, and Sora, encompassing open-source and proprietary
architectures. In particular, AEGIS features specially constructed challenging
subsets enhanced with robustness evaluation. Furthermore, we provide multimodal
annotations spanning Semantic-Authenticity Descriptions, Motion Features, and
Low-level Visual Features, facilitating authenticity detection and supporting
downstream tasks such as multimodal fusion and forgery localization. Extensive
experiments using advanced vision-language models demonstrate limited detection
capabilities on the most challenging subsets of AEGIS, highlighting the
dataset's unique complexity and realism beyond the current generalization
capabilities of existing models. In essence, AEGIS establishes an indispensable
evaluation benchmark, fundamentally advancing research toward developing
genuinely robust, reliable, broadly generalizable video authenticity detection
methodologies capable of addressing real-world forgery threats. Our dataset is

*Youping Gu,Xiaolong Li,Yuhao Hu,Bohan Zhuang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BLADE提出了一种数据无关的联合训练框架，结合自适应块稀疏注意力机制和稀疏感知的步蒸馏方法，显著加速视频生成模型推理，同时提升生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散变换器在高质量视频生成中表现优异，但其迭代去噪过程缓慢且长序列的二次注意力成本高，导致推理瓶颈。现有加速方法（步蒸馏和稀疏注意力）单独使用效果有限，联合训练又面临数据需求高的问题。

Method: BLADE框架包括：(1) 自适应块稀疏注意力机制（ASA），动态生成内容感知的稀疏掩码；(2) 基于轨迹分布匹配（TDM）的稀疏感知步蒸馏方法，将稀疏性直接融入蒸馏过程。

Result: 在CogVideoX-5B和Wan2.1-1.3B模型上，BLADE分别实现8.89x和14.10x的推理加速，并在VBench-2.0基准测试中提升生成质量分数。

Conclusion: BLADE通过联合训练框架有效解决了视频生成模型的推理瓶颈，同时提升速度和生成质量，为实际应用提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion transformers currently lead the field in high-quality video
generation, but their slow iterative denoising process and prohibitive
quadratic attention costs for long sequences create significant inference
bottlenecks. While both step distillation and sparse attention mechanisms have
shown promise as independent acceleration strategies, effectively combining
these approaches presents critical challenges -- training-free integration
yields suboptimal results, while separately training sparse attention after
step distillation requires prohibitively expensive high-quality video data. To
overcome these limitations, we propose BLADE, an innovative data-free joint
training framework that introduces: (1) an Adaptive Block-Sparse Attention
(ASA) mechanism for dynamically generating content-aware sparsity masks to
focus computation on salient spatiotemporal features, and (2) a sparsity-aware
step distillation paradigm built upon Trajectory Distribution Matching (TDM)
that directly incorporates sparsity into the distillation process rather than
treating it as a separate compression step, with fast convergence. We validate
BLADE on text-to-video models like CogVideoX-5B and Wan2.1-1.3B. Our framework
demonstrates remarkable efficiency gains across different scales. On
Wan2.1-1.3B, BLADE achieves a 14.10x end-to-end inference acceleration over a
50-step baseline. Moreover, on models such as CogVideoX-5B with short video
sequence lengths, our framework delivers a robust 8.89x speedup. Crucially, the
acceleration is accompanied by a consistent quality improvement. On the
VBench-2.0 benchmark, BLADE boosts the score of CogVideoX-5B to 0.569 (from
0.534) and Wan2.1-1.3B to 0.570 (from 0.563), results that are further
corroborated by superior ratings in human evaluations. Our code and model
weights are publicly available at: http://ziplab.co/BLADE-Homepage/.

TL;DR: 提出TriFlowSR框架，通过显式模式匹配解决LR与参考HR图像对齐问题，并引入首个UHD地标场景RefSR数据集Landmark-4K。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RefSR方法在信息对齐和数据集质量上存在不足，无法有效支持高质量恢复。

Method: 设计TriFlowSR框架，采用Reference Matching Strategy实现LR与参考HR图像的有效匹配。

Result: 实验表明，TriFlowSR能更好地利用参考HR图像的语义和纹理信息。

Conclusion: TriFlowSR是首个针对UHD地标场景的扩散基RefSR方法，解决了真实退化下的高质量恢复问题。

Abstract: Reference-based Image Super-Resolution (RefSR) aims to restore a
low-resolution (LR) image by utilizing the semantic and texture information
from an additional reference high-resolution (reference HR) image. Existing
diffusion-based RefSR methods are typically built upon ControlNet, which
struggles to effectively align the information between the LR image and the
reference HR image. Moreover, current RefSR datasets suffer from limited
resolution and poor image quality, resulting in the reference images lacking
sufficient fine-grained details to support high-quality restoration. To
overcome the limitations above, we propose TriFlowSR, a novel framework that
explicitly achieves pattern matching between the LR image and the reference HR
image. Meanwhile, we introduce Landmark-4K, the first RefSR dataset for
Ultra-High-Definition (UHD) landmark scenarios. Considering the UHD scenarios
with real-world degradation, in TriFlowSR, we design a Reference Matching
Strategy to effectively match the LR image with the reference HR image.
Experimental results show that our approach can better utilize the semantic and
texture information of the reference HR image compared to previous methods. To
the best of our knowledge, we propose the first diffusion-based RefSR pipeline
for ultra-high definition landmark scenarios under real-world degradation. Our
code and model will be available at https://github.com/nkicsl/TriFlowSR.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于用户交互的视频活体检测方法，通过控制面部接近摄像头的动作和光流分析，显著提高了对真实面部和攻击的区分能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有被动活体检测方法在区分真实面部与多种攻击（如照片、屏幕显示、面具和视频重放）时表现不足，需要更主动的方法。

Method: 设计了用户交互场景，要求参与者缓慢将面部靠近摄像头，结合光流分析和神经网络分类器处理时空特征。

Result: 该方法能更可靠地区分真实面部与攻击，显著优于被动方法。

Conclusion: 通过主动交互和光流分析，实现了更高效的视频活体检测。

Abstract: In this work, we proposed a novel cooperative video-based face liveness
detection method based on a new user interaction scenario where participants
are instructed to slowly move their frontal-oriented face closer to the camera.
This controlled approaching face protocol, combined with optical flow analysis,
represents the core innovation of our approach. By designing a system where
users follow this specific movement pattern, we enable robust extraction of
facial volume information through neural optical flow estimation, significantly
improving discrimination between genuine faces and various presentation attacks
(including printed photos, screen displays, masks, and video replays). Our
method processes both the predicted optical flows and RGB frames through a
neural classifier, effectively leveraging spatial-temporal features for more
reliable liveness detection compared to passive methods.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为VasoMIM的自监督学习框架，针对X射线血管造影图像中的血管分割问题，通过结合解剖学知识改进传统MIM方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于标注数据稀缺且传统MIM方法在血管分割中表现不佳，作者希望改进自监督学习方法以更好地捕捉血管解剖结构。

Method: VasoMIM包含两个关键组件：解剖学引导的掩蔽策略和解剖一致性损失，前者优先掩蔽血管区域，后者增强血管语义的一致性。

Result: VasoMIM在三个数据集上实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: VasoMIM展示了在X射线血管造影分析中的潜力，为血管分割提供了更有效的自监督学习方法。

Abstract: Accurate vessel segmentation in X-ray angiograms is crucial for numerous
clinical applications. However, the scarcity of annotated data presents a
significant challenge, which has driven the adoption of self-supervised
learning (SSL) methods such as masked image modeling (MIM) to leverage
large-scale unlabeled data for learning transferable representations.
Unfortunately, conventional MIM often fails to capture vascular anatomy because
of the severe class imbalance between vessel and background pixels, leading to
weak vascular representations. To address this, we introduce Vascular
anatomy-aware Masked Image Modeling (VasoMIM), a novel MIM framework tailored
for X-ray angiograms that explicitly integrates anatomical knowledge into the
pre-training process. Specifically, it comprises two complementary components:
anatomy-guided masking strategy and anatomical consistency loss. The former
preferentially masks vessel-containing patches to focus the model on
reconstructing vessel-relevant regions. The latter enforces consistency in
vascular semantics between the original and reconstructed images, thereby
improving the discriminability of vascular representations. Empirically,
VasoMIM achieves state-of-the-art performance across three datasets. These
findings highlight its potential to facilitate X-ray angiogram analysis.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散模型在遥感图像生成中保真度不足，影响目标检测模型的稳健性。

Method: 提取对象先验形状，引入双分支扩散模型和扩散一致性损失，并使用DDPO优化扩散过程。

Result: OF-Diff在多个关键指标上优于现有方法，特别是多态和小目标类别的性能显著提升（如飞机、船只和车辆的mAP分别提高8.3%、7.7%和4.0%）。

Conclusion: OF-Diff有效提升了遥感图像生成的保真度和多样性，为高精度目标检测提供了更可靠的数据支持。

Abstract: High-precision controllable remote sensing image generation is both
meaningful and challenging. Existing diffusion models often produce
low-fidelity images due to their inability to adequately capture morphological
details, which may affect the robustness and reliability of object detection
models. To enhance the accuracy and fidelity of generated objects in remote
sensing, this paper proposes Object Fidelity Diffusion (OF-Diff), which
effectively improves the fidelity of generated objects. Specifically, we are
the first to extract the prior shapes of objects based on the layout for
diffusion models in remote sensing. Then, we introduce a dual-branch diffusion
model with diffusion consistency loss, which can generate high-fidelity remote
sensing images without providing real images during the sampling phase.
Furthermore, we introduce DDPO to fine-tune the diffusion process, making the
generated remote sensing images more diverse and semantically consistent.
Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that OF-Diff outperforms state-of-the-art
methods in the remote sensing across key quality metrics. Notably, the
performance of several polymorphic and small object classes shows significant
improvement. For instance, the mAP increases by 8.3%, 7.7%, and 4.0% for
airplanes, ships, and vehicles, respectively.

Conclusion: UI-Venus为开源社区提供了SOTA模型、数据清理协议和自进化框架，推动UI代理领域的进一步发展。

Abstract: We present UI-Venus, a native UI agent that takes only screenshots as input
based on a multimodal large language model. UI-Venus achieves SOTA performance
on both UI grounding and navigation tasks using only several hundred thousand
high-quality training samples through reinforcement finetune (RFT) based on
Qwen2.5-VL. Specifically, the 7B and 72B variants of UI-Venus obtain 94.1% /
50.8% and 95.3% / 61.9% on the standard grounding benchmarks, i.e.,
Screenspot-V2 / Pro, surpassing the previous SOTA baselines including
open-source GTA1 and closed-source UI-TARS-1.5.To show UI-Venus's summary and
planing ability, we also evaluate it on the AndroidWorld, an online UI
navigation arena, on which our 7B and 72B variants achieve 49.1% and 65.9%
success rate, also beating existing models.To achieve this, we introduce
carefully designed reward functions for both UI grounding and navigation tasks
and corresponding efficient data cleaning strategies.To further boost
navigation performance, we propose Self-Evolving Trajectory History Alignment
\& Sparse Action Enhancement that refine historical reasoning traces and
balances the distribution of sparse but critical actions, leading to more
coherent planning and better generalization in complex UI tasks. Our
contributions include the publish of SOTA open-source UI agents, comprehensive

TL;DR: BaCon-Stereo提出了一种基于对比学习的自监督立体匹配框架，解决了遮挡区域的光度一致性假设失效问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前自监督立体匹配依赖光度一致性假设，但在遮挡区域因对应关系不明确而失效。

Method: 采用教师-学生范式，利用多基线输入，通过教师的预测监督学生，并引入遮挡感知注意力图。

Result: BaCon-Stereo在遮挡和非遮挡区域均表现优异，泛化能力强，在KITTI 2015和2012基准测试中超越现有方法。

Conclusion: BaCon-Stereo通过对比学习和多基线输入有效解决了遮挡问题，性能优越且泛化能力强。

Abstract: Current self-supervised stereo matching relies on the photometric consistency
assumption, which breaks down in occluded regions due to ill-posed
correspondences. To address this issue, we propose BaCon-Stereo, a simple yet
effective contrastive learning framework for self-supervised stereo network
training in both non-occluded and occluded regions. We adopt a teacher-student
paradigm with multi-baseline inputs, in which the stereo pairs fed into the
teacher and student share the same reference view but differ in target views.
Geometrically, regions occluded in the student's target view are often visible
in the teacher's, making it easier for the teacher to predict in these regions.
The teacher's prediction is rescaled to match the student's baseline and then
used to supervise the student. We also introduce an occlusion-aware attention
map to better guide the student in learning occlusion completion. To support
training, we synthesize a multi-baseline dataset BaCon-20k. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that BaCon-Stereo improves prediction in both occluded
and non-occluded regions, achieves strong generalization and robustness, and
outperforms state-of-the-art self-supervised methods on both KITTI 2015 and
2012 benchmarks. Our code and dataset will be released upon paper acceptance.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has proven essential for privacy-preserving,
collaborative training across distributed clients. Our prior work, TransFed,
introduced a robust transformer-based FL framework that leverages a
learn-to-adapt hypernetwork to generate personalized focal modulation layers
per client, outperforming traditional methods in non-IID and cross-domain
settings. In this extended version, we propose AdaptFED, where we deepen the
investigation of focal modulation in generalizable FL by incorporating: (1) a
refined adaptation strategy that integrates task-aware client embeddings to
personalize modulation dynamics further, (2) enhanced theoretical bounds on
adaptation performance, and (3) broader empirical validation across additional
modalities, including time-series and multilingual data. We also introduce an
efficient variant of TransFed that reduces server-client communication overhead
via low-rank hypernetwork conditioning, enabling scalable deployment in
resource-constrained environments. Extensive experiments on eight diverse
datasets reaffirm the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art
baselines, particularly in source-free and cross-task federated setups. Our
findings not only extend the capabilities of focal modulation in FL but also
pave the way for more adaptive, scalable, and generalizable transformer-based
federated systems. The code is available at

Result: 实验表明，PhysHPO显著提升了视频生成的物理合理性和整体质量。

Conclusion: PhysHPO是首个探索细粒度偏好对齐和数据选择的工作，为更真实和符合人类偏好的视频生成奠定了基础。

Abstract: Recent advancements in video generation have enabled the creation of
high-quality, visually compelling videos. However, generating videos that
adhere to the laws of physics remains a critical challenge for applications
requiring realism and accuracy. In this work, we propose PhysHPO, a novel
framework for Hierarchical Cross-Modal Direct Preference Optimization, to
tackle this challenge by enabling fine-grained preference alignment for
physically plausible video generation. PhysHPO optimizes video alignment across
four hierarchical granularities: a) Instance Level, aligning the overall video
content with the input prompt; b) State Level, ensuring temporal consistency
using boundary frames as anchors; c) Motion Level, modeling motion trajectories
for realistic dynamics; and d) Semantic Level, maintaining logical consistency
between narrative and visuals. Recognizing that real-world videos are the best
reflections of physical phenomena, we further introduce an automated data
selection pipeline to efficiently identify and utilize "good data" from
existing large-scale text-video datasets, thereby eliminating the need for
costly and time-intensive dataset construction. Extensive experiments on both
physics-focused and general capability benchmarks demonstrate that PhysHPO
significantly improves physical plausibility and overall video generation
quality of advanced models. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
work to explore fine-grained preference alignment and data selection for video
generation, paving the way for more realistic and human-preferred video
generation paradigms.

Abstract: Accurate differentiation of brain tumor types on magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI) is critical for guiding treatment planning in neuro-oncology. Recent
advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled visual question answering
(VQA) approaches that integrate image interpretation with natural language
reasoning. In this study, we evaluated GPT-4o, GPT-5-nano, GPT-5-mini, and
GPT-5 on a curated brain tumor VQA benchmark derived from 3 Brain Tumor
Segmentation (BraTS) datasets - glioblastoma (GLI), meningioma (MEN), and brain
metastases (MET). Each case included multi-sequence MRI triplanar mosaics and
structured clinical features transformed into standardized VQA items. Models
were assessed in a zero-shot chain-of-thought setting for accuracy on both
visual and reasoning tasks. Results showed that GPT-5-mini achieved the highest
macro-average accuracy (44.19%), followed by GPT-5 (43.71%), GPT-4o (41.49%),
and GPT-5-nano (35.85%). Performance varied by tumor subtype, with no single
model dominating across all cohorts. These findings suggest that GPT-5 family
models can achieve moderate accuracy in structured neuro-oncological VQA tasks,
but not at a level acceptable for clinical use.

### [101] [ToonComposer: Streamlining Cartoon Production with Generative Post-Keyframing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10881)
*Lingen Li,Guangzhi Wang,Zhaoyang Zhang,Yaowei Li,Xiaoyu Li,Qi Dou,Jinwei Gu,Tianfan Xue,Ying Shan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ToonComposer是一个生成模型，将中间帧生成和上色统一为一个阶段，通过稀疏草图注入和卡通适配方法提升AI辅助卡通制作的效率和质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统卡通制作需要大量手动工作，现有AI方法分阶段处理会导致错误累积和伪影。

Method: ToonComposer结合稀疏草图注入和空间低秩适配器，利用现代视频基础模型，支持单草图或多草图输入。

Result: ToonComposer在视觉质量、运动一致性和生产效率上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ToonComposer为AI辅助卡通制作提供了更高效、灵活的解决方案。

Abstract: Traditional cartoon and anime production involves keyframing, inbetweening,
and colorization stages, which require intensive manual effort. Despite recent
advances in AI, existing methods often handle these stages separately, leading
to error accumulation and artifacts. For instance, inbetweening approaches
struggle with large motions, while colorization methods require dense per-frame
sketches. To address this, we introduce ToonComposer, a generative model that
unifies inbetweening and colorization into a single post-keyframing stage.
ToonComposer employs a sparse sketch injection mechanism to provide precise
control using keyframe sketches. Additionally, it uses a cartoon adaptation
method with the spatial low-rank adapter to tailor a modern video foundation
model to the cartoon domain while keeping its temporal prior intact. Requiring
as few as a single sketch and a colored reference frame, ToonComposer excels
with sparse inputs, while also supporting multiple sketches at any temporal
location for more precise motion control. This dual capability reduces manual
workload and improves flexibility, empowering artists in real-world scenarios.
To evaluate our model, we further created PKBench, a benchmark featuring
human-drawn sketches that simulate real-world use cases. Our evaluation
demonstrates that ToonComposer outperforms existing methods in visual quality,
motion consistency, and production efficiency, offering a superior and more
flexible solution for AI-assisted cartoon production.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: STream3R是一种基于Transformer的3D重建方法，通过流式处理和因果注意力机制高效处理图像序列，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多视图3D重建方法依赖昂贵的全局优化或简单的内存机制，难以处理长序列和动态场景。

Method: 采用解码器-only Transformer框架，利用因果注意力处理图像序列，并结合大规模3D数据集学习几何先验。

Result: 在静态和动态场景基准测试中表现优于现有方法，且支持大规模预训练和微调。

Conclusion: STream3R展示了因果Transformer模型在实时3D感知中的潜力，适用于流式环境。

Abstract: We present STream3R, a novel approach to 3D reconstruction that reformulates
pointmap prediction as a decoder-only Transformer problem. Existing
state-of-the-art methods for multi-view reconstruction either depend on
expensive global optimization or rely on simplistic memory mechanisms that
scale poorly with sequence length. In contrast, STream3R introduces an
streaming framework that processes image sequences efficiently using causal
attention, inspired by advances in modern language modeling. By learning
geometric priors from large-scale 3D datasets, STream3R generalizes well to
diverse and challenging scenarios, including dynamic scenes where traditional
methods often fail. Extensive experiments show that our method consistently
outperforms prior work across both static and dynamic scene benchmarks.
Moreover, STream3R is inherently compatible with LLM-style training
infrastructure, enabling efficient large-scale pretraining and fine-tuning for
various downstream 3D tasks. Our results underscore the potential of causal
Transformer models for online 3D perception, paving the way for real-time 3D
understanding in streaming environments. More details can be found in our

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为MAESTRO的自监督学习方法，针对遥感数据的特点优化了融合策略和目标归一化方案，在多时相任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自监督学习在遥感领域潜力巨大，但需针对地球观测数据的独特特性进行适配。

Method: 通过综合评估融合策略和重建目标归一化方案，提出MAESTRO方法，结合优化的融合策略和光谱先验的自监督信号。

Result: 在四个数据集上评估，MAESTRO在多时相任务中达到新SOTA，同时在单时相任务中保持竞争力。

Conclusion: MAESTRO为遥感数据的自监督学习提供了有效解决方案，代码已开源。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning holds great promise for remote sensing, but standard
self-supervised methods must be adapted to the unique characteristics of Earth
observation data. We take a step in this direction by conducting a
comprehensive benchmark of fusion strategies and reconstruction target
normalization schemes for multimodal, multitemporal, and multispectral Earth
observation data. Based on our findings, we propose MAESTRO, a novel adaptation
of the Masked Autoencoder, featuring optimized fusion strategies and a tailored
target normalization scheme that introduces a spectral prior as a
self-supervisory signal. Evaluated on four Earth observation datasets, MAESTRO
sets a new state-of-the-art on tasks that strongly rely on multitemporal
dynamics, while remaining highly competitive on tasks dominated by a single
mono-temporal modality. Code to reproduce all our experiments is available at

*Jongseo Lee,Kyungho Bae,Kyle Min,Gyeong-Moon Park,Jinwoo Choi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ESSENTIAL提出了一种结合情景记忆和语义记忆的视频类增量学习方法，解决了现有方法在内存效率和性能之间的权衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频类增量学习方法存在内存效率低或性能不足的问题，需要一种平衡两者的解决方案。

Method: ESSENTIAL通过情景记忆存储稀疏特征，语义记忆存储可学习提示，并设计了一个内存检索模块，通过交叉注意力整合两者。

Result: 在多个数据集上验证，ESSENTIAL在显著减少内存的同时，性能表现优异。

Conclusion: ESSENTIAL成功平衡了内存效率和性能，为视频类增量学习提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: In this work, we tackle the problem of video classincremental learning
(VCIL). Many existing VCIL methods mitigate catastrophic forgetting by
rehearsal training with a few temporally dense samples stored in episodic
memory, which is memory-inefficient. Alternatively, some methods store
temporally sparse samples, sacrificing essential temporal information and
thereby resulting in inferior performance. To address this trade-off between
memory-efficiency and performance, we propose EpiSodic and SEmaNTIc memory
integrAtion for video class-incremental Learning (ESSENTIAL). ESSENTIAL
consists of episodic memory for storing temporally sparse features and semantic
memory for storing general knowledge represented by learnable prompts. We
introduce a novel memory retrieval (MR) module that integrates episodic memory
and semantic prompts through cross-attention, enabling the retrieval of
temporally dense features from temporally sparse features. We rigorously
validate ESSENTIAL on diverse datasets: UCF-101, HMDB51, and
Something-Something-V2 from the TCD benchmark and UCF-101, ActivityNet, and
Kinetics-400 from the vCLIMB benchmark. Remarkably, with significantly reduced
memory, ESSENTIAL achieves favorable performance on the benchmarks.

TL;DR: 提出了一种统一跨域3D人体运动模型HiC，通过单阶段训练和通用框架解决现有方法的局限性，显著提升了泛化能力和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有跨域模型依赖领域特定组件和多阶段训练，限制了实用性和可扩展性。

Method: 提出Pose-in-Context (PiC)和Human-in-Context (HiC)，后者结合姿态和网格表示，采用最大-最小相似性提示采样策略和双分支上下文注入架构。

Result: HiC在泛化性、数据规模和性能上优于PiC，适用于多种任务和数据集。

Conclusion: HiC展示了构建统一跨域3D人体运动模型的潜力，具有更高的灵活性和可扩展性。

Abstract: This paper aims to model 3D human motion across domains, where a single model
is expected to handle multiple modalities, tasks, and datasets. Existing
cross-domain models often rely on domain-specific components and multi-stage
training, which limits their practicality and scalability. To overcome these
challenges, we propose a new setting to train a unified cross-domain model
through a single process, eliminating the need for domain-specific components
and multi-stage training. We first introduce Pose-in-Context (PiC), which
leverages in-context learning to create a pose-centric cross-domain model.
While PiC generalizes across multiple pose-based tasks and datasets, it
encounters difficulties with modality diversity, prompting strategy, and
contextual dependency handling. We thus propose Human-in-Context (HiC), an
extension of PiC that broadens generalization across modalities, tasks, and
datasets. HiC combines pose and mesh representations within a unified
framework, expands task coverage, and incorporates larger-scale datasets.
Additionally, HiC introduces a max-min similarity prompt sampling strategy to
enhance generalization across diverse domains and a network architecture with
dual-branch context injection for improved handling of contextual dependencies.
Extensive experimental results show that HiC performs better than PiC in terms
of generalization, data scale, and performance across a wide range of domains.
These results demonstrate the potential of HiC for building a unified
cross-domain 3D human motion model with improved flexibility and scalability.

TL;DR: Puppeteer是一个自动化绑定和动画框架，通过预测骨骼结构和皮肤权重，结合优化动画流程，显著提升3D内容生成效率和质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代交互应用需要动态3D内容，但静态3D模型的动画化仍依赖专家干预，成为内容创作的瓶颈。

Method: 系统通过自回归变换器预测骨骼结构，采用注意力架构推断皮肤权重，并结合可微分优化动画流程。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，该方法在骨骼预测和皮肤质量上显著优于现有技术，并能稳定处理多样3D内容。

Conclusion: Puppeteer框架高效解决了3D动画化问题，适用于专业设计及AI生成的内容，消除了现有方法的抖动问题。

Abstract: Modern interactive applications increasingly demand dynamic 3D content, yet
the transformation of static 3D models into animated assets constitutes a
significant bottleneck in content creation pipelines. While recent advances in
generative AI have revolutionized static 3D model creation, rigging and
animation continue to depend heavily on expert intervention. We present
Puppeteer, a comprehensive framework that addresses both automatic rigging and
animation for diverse 3D objects. Our system first predicts plausible skeletal
structures via an auto-regressive transformer that introduces a joint-based
tokenization strategy for compact representation and a hierarchical ordering
methodology with stochastic perturbation that enhances bidirectional learning
capabilities. It then infers skinning weights via an attention-based
architecture incorporating topology-aware joint attention that explicitly
encodes inter-joint relationships based on skeletal graph distances. Finally,
we complement these rigging advances with a differentiable optimization-based
animation pipeline that generates stable, high-fidelity animations while being
computationally more efficient than existing approaches. Extensive evaluations
across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in both skeletal prediction accuracy
and skinning quality. The system robustly processes diverse 3D content, ranging
from professionally designed game assets to AI-generated shapes, producing
temporally coherent animations that eliminate the jittering issues common in
existing methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新型量子隐式神经表示（QINR），称为量子视觉场（QVF），用于2D图像和3D几何场学习，通过量子态向量编码数据，并在可学习能量流形上实现稳定的训练和快速收敛。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: QINR作为一种新兴范式，在架构设计、量子力学特性利用、训练效率及与经典模块的交互等方面仍存在挑战。本文旨在通过QVF解决这些问题。

Method: QVF采用神经振幅编码将经典数据嵌入量子态向量，使用完全纠缠的可学习参数化量子电路，并在实希尔伯特空间中执行量子操作，确保数值稳定性和快速收敛。

Result: 实验表明，QVF在视觉表示准确性上优于现有量子方法和经典基线，尤其在细节学习方面表现突出，并在2D和3D场补全及形状插值中展示了实用潜力。

Conclusion: QVF为量子隐式神经表示提供了高效稳定的解决方案，展示了在视觉和几何学习中的广泛应用前景。

Abstract: Quantum Implicit Neural Representations (QINRs) include components for
learning and execution on gate-based quantum computers. While QINRs recently
emerged as a promising new paradigm, many challenges concerning their
architecture and ansatz design, the utility of quantum-mechanical properties,
training efficiency and the interplay with classical modules remain. This paper
advances the field by introducing a new type of QINR for 2D image and 3D
geometric field learning, which we collectively refer to as Quantum Visual
Field (QVF). QVF encodes classical data into quantum statevectors using neural
amplitude encoding grounded in a learnable energy manifold, ensuring meaningful
Hilbert space embeddings. Our ansatz follows a fully entangled design of
learnable parametrised quantum circuits, with quantum (unitary) operations
performed in the real Hilbert space, resulting in numerically stable training
with fast convergence. QVF does not rely on classical post-processing -- in
contrast to the previous QINR learning approach -- and directly employs
projective measurement to extract learned signals encoded in the ansatz.
Experiments on a quantum hardware simulator demonstrate that QVF outperforms
the existing quantum approach and widely used classical foundational baselines
in terms of visual representation accuracy across various metrics and model
characteristics, such as learning of high-frequency details. We also show
applications of QVF in 2D and 3D field completion and 3D shape interpolation,
highlighting its practical potential.

Abstract: Automating data extraction from clinical documents offers significant
potential to improve efficiency in healthcare settings, yet deploying Natural
Language Processing (NLP) solutions presents practical challenges. Drawing upon
our experience implementing various NLP models for information extraction and
classification tasks at the British Columbia Cancer Registry (BCCR), this paper
shares key lessons learned throughout the project lifecycle. We emphasize the
critical importance of defining problems based on clear business objectives
rather than solely technical accuracy, adopting an iterative approach to
development, and fostering deep interdisciplinary collaboration and co-design
involving domain experts, end-users, and ML specialists from inception. Further
insights highlight the need for pragmatic model selection (including hybrid
approaches and simpler methods where appropriate), rigorous attention to data
quality (representativeness, drift, annotation), robust error mitigation
strategies involving human-in-the-loop validation and ongoing audits, and
building organizational AI literacy. These practical considerations,
generalizable beyond cancer registries, provide guidance for healthcare
organizations seeking to successfully implement AI/NLP solutions to enhance
data management processes and ultimately improve patient care and public health
outcomes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于大语言模型在现实应用中的公平性问题日益突出，尤其是在高风险的领域，因此需要一种可验证且不可篡改的评估方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in realworld
applications, yet concerns about their fairness persist especially in
highstakes domains like criminal justice, education, healthcare, and finance.
This paper introduces transparent evaluation protocol for benchmarking the
fairness of opensource LLMs using smart contracts on the Internet Computer
Protocol (ICP) blockchain (Foundation, 2023). Our method ensures verifiable,
immutable, and reproducible evaluations by executing onchain HTTP requests to
hosted Hugging Face endpoints and storing datasets, prompts, and metrics
directly onchain. We benchmark the Llama, DeepSeek, and Mistral models on the
PISA dataset for academic performance prediction (OECD, 2018), a dataset
suitable for fairness evaluation using statistical parity and equal opportunity
metrics (Hardt et al., 2016). We also evaluate structured Context Association
Metrics derived from the StereoSet dataset (Nadeem et al., 2020) to measure
social bias in contextual associations. We further extend our analysis with a
multilingual evaluation across English, Spanish, and Portuguese using the
Kaleidoscope benchmark (Salazar et al., 2025), revealing cross-linguistic
disparities. All code and results are open source, enabling community audits
and longitudinal fairness tracking across model versions.

Motivation: 以往研究缺乏对内容或主题的分类，且任务分类在K-12教育中缺乏真实数据支持，本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 采用新颖的主题建模方法，结合LLMs（大语言模型）和预处理技术，对消息进行内容和任务维度的分层分类。

Result: 分析揭示了新的应用场景，并表明传统方法在处理大规模文本时表现不佳，而改进后的方法能更好地与人类对齐。

Conclusion: 研究为教育工作者和学生提供了GenAI的使用参考，同时指出了未来研究的关注点和开放性问题。

Abstract: We analyze anonymous interaction data of minors in class-rooms spanning
several months, schools, and subjects employing a novel, simple topic modeling
approach. Specifically, we categorize more than 17,000 messages generated by
students, teachers, and ChatGPT in two dimensions: content (such as nature and
people) and tasks (such as writing and explaining). Our hierarchical
categorization done separately for each dimension includes exemplary prompts,
and provides both a high-level overview as well as tangible insights. Prior
works mostly lack a content or thematic categorization. While task
categorizations are more prevalent in education, most have not been supported
by real-world data for K-12. In turn, it is not surprising that our analysis
yielded a number of novel applications. In deriving these insights, we found
that many of the well-established classical and emerging computational methods,
i.e., topic modeling, for analysis of large amounts of texts underperform,
leading us to directly apply state-of-the-art LLMs with adequate pre-processing
to achieve hierarchical topic structures with better human alignment through
explicit instructions than prior approaches. Our findings support fellow
researchers, teachers and students in enriching the usage of GenAI, while our
discussion also highlights a number of concerns and open questions for future
research.

Method: 基于心理学理论和用户数据，开发了包含31种行为的分类法，并通过368个针对性提示评估模型反应。

Result: 所有模型普遍表现出强化陪伴行为，但不同模型在敏感部分的行为差异显著。

Conclusion: 需要更一致的方法处理情感互动，以确保用户福祉。

Abstract: AI companionship, where users develop emotional bonds with AI systems, has
emerged as a significant pattern with positive but also concerning
implications. We introduce Interactions and Machine Attachment Benchmark
(INTIMA), a benchmark for evaluating companionship behaviors in language
models. Drawing from psychological theories and user data, we develop a
taxonomy of 31 behaviors across four categories and 368 targeted prompts.
Responses to these prompts are evaluated as companionship-reinforcing,
boundary-maintaining, or neutral. Applying INTIMA to Gemma-3, Phi-4, o3-mini,
and Claude-4 reveals that companionship-reinforcing behaviors remain much more
common across all models, though we observe marked differences between models.
Different commercial providers prioritize different categories within the more
sensitive parts of the benchmark, which is concerning since both appropriate
boundary-setting and emotional support matter for user well-being. These
findings highlight the need for more consistent approaches to handling
emotionally charged interactions.

Conclusion: 研究为多模态虚假信息检测领域提供了有价值的见解和实践方法。

Abstract: The rapid spread of multimodal misinformation on social media calls for more
effective and robust detection methods. Recent advances leveraging multimodal
large language models (MLLMs) have shown the potential in addressing this
challenge. However, it remains unclear exactly where the bottleneck of existing
approaches lies (evidence retrieval v.s. reasoning), hindering the further
advances in this field. On the dataset side, existing benchmarks either contain
outdated events, leading to evaluation bias due to discrepancies with
contemporary social media scenarios as MLLMs can simply memorize these events,
or artificially synthetic, failing to reflect real-world misinformation
patterns. Additionally, it lacks comprehensive analyses of MLLM-based model
design strategies. To address these issues, we introduce XFacta, a
contemporary, real-world dataset that is better suited for evaluating
MLLM-based detectors. We systematically evaluate various MLLM-based
misinformation detection strategies, assessing models across different
architectures and scales, as well as benchmarking against existing detection
methods. Building on these analyses, we further enable a semi-automatic
detection-in-the-loop framework that continuously updates XFacta with new
content to maintain its contemporary relevance. Our analysis provides valuable
insights and practices for advancing the field of multimodal misinformation
detection. The code and data have been released.

Conclusion: 通过LLM生成合成数据并结合自动化工作流，可有效解决数据不足问题，提升模型性能。

Abstract: When developing text classification models for real world applications, one
major challenge is the difficulty to collect sufficient data for all text
classes. In this work, we address this challenge by utilizing large language
models (LLMs) to generate synthetic data and using such data to improve the
performance of the models without waiting for more real data to be collected
and labelled. As an LLM generates different synthetic data in response to
different input examples, we formulate an automated workflow, which searches
for input examples that lead to more ``effective'' synthetic data for improving
the model concerned. We study three search strategies with an extensive set of
experiments, and use experiment results to inform an ensemble algorithm that
selects a search strategy according to the characteristics of a class. Our
further experiments demonstrate that this ensemble approach is more effective
than each individual strategy in our automated workflow for improving
classification models using LLMs.

### [115] [HiFACTMix: A Code-Mixed Benchmark and Graph-Aware Model for EvidenceBased Political Claim Verification in Hinglish](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10001)
*Rakesh Thakur,Sneha Sharma,Gauri Chopra*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一个针对低资源混合语言（如Hinglish）的事实核查数据集HiFACT，并开发了一种基于图神经网络的模型HiFACTMix，显著优于现有多语言基线模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有事实核查系统主要针对高资源单语言环境，无法适应印度等语言多样化地区的政治话语，而Hinglish在公共人物中的广泛使用和社会媒体的影响使得开发多语言、上下文感知的事实核查工具变得迫切。

Method: 提出了HiFACT数据集（包含1500条Hinglish政治声明），并开发了一种结合多语言上下文编码、语义对齐、证据图构建、图神经网络推理和自然语言解释生成的模型。

Result: HiFACTMix模型在准确性上优于现有多语言基线模型，并能提供可信的验证解释。

Conclusion: 该研究为多语言、混合语言和政治背景的事实核查开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Fact-checking in code-mixed, low-resource languages such as Hinglish remains
an underexplored challenge in natural language processing. Existing
fact-verification systems largely focus on high-resource, monolingual settings
and fail to generalize to real-world political discourse in linguistically
diverse regions like India. Given the widespread use of Hinglish by public
figures, particularly political figures, and the growing influence of social
media on public opinion, there's a critical need for robust, multilingual and
context-aware fact-checking tools. To address this gap a novel benchmark HiFACT
dataset is introduced with 1,500 realworld factual claims made by 28 Indian
state Chief Ministers in Hinglish, under a highly code-mixed low-resource
setting. Each claim is annotated with textual evidence and veracity labels. To
evaluate this benchmark, a novel graphaware, retrieval-augmented fact-checking
model is proposed that combines multilingual contextual encoding,
claim-evidence semantic alignment, evidence graph construction, graph neural
reasoning, and natural language explanation generation. Experimental results
show that HiFACTMix outperformed accuracy in comparison to state of art
multilingual baselines models and provides faithful justifications for its
verdicts. This work opens a new direction for multilingual, code-mixed, and
politically grounded fact verification research.

### [116] [Semantic Structure in Large Language Model Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10003)
*Austin C. Kozlowski,Callin Dai,Andrei Boutyline*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，人类对词语的语义评分与大型语言模型（LLM）的词嵌入矩阵中的语义关联结构相似，均能简化为低维形式。通过反义词对定义的语义方向，LLM的词投影与人类评分高度相关，且可简化为3维子空间。语义特征在LLM中相互纠缠，类似于人类语言，且语义信息虽复杂但维度较低。理解这种结构对避免意外后果至关重要。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索人类语义评分与LLM词嵌入结构的相似性，以及语义特征在LLM中的低维表现。

Method: 通过反义词对定义语义方向，分析LLM词嵌入的投影与人类评分的相关性，并研究其低维子空间结构。

Result: LLM的词嵌入结构与人类语义评分高度相关，且语义特征可简化为3维子空间；语义特征在LLM中相互纠缠。

Conclusion: 语义信息在LLM中呈现低维结构，理解这种结构对避免意外后果至关重要。

Abstract: Psychological research consistently finds that human ratings of words across
diverse semantic scales can be reduced to a low-dimensional form with
relatively little information loss. We find that the semantic associations
encoded in the embedding matrices of large language models (LLMs) exhibit a
similar structure. We show that the projections of words on semantic directions
defined by antonym pairs (e.g. kind - cruel) correlate highly with human
ratings, and further find that these projections effectively reduce to a
3-dimensional subspace within LLM embeddings, closely resembling the patterns
derived from human survey responses. Moreover, we find that shifting tokens
along one semantic direction causes off-target effects on geometrically aligned
features proportional to their cosine similarity. These findings suggest that
semantic features are entangled within LLMs similarly to how they are
interconnected in human language, and a great deal of semantic information,
despite its apparent complexity, is surprisingly low-dimensional. Furthermore,
accounting for this semantic structure may prove essential for avoiding
unintended consequences when steering features.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探讨了注意力权重在生物医学文档分类中的解释性作用及其可视化方式对用户感知的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在基于证据的医学中，注意力权重可能帮助医生理解AI系统的预测，但其解释性和可视化方式的有效性尚未达成共识。

Method: 通过用户研究，评估了注意力权重对生物医学文档分类的帮助，并比较了不同可视化方式的效果。

Result: XLNet模型分类准确，但注意力权重解释性有限；可视化方式显著影响用户感知，用户偏好直观形式（如文本亮度或背景色）。

Conclusion: 注意力权重的解释性受可视化方式影响，但整体效用未得到证实。

Abstract: The attention mechanism is a core component of the Transformer architecture.
Beyond improving performance, attention has been proposed as a mechanism for
explainability via attention weights, which are associated with input features
(e.g., tokens in a document). In this context, larger attention weights may
imply more relevant features for the model's prediction. In evidence-based
medicine, such explanations could support physicians' understanding and
interaction with AI systems used to categorize biomedical literature. However,
there is still no consensus on whether attention weights provide helpful
explanations. Moreover, little research has explored how visualizing attention
affects its usefulness as an explanation aid. To bridge this gap, we conducted
a user study to evaluate whether attention-based explanations support users in
biomedical document classification and whether there is a preferred way to
visualize them. The study involved medical experts from various disciplines who
classified articles based on study design (e.g., systematic reviews, broad
synthesis, randomized and non-randomized trials). Our findings show that the
Transformer model (XLNet) classified documents accurately; however, the
attention weights were not perceived as particularly helpful for explaining the
predictions. However, this perception varied significantly depending on how
attention was visualized. Contrary to Munzner's principle of visual
effectiveness, which favors precise encodings like bar length, users preferred
more intuitive formats, such as text brightness or background color. While our
results do not confirm the overall utility of attention weights for
explanation, they suggest that their perceived helpfulness is influenced by how
they are visually presented.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大语言模型在数学解题方面表现优异，但生成高质量教育问题的能力仍需探索。EQGBench旨在推动EQG发展，帮助模型生成更具教育价值的问题。

Method: 引入EQGBench基准，包含900个评估样本，覆盖数学、物理和化学三个学科，并建立五维评估框架。

Result: 对46个主流大模型的系统评估显示，模型在生成教育有效性问题方面仍有显著提升空间。

Conclusion: EQGBench为EQG提供了标准化评估工具，揭示了模型在教育问题生成中的不足，为未来研究指明了方向。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
mathematical problem-solving. However, the transition from providing answers to
generating high-quality educational questions presents significant challenges
that remain underexplored. To advance Educational Question Generation (EQG) and
facilitate LLMs in generating pedagogically valuable and educationally
effective questions, we introduce EQGBench, a comprehensive benchmark
specifically designed for evaluating LLMs' performance in Chinese EQG. EQGBench
establishes a five-dimensional evaluation framework supported by a dataset of
900 evaluation samples spanning three fundamental middle school disciplines:
mathematics, physics, and chemistry. The dataset incorporates user queries with
varying knowledge points, difficulty gradients, and question type
specifications to simulate realistic educational scenarios. Through systematic
evaluation of 46 mainstream large models, we reveal significant room for
development in generating questions that reflect educational value and foster
students' comprehensive abilities.

*Y. Lyu,D. Combs,D. Neumann,Y. C. Leong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探讨了大型语言模型能否自动化评分AIHQ开放式回答，结果显示模型评分与人工评分一致，且能推广到非临床数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统AIHQ开放式问题评分耗时，需人工评分，研究旨在利用大型语言模型实现自动化评分。

Method: 使用创伤性脑损伤患者和健康对照组的数据集，对模型进行微调，测试其评分与人工评分的一致性。

Result: 模型评分与人工评分高度一致，且能区分不同组别的敌意归因差异，推广性良好。

Conclusion: 大型语言模型可有效自动化AIHQ评分，适用于研究和临床场景。

Abstract: Hostile attribution bias is the tendency to interpret social interactions as
intentionally hostile. The Ambiguous Intentions Hostility Questionnaire (AIHQ)
is commonly used to measure hostile attribution bias, and includes open-ended
questions where participants describe the perceived intentions behind a
negative social situation and how they would respond. While these questions
provide insights into the contents of hostile attributions, they require
time-intensive scoring by human raters. In this study, we assessed whether
large language models can automate the scoring of AIHQ open-ended responses. We
used a previously collected dataset in which individuals with traumatic brain
injury (TBI) and healthy controls (HC) completed the AIHQ and had their
open-ended responses rated by trained human raters. We used half of these
responses to fine-tune the two models on human-generated ratings, and tested
the fine-tuned models on the remaining half of AIHQ responses. Results showed
that model-generated ratings aligned with human ratings for both attributions
of hostility and aggression responses, with fine-tuned models showing higher
alignment. This alignment was consistent across ambiguous, intentional, and
accidental scenario types, and replicated previous findings on group
differences in attributions of hostility and aggression responses between TBI
and HC groups. The fine-tuned models also generalized well to an independent
nonclinical dataset. To support broader adoption, we provide an accessible
scoring interface that includes both local and cloud-based options. Together,
our findings suggest that large language models can streamline AIHQ scoring in
both research and clinical contexts, revealing their potential to facilitate
psychological assessments across different populations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线课程讨论论坛的自动管理需要频繁更新，导致LLM的重复训练资源消耗大。本文旨在减少对昂贵微调的依赖。

Method: 提出贝叶斯融合方法，结合预训练通用LLM和本地数据分类器的多维分类分数。

Result: 实验表明，融合方法比单独使用任一分类器效果更好，且与微调LLM方法性能相当。

Conclusion: 贝叶斯融合是一种高效替代方案，避免了LLM的昂贵微调，同时提升了分类性能。

Abstract: The automatic curation of discussion forums in online courses requires
constant updates, making frequent retraining of Large Language Models (LLMs) a
resource-intensive process. To circumvent the need for costly fine-tuning, this
paper proposes and evaluates the use of Bayesian fusion. The approach combines
the multidimensional classification scores of a pre-trained generic LLM with
those of a classifier trained on local data. The performance comparison
demonstrated that the proposed fusion improves the results compared to each
classifier individually, and is competitive with the LLM fine-tuning approach

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RTTC是一种通过预训练奖励模型自适应选择最佳TTC策略的新框架，旨在最大化下游任务准确性，同时减少计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有TTC策略（如TTT和RAG）对不同查询的适应性不足，且盲目应用会导致高计算成本。

Method: RTTC采用分布式服务器-客户端架构，通过奖励模型动态选择策略，并结合查询状态缓存以减少冗余计算。

Result: 实验表明，RTTC在多种LLM和基准测试中均优于传统RAG或TTT。

Conclusion: RTTC证明了自适应TTC策略的必要性，并展示了其在高效语言模型适配中的潜力。

Abstract: Test-Time Compute (TTC) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for enhancing the
performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) at inference, leveraging strategies
such as Test-Time Training (TTT) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).
However, the optimal adaptation strategy varies across queries, and
indiscriminate application of TTC strategy incurs substantial computational
overhead. In this work, we introduce Reward-Guided Test-Time Compute (RTTC), a
novel framework that adaptively selects the most effective TTC strategy for
each query via a pretrained reward model, maximizing downstream accuracy across
diverse domains and tasks. RTTC operates in a distributed server-client
architecture, retrieving relevant samples from a remote knowledge base and
applying RAG or lightweight fine-tuning on client devices only when necessary.
To further mitigate redundant computation, we propose Query-State Caching,
which enables the efficient reuse of historical query states at both retrieval
and adaptation levels. Extensive experiments across multiple LLMs and
benchmarks demonstrate that RTTC consistently achieves superior accuracy
compared to vanilla RAG or TTT, validating the necessity of adaptive,
reward-guided TTC selection and the potential of RTTC for scalable,
high-performance language model adaptation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 硬参数共享在多任务学习中常导致任务干扰，影响模型性能，因此需要一种更有效的方法来避免这一问题。

Method: 提出S-MoE模型，利用引导令牌将任务分配到独立的专家网络，无需训练门控函数。

Result: 在语音转文本任务中，S-MoE显著提升了性能，词错误率相对降低了6.35%。

Conclusion: S-MoE是一种简单有效的多任务学习方法，能够显著减少任务干扰并提升模型性能。

Abstract: Hard-parameter sharing is a common strategy to train a single model jointly
across diverse tasks. However, this often leads to task interference, impeding
overall model performance. To address the issue, we propose a simple yet
effective Supervised Mixture of Experts (S-MoE). Unlike traditional Mixture of
Experts models, S-MoE eliminates the need for training gating functions by
utilizing special guiding tokens to route each task to its designated expert.
By assigning each task to a separate feedforward network, S-MoE overcomes the
limitations of hard-parameter sharing. We further apply S-MoE to a
speech-to-text model, enabling the model to process mixed-bandwidth input while
jointly performing automatic speech recognition (ASR) and speech translation
(ST). Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed S-MoE,
achieving a 6.35% relative improvement in Word Error Rate (WER) when applied to
both the encoder and decoder.

Motivation: 传统选择策略未能有效指导LLMs在信息提取任务中的表现，因为它们忽略了模型在生成结构化格式时的困惑。

Method: 提出APIE框架，通过量化格式不确定性和内容不确定性，主动选择最具挑战性的样本作为少样本示例。

Result: 在四个基准测试中，APIE显著优于基线方法，提升了提取准确性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 研究表明，细粒度的双级模型不确定性视角对构建高效可靠的结构化生成系统至关重要。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) show remarkable potential for few-shot
information extraction (IE), yet their performance is highly sensitive to the
choice of in-context examples. Conventional selection strategies often fail to
provide informative guidance, as they overlook a key source of model
fallibility: confusion stemming not just from semantic content, but also from
the generation of well-structured formats required by IE tasks. To address
this, we introduce Active Prompting for Information Extraction (APIE), a novel
active prompting framework guided by a principle we term introspective
confusion. Our method empowers an LLM to assess its own confusion through a
dual-component uncertainty metric that uniquely quantifies both Format
Uncertainty (difficulty in generating correct syntax) and Content Uncertainty
(inconsistency in extracted semantics). By ranking unlabeled data with this
comprehensive score, our framework actively selects the most challenging and
informative samples to serve as few-shot exemplars. Extensive experiments on
four benchmarks show that our approach consistently outperforms strong
baselines, yielding significant improvements in both extraction accuracy and
robustness. Our work highlights the critical importance of a fine-grained,
dual-level view of model uncertainty when it comes to building effective and
reliable structured generation systems.

Motivation: LLM可能被用于生成或检测错误信息，研究其越狱攻击的特性和效果有助于理解其双刃剑作用。

Method: 分析了109种针对三种目标LLM的越狱攻击，比较了攻击提示与真实健康相关查询，并评估了生成错误信息的检测效果。

Result: LLM生成的错误信息与Reddit上的健康错误信息相似，且LLM能有效检测错误信息。

Conclusion: 研究表明，通过精心设计，LLM可以促进更健康的信息生态系统。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are a double-edged sword capable of generating
harmful misinformation -- inadvertently, or when prompted by "jailbreak"
attacks that attempt to produce malicious outputs. LLMs could, with additional
research, be used to detect and prevent the spread of misinformation. In this
paper, we investigate the efficacy and characteristics of LLM-produced
jailbreak attacks that cause other models to produce harmful medical
misinformation. We also study how misinformation generated by jailbroken LLMs
compares to typical misinformation found on social media, and how effectively
it can be detected using standard machine learning approaches. Specifically, we
closely examine 109 distinct attacks against three target LLMs and compare the
attack prompts to in-the-wild health-related LLM queries. We also examine the
resulting jailbreak responses, comparing the generated misinformation to
health-related misinformation on Reddit. Our findings add more evidence that
LLMs can be effectively used to detect misinformation from both other LLMs and
from people, and support a body of work suggesting that with careful design,
LLMs can contribute to a healthier overall information ecosystem.

Motivation: 探讨生成式AI在营养教育领域的潜力，尤其是在注册营养师考试中的辅助学习效果。

Method: 使用考试题目作为提示，测试ChatGPT和三种Bing模型的准确性、一致性和响应时间，并尝试提示工程改进性能。

Result: Bing-Precise和Bing-Creative勉强超过及格线（60%），但所有模型在答案一致性和稳定性方面表现不佳。

Conclusion: 当前生成式AI模型在营养师考试辅助学习中仍有局限性，需进一步改进以实现可靠稳定的表现。

Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (AI) based on large language models
(LLMs), such as ChatGPT, has demonstrated remarkable progress across various
professional fields, including medicine and education. However, their
performance in nutritional education, especially in Japanese national licensure
examination for registered dietitians, remains underexplored. This study aimed
to evaluate the potential of current LLM-based generative AI models as study
aids for nutrition students. Questions from the Japanese national examination
for registered dietitians were used as prompts for ChatGPT and three Bing
models (Precise, Creative, Balanced), based on GPT-3.5 and GPT-4. Each question
was entered into independent sessions, and model responses were analyzed for
accuracy, consistency, and response time. Additional prompt engineering,
including role assignment, was tested to assess potential performance
improvements. Bing-Precise (66.2%) and Bing-Creative (61.4%) surpassed the
passing threshold (60%), while Bing-Balanced (43.3%) and ChatGPT (42.8%) did
not. Bing-Precise and Bing-Creative generally outperformed others across
subject fields except Nutrition Education, where all models underperformed.
None of the models consistently provided the same correct responses across
repeated attempts, highlighting limitations in answer stability. ChatGPT showed
greater consistency in response patterns but lower accuracy. Prompt engineering
had minimal effect, except for modest improvement when correct answers and
explanations were explicitly provided. While some generative AI models
marginally exceeded the passing threshold, overall accuracy and answer
consistency remained suboptimal. Moreover, all the models demonstrated notable
limitations in answer consistency and robustness. Further advancements are
needed to ensure reliable and stable AI-based study aids for dietitian
licensure preparation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在知识密集型任务中表现受限，因其依赖静态知识和不透明的推理过程。知识图谱（KGs）虽提供解决方案，但现有方法存在粒度不匹配或无法有效利用上下文信息的问题。

Method: 提出GG Explore框架，引入中间引导图（Guidance Graph）连接非结构化查询和结构化知识检索。框架包括结构对齐（过滤不兼容候选）和上下文感知剪枝（确保语义一致性）。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在复杂任务中效率更高，性能优于现有技术（SOTA），且在小规模LLMs上仍保持强性能。

Conclusion: GG Explore通过引导图有效解决了知识检索中的效率与性能问题，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit strong linguistic capabilities,
their reliance on static knowledge and opaque reasoning processes limits their
performance in knowledge intensive tasks. Knowledge graphs (KGs) offer a
promising solution, but current exploration methods face a fundamental trade
off: question guided approaches incur redundant exploration due to granularity
mismatches, while clue guided methods fail to effectively leverage contextual
information for complex scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose
Guidance Graph guided Knowledge Exploration (GG Explore), a novel framework
that introduces an intermediate Guidance Graph to bridge unstructured queries
and structured knowledge retrieval. The Guidance Graph defines the retrieval
space by abstracting the target knowledge' s structure while preserving broader
semantic context, enabling precise and efficient exploration. Building upon the
Guidance Graph, we develop: (1) Structural Alignment that filters incompatible
candidates without LLM overhead, and (2) Context Aware Pruning that enforces
semantic consistency with graph constraints. Extensive experiments show our
method achieves superior efficiency and outperforms SOTA, especially on complex
tasks, while maintaining strong performance with smaller LLMs, demonstrating
practical value.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Semantic Bridge的框架，通过语义图编织技术（如实体桥接、谓词链桥接和因果桥接）从稀疏数据中生成可控的多跳推理问题，显著提升了LLM训练数据的质量和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM训练中高质量、推理密集型问答对稀缺的问题，尤其是来自稀疏领域（如医学或法律文献）的数据。现有方法无法生成可控的复杂多跳推理问题。

Method: 提出Semantic Bridge框架，利用三种桥接机制（实体桥接、谓词链桥接、因果桥接）和AMR驱动的分析，系统构建跨文档的复杂推理路径。

Result: 在多语言和多领域（如维基百科和生物医学）测试中，性能显著优于基线方法（提升18.3%-25.4%）。生成的问题对质量优于人工标注，且材料消耗减少67%。

Conclusion: Semantic Bridge为LLM训练数据合成提供了新范式，能够从稀疏数据中可控生成目标推理问题，显著提升数据质量和效率。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) training faces a critical bottleneck: the scarcity
of high-quality, reasoning-intensive question-answer pairs, especially from
sparse, domain-specific sources like PubMed papers or legal documents. Existing
methods rely on surface patterns, fundamentally failing to generate
controllable, complex multi-hop reasoning questions that test genuine
understanding-essential for advancing LLM training paradigms. We present
\textbf{Semantic Bridge}, the first universal framework for controllably
generating sophisticated multi-hop reasoning questions from arbitrary sources.
Our breakthrough innovation is \textit{semantic graph weaving}-three
complementary bridging mechanisms (entity bridging for role-varying shared
entities, predicate chain bridging for temporal/causal/logical sequences, and
causal bridging for explicit reasoning chains)-that systematically construct
complex pathways across documents, with fine-grained control over complexity
and types via AMR-driven analysis. Our multi-modal AMR pipeline achieves up to
9.5% better round-trip quality, enabling production-ready controllable QA
generation. Extensive evaluation demonstrates performance across both
general-purpose datasets (Wikipedia) and specialized domains (biomedicine) It
yields consistent 18.3%-25.4% gains over baselines across four languages
(English, Chinese, French, German). Question pairs generated from 200 sources
outperform 600 native human annotation examples with 67% fewer materials. Human
evaluation shows 23.4% higher complexity, 18.7% better answerability, and 31.2%
improved pattern coverage. Semantic Bridge establishes a new paradigm for LLM
training data synthesis, enabling controllable generation of targeted reasoning
questions from sparse sources. We will release our core code and semantic
bridge model.

TL;DR: 当前角色扮演研究依赖未经验证的LLM评判范式，可能无法反映人类对角色的感知。PersonaEval是首个测试LLM能否可靠识别角色的基准，结果显示LLM准确率仅69%，远低于人类的90.8%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在验证LLM是否能可靠识别对话中的角色，这是评判角色扮演质量的前提。

Method: 提出PersonaEval基准，使用人类创作的对话数据测试LLM的角色识别能力，并进行人类对比实验。

Result: 最佳LLM准确率为69%，人类为90.8%，显示LLM在角色识别上仍不足。

Conclusion: 可靠的角色扮演评估需LLM具备更强的人类推理能力，而非仅任务调优。

Abstract: Current role-play studies often rely on unvalidated LLM-as-a-judge paradigms,
which may fail to reflect how humans perceive role fidelity. A key prerequisite
for human-aligned evaluation is role identification, the ability to recognize
who is speaking based on dialogue context. We argue that any meaningful
judgment of role-playing quality (how well a character is played) fundamentally
depends on first correctly attributing words and actions to the correct persona
(who is speaking). We present PersonaEval, the first benchmark designed to test
whether LLM evaluators can reliably identify human roles. PersonaEval uses
human-authored dialogues from novels, scripts, and video transcripts,
challenging models to determine the correct persona according to the
conversation context. Our experiments, including a human study, show that even
the best-performing LLMs reach only around 69% accuracy, well below the level
needed for reliable evaluation. In contrast, human participants perform near
ceiling with 90.8% accuracy, highlighting that current LLM evaluators are still
not human enough to effectively judge role-play scenarios. To better understand
this gap, we examine training-time adaptation and test-time compute, suggesting
that reliable evaluation requires more than task-specific tuning, but depends
on strong, human-like reasoning abilities in LLM evaluators. We release our
benchmark at https://github.com/maple-zhou/PersonaEval.

### [129] [Learning from Natural Language Feedback for Personalized Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10695)
*Alireza Salemi,Hamed Zamani*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出VAC框架，用自然语言反馈（NLF）替代标量奖励，优化个性化问答任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于标量奖励的个性化方法反馈较弱，限制了学习效率和个性化质量。

Method: VAC框架通过交替优化反馈模型和策略模型，利用NLF作为监督信号。

Result: 在LaMP-QA基准测试中表现优于现有方法，人类评估也证实生成回答质量更高。

Conclusion: NLF为个性化问答提供了更有效的优化信号。

Abstract: Personalization is crucial for enhancing both the effectiveness and user
satisfaction of language technologies, particularly in information-seeking
tasks like question answering. Current approaches for personalizing large
language models (LLMs) often rely on retrieval-augmented generation (RAG),
followed by reinforcement learning with scalar reward signals to teach models
how to use retrieved personal context. We believe that these scalar rewards
sometimes provide weak, non-instructive feedback, limiting learning efficiency
and personalization quality. We introduce VAC, a novel framework for
personalized response generation that replaces scalar rewards with natural
language feedback (NLF) that are generated conditioned on the user profiles and
the question narratives. NLF serves as a rich and actionable supervision
signal, allowing the policy model to iteratively refine its outputs and
internalize effective personalization strategies. Training alternates between
optimizing the feedback model and fine-tuning the policy model on the improved
responses, resulting in a policy model that no longer requires feedback at
inference. Evaluation on the LaMP-QA benchmark that consists of three diverse
domains demonstrates consistent and significant improvements over the
state-of-the-art results. Human evaluations further confirm the superior
quality of the generated responses. These results demonstrate that NLF provides
more effective signals for optimizing personalized question answering.

Motivation: 现有任务导向对话数据集多为文本或仅限英语，缺乏真实语音信号和中文数据，无法全面评估语音大模型的鲁棒性。

Method: 构建了包含5.4k对话（60K话语，150小时）的中文语音-文本双模态数据集RealTalk-CN，并设计跨模态聊天任务。

Result: 实验验证了数据集的有效性，为中文语音大模型研究奠定了基础。

Conclusion: RealTalk-CN填补了中文语音任务导向对话数据集的空白，为未来研究提供了重要资源。

Abstract: In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable
advancements in multimodal processing, including end-to-end speech-based
language models that enable natural interactions and perform specific tasks in
task-oriented dialogue (TOD) systems. However, existing TOD datasets are
predominantly text-based, lacking real speech signals that are essential for
evaluating the robustness of speech-based LLMs. Moreover, existing speech TOD
datasets are primarily English and lack critical aspects such as speech
disfluencies and speaker variations. To address these gaps, we introduce
RealTalk-CN, the first Chinese multi-turn, multi-domain speech-text dual-modal
TOD dataset, comprising 5.4k dialogues (60K utterances, 150 hours) with paired
speech-text annotations. RealTalk-CN captures diverse dialogue scenarios with
annotated spontaneous speech disfluencies, ensuring comprehensive coverage of
real-world complexities in speech dialogue. In addition, we propose a novel
cross-modal chat task that authentically simulates real-world user
interactions, allowing dynamic switching between speech and text modalities.
Our evaluation covers robustness to speech disfluencies, sensitivity to speaker
characteristics, and cross-domain performance. Extensive experiments validate
the effectiveness of RealTalk-CN, establishing a strong foundation for Chinese
speech-based LLMs research.

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需额外训练的多模态大语言模型协调方法（MLLM Orchestration），通过显式工作流协调专用模型，提升交互效率、模块化和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLM难以直接整合为统一的多模态输入输出系统，传统方法依赖训练且面临模态对齐、效率等问题。

Method: 基于三个创新：中央控制器LLM动态路由任务、并行TTS架构实现全双工交互、跨模态记忆集成系统。

Result: 性能提升7.8%，延迟降低10.3%，显著增强可解释性。

Conclusion: MLLM Orchestration无需训练即可实现高效多模态交互，优于传统联合训练方法。

Abstract: Different Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) cannot be integrated into
a unified multimodal input-output system directly. In previous work, training
has been considered as an inevitable component due to challenges in modal
alignment, Text-to-Speech efficiency and other integration issues. In this
paper, we introduce Multimodal Large Language Model Orchestration, an effective
approach for creating interactive multimodal AI systems without additional
training. MLLM Orchestration leverages the inherent reasoning capabilities of
large language models to coordinate specialized models through explicit
workflows, enabling natural multimodal interactions while maintaining
modularity, improving interpretability, and significantly enhancing
computational efficiency. Our orchestration framework is built upon three key
innovations: (1) a central controller LLM that analyzes user inputs and
dynamically routes tasks to appropriate specialized models through carefully
designed agents; (2) a parallel Text-to-Speech architecture that enables true
full-duplex interaction with seamless interruption handling and natural
conversational flow; and (3) a cross-modal memory integration system that
maintains coherent context across modalities through intelligent information
synthesis and retrieval, selectively avoiding unnecessary modality calls in
certain scenarios to improve response speed. Extensive evaluations demonstrate
that MLLM Orchestration achieves comprehensive multimodal capabilities without
additional training, performance improvements of up to 7.8% over traditional
jointly-trained approaches on standard benchmarks, reduced latency by 10.3%,
and significantly enhanced interpretability through explicit orchestration
processes.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于范畴同伦理论的框架，用于解决大语言模型（LLMs）在处理语义相同但表达不同的句子时生成不一致概率的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自然语言中存在许多语义相同但表达不同的句子，LLMs通常无法为这些句子生成一致的下一个词概率。现有方法（如k-NN平滑估计）是经验性的，缺乏理论支持。

Method: 引入LLM Markov范畴来表示LLM生成的语言概率分布，并利用范畴同伦技术捕捉“弱等价”关系，以解决语义相同句子在范畴中生成非同构箭头的问题。

Result: 通过应用范畴同伦理论（从高阶代数K理论到模型范畴），论文为LLMs提供了一种理论框架，能够更抽象地处理语义等价性问题。

Conclusion: 论文提出的范畴同伦框架为LLMs处理语义等价性问题提供了理论基础，弥补了现有经验性方法的不足。

Abstract: Natural language is replete with superficially different statements, such as
``Charles Darwin wrote" and ``Charles Darwin is the author of", which carry the
same meaning. Large language models (LLMs) should generate the same next-token
probabilities in such cases, but usually do not. Empirical workarounds have
been explored, such as using k-NN estimates of sentence similarity to produce
smoothed estimates. In this paper, we tackle this problem more abstractly,
introducing a categorical homotopy framework for LLMs. We introduce an LLM
Markov category to represent probability distributions in language generated by
an LLM, where the probability of a sentence, such as ``Charles Darwin wrote" is
defined by an arrow in a Markov category. However, this approach runs into
difficulties as language is full of equivalent rephrases, and each generates a
non-isomorphic arrow in the LLM Markov category. To address this fundamental
problem, we use categorical homotopy techniques to capture ``weak equivalences"
in an LLM Markov category. We present a detailed overview of application of
categorical homotopy to LLMs, from higher algebraic K-theory to model
categories, building on powerful theoretical results developed over the past
half a century.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 小语言模型（SLMs）在复杂多变的自然语言中提取核心问题并进行推理的能力有限，阻碍了优化。

Method: 提出DURIT框架，通过三步算法（映射、对齐、训练）在规范问题空间中训练推理策略。

Result: DURIT显著提升了SLMs在数学和逻辑推理任务中的性能，并增强了鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 分离理解与推理是提升SLMs推理能力的有效策略。

Abstract: Despite recent advances in the reasoning capabilities of Large Language
Models (LLMs), improving the reasoning ability of Small Language Models (SLMs,
e.g., $\leq$ 1.5B) remains challenging. A key obstacle lies in the complexity
and variability of natural language: essentially equivalent problems often
appear in diverse surface forms, often obscured by redundant or distracting
details. This imposes a dual burden on SLMs: they must first extract the core
problem from complex linguistic input, and then perform reasoning based on that
understanding. The resulting vast and noisy problem space hinders optimization,
particularly for models with limited capacity. To address this, we propose a
new framework that decouples understanding from reasoning by mapping natural
language problems into a canonical problem space-a semantically simplified yet
expressive domain. This enables SLMs to focus on reasoning over standardized
inputs, free from linguistic variability. Within this framework, we introduce
DURIT (Decoupled Understanding from Reasoning via Iterative Training), a
three-step algorithm that iteratively: (1) mapping natural language problems
via reinforcement learning, (2) aligns reasoning trajectories through
self-distillation, and (3) trains reasoning policies in the problem space. The
mapper and reasoner are co-trained in an alternating loop throughout this
process. Experiments show that DURIT substantially improves SLMs' performance
on both in-domain and out-of-domain mathematical and logical reasoning tasks.
Beyond improving reasoning capabilities, DURIT also improves the robustness of
reasoning, validating decoupling understanding from reasoning as an effective
strategy for strengthening SLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在联邦学习环境中，提升大语言模型的推理能力面临性能、隐私和计算效率的平衡问题，医疗领域尤其需要可解释的推理路径。

Method: 提出FedCoT框架，通过轻量级思维链增强机制和动态选择最优推理路径，结合改进的LoRA模块聚合方法。

Result: 在医疗推理任务中显著提升推理性能，同时完全保护数据隐私。

Conclusion: FedCoT为联邦学习中的高效推理提供了可行方案，特别适合医疗等隐私敏感领域。

Abstract: Efficiently enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models
(LLMs) in federated learning environments remains challenging, particularly
when balancing performance gains with strict computational, communication, and
privacy constraints. This challenge is especially acute in healthcare, where
decisions-spanning clinical, operational, and patient-facing contexts-demand
not only accurate outputs but also interpretable, traceable rationales to
ensure safety, accountability, and regulatory compliance. Conventional
federated tuning approaches on LLM fail to address this need: they optimize
primarily for answer correctness while neglecting rationale quality, leaving
CoT capabilities dependent on models' innate pre-training abilities. Moreover,
existing methods for improving rationales typically rely on privacy-violating
knowledge distillation from centralized models. Additionally, the communication
overhead in traditional federated fine-tuning on LLMs remains substantial. We
addresses this gap by proposing FedCoT, a novel framework specifically designed
to enhance reasoning in federated settings. FedCoT leverages a lightweight
chain-of-thought enhancement mechanism: local models generate multiple
reasoning paths, and a compact discriminator dynamically selects the most
promising one. This approach improves reasoning accuracy and robustness while
providing valuable interpretability, which is particularly critical for medical
applications. To manage client heterogeneity efficiently, we adopt an improved
aggregation approach building upon advanced LoRA module stacking, incorporating
client classifier-awareness to achieve noise-free aggregation across diverse
clients. Comprehensive experiments on medical reasoning tasks demonstrate that
FedCoT significantly boosts client-side reasoning performance under stringent
resource budgets while fully preserving data privacy.

Motivation: 直接使用LLM处理长事件序列计算成本高且不实用，需更高效的方法。

Method: 提出LATTE框架，利用对比学习对齐事件嵌入与LLM语义嵌入，通过短提示生成监督信号。

Result: 实验表明，LATTE在真实金融数据集上优于现有技术，且适用于延迟敏感环境。

Conclusion: LATTE高效且实用，为金融应用提供了一种低成本的事件序列表示学习方法。

Abstract: Learning clients embeddings from sequences of their historic communications
is central to financial applications. While large language models (LLMs) offer
general world knowledge, their direct use on long event sequences is
computationally expensive and impractical in real-world pipelines. In this
paper, we propose LATTE, a contrastive learning framework that aligns raw event
embeddings with semantic embeddings from frozen LLMs. Behavioral features are
summarized into short prompts, embedded by the LLM, and used as supervision via
contrastive loss. The proposed approach significantly reduces inference cost
and input size compared to conventional processing of complete sequence by LLM.
We experimentally show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques
for learning event sequence representations on real-world financial datasets
while remaining deployable in latency-sensitive environments.

Motivation: 大型语言模型在学科问答中应用广泛，但幻觉和非事实生成问题严重影响了其可靠性。共形预测和显著性测试的结合尚未被探索。

Method: 通过自一致性重采样计算选项频率，结合p值和零假设检验构建预测集。

Conclusion: 该研究为高风险问答应用中可信赖的大型语言模型部署提供了统计框架。

Abstract: This study introduces a significance testing-enhanced conformal prediction
(CP) framework to improve trustworthiness of large language models (LLMs) in
multiple-choice question answering (MCQA). While LLMs have been increasingly
deployed in disciplinary QA scenarios, hallucination and nonfactual generation
substantially compromise response reliability. Although CP provides
statistically rigorous marginal coverage guarantees for prediction sets, and
significance testing offers established statistical rigor, their synergistic
integration remains unexplored. To mitigate hallucination and factual
inaccuracies, our framework integrates $p$-value computation with conformity
scoring through self-consistency resampling of MCQA responses. This approach
calculates option frequencies to address LLMs' black-box nature, subsequently
constructing prediction sets via null hypothesis testing ($\mathcal{H}_0$) with
empirically derived $p$-values. Evaluations on MMLU and MMLU-Pro benchmarks
using off-the-shelf LLMs demonstrate: (1) The enhanced CP achieves
user-specified empirical miscoverage rates; (2) Test-set average prediction set
size (APSS) decreases monotonically with increasing risk levels ($\alpha$),
validating APSS as an effective uncertainty metric. This work establishes a
principled statistical framework for trustworthy LLM deployment in high-stakes
QA applications.

Abstract: Among the many challenges mothers undergo after childbirth, postpartum
depression (PPD) is a severe condition that significantly impacts their mental
and physical well-being. Consequently, the rapid detection of ppd and their
associated risk factors is critical for in-time assessment and intervention
through specialized prevention procedures. Accordingly, this work addresses the
need to help practitioners make decisions with the latest technological
advancements to enable real-time screening and treatment recommendations.
Mainly, our work contributes to an intelligent PPD screening system that
combines Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning (ML), and Large Language
Models (LLMs) towards an affordable, real-time, and non-invasive free speech
analysis. Moreover, it addresses the black box problem since the predictions
are described to the end users thanks to the combination of LLMs with
interpretable ml models (i.e., tree-based algorithms) using feature importance
and natural language. The results obtained are 90 % on ppd detection for all
evaluation metrics, outperforming the competing solutions in the literature.
Ultimately, our solution contributes to the rapid detection of PPD and their
associated risk factors, critical for in-time and proper assessment and
intervention.

TL;DR: SABER是一种强化学习框架，通过可切换和平衡的训练方法，使大型语言模型（LLM）能够在用户控制的推理预算下高效运行，支持四种推理模式，显著降低推理成本并保持高准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM在复杂任务中表现出色，但推理成本和延迟过高，需要一种灵活控制推理深度和成本的方法。

Method: SABER通过分析训练样本的推理令牌使用情况，将其分配到预定义的预算层级，并在微调中使用系统提示和长度感知奖励来约束推理长度，同时引入无推理样本确保模型可靠性。

Result: 在数学推理、代码生成和逻辑推理任务中，SABER在严格预算下保持高准确性，其中FastThink模式在MATH基准上推理长度减少65.4%，准确率提升3.6%。

Conclusion: SABER提供了一种高效且灵活的LLM推理框架，能够在不同任务和预算下实现性能和成本的平衡。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) empowered by chain-of-thought reasoning have
achieved impressive accuracy on complex tasks but suffer from excessive
inference costs and latency when applied uniformly to all problems. We propose
SABER (Switchable and Balanced Training for Efficient LLM Reasoning), a
reinforcement learning framework that endows LLMs with user-controllable,
token-budgeted reasoning. SABER first profiles each training example's
base-model thinking token usage and assigns it to one of the predefined budget
tiers. During fine-tuning, the model is guided by system prompts and
length-aware rewards to respect its assigned budget. In parallel, we
incorporate no-think examples to ensure the model remains reliable even when
explicit reasoning is turned off. SABER further supports four discrete
inference modes - NoThink, FastThink, CoreThink, and DeepThink, enabling
flexible trade-offs between latency and reasoning depth. Extensive evaluations
on math reasoning (MATH, GSM8K), code generation (MBPP), and logical reasoning
(LiveBench-Reasoning) demonstrate that SABER achieves high accuracy under tight
budgets, graceful degradation, and effective cross-scale and cross-domain
generalization. In particular, SABER-FastThink cuts reasoning length by 65.4%
and yields a 3.6% accuracy gain compared with the base model on the MATH
benchmark.

Motivation: ADRD在美国影响约500万老年人，但超半数未被诊断。基于语音的自然语言处理（NLP）提供了一种可扩展的早期检测方法。

Method: 开发了一个筛查流程，结合Transformer嵌入与手工特征，测试LLM生成的合成语音数据增强，并评估单模态和多模态LLM分类器。

Result: 融合模型表现最佳（F1=83.3），数据增强后F1提升至85.7。单模态LLM微调后性能显著提升，多模态模型表现较低。

Conclusion: 结合Transformer和手工特征可提升ADRD检测效果，LLM在分类和数据增强中有效，但多模态模型需进一步改进。

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) affect approximately five
million older adults in the U.S., yet over half remain undiagnosed.
Speech-based natural language processing (NLP) offers a promising, scalable
approach to detect early cognitive decline through linguistic markers.
  To develop and evaluate a screening pipeline that (i) fuses transformer
embeddings with handcrafted linguistic features, (ii) tests data augmentation
using synthetic speech generated by large language models (LLMs), and (iii)
benchmarks unimodal and multimodal LLM classifiers for ADRD detection.
  Transcripts from the DementiaBank "cookie-theft" task (n = 237) were used.
Ten transformer models were evaluated under three fine-tuning strategies. A
fusion model combined embeddings from the top-performing transformer with 110
lexical-derived linguistic features. Five LLMs (LLaMA-8B/70B, MedAlpaca-7B,
Ministral-8B, GPT-4o) were fine-tuned to generate label-conditioned synthetic
speech, which was used to augment training data. Three multimodal models
(GPT-4o, Qwen-Omni, Phi-4) were tested for speech-text classification in
zero-shot and fine-tuned settings.
  The fusion model achieved F1 = 83.3 (AUC = 89.5), outperforming linguistic or
transformer-only baselines. Augmenting training data with 2x MedAlpaca-7B
synthetic speech increased F1 to 85.7. Fine-tuning significantly improved
unimodal LLM classifiers (e.g., MedAlpaca: F1 = 47.3 -> 78.5 F1). Current
multimodal models demonstrated lower performance (GPT-4o = 70.2 F1; Qwen =
66.0). Performance gains aligned with the distributional similarity between
synthetic and real speech.
  Integrating transformer embeddings with linguistic features enhances ADRD
detection from speech. Clinically tuned LLMs effectively support both
classification and data augmentation, while further advancement is needed in
multimodal modeling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估方法忽视用户个体差异，需一种兼顾通用质量和个性化对齐的评估框架。

Method: PREF采用三步流程：1）LLM生成通用准则；2）基于用户偏好重排和增强准则；3）LLM评分。

Result: 在PrefEval基准测试中，PREF比基线方法更准确、校准更好，且更贴近人类判断。

Conclusion: PREF为个性化语言生成系统的可靠评估和开发奠定了基础。

Abstract: Personalised text generation is essential for user-centric information
systems, yet most evaluation methods overlook the individuality of users. We
introduce \textbf{PREF}, a \textbf{P}ersonalised \textbf{R}eference-free
\textbf{E}valuation \textbf{F}ramework that jointly measures general output
quality and user-specific alignment without requiring gold personalised
references. PREF operates in a three-step pipeline: (1) a coverage stage uses a
large language model (LLM) to generate a comprehensive, query-specific
guideline covering universal criteria such as factuality, coherence, and
completeness; (2) a preference stage re-ranks and selectively augments these
factors using the target user's profile, stated or inferred preferences, and
context, producing a personalised evaluation rubric; and (3) a scoring stage
applies an LLM judge to rate candidate answers against this rubric, ensuring
baseline adequacy while capturing subjective priorities. This separation of
coverage from preference improves robustness, transparency, and reusability,
and allows smaller models to approximate the personalised quality of larger
ones. Experiments on the PrefEval benchmark, including implicit
preference-following tasks, show that PREF achieves higher accuracy, better
calibration, and closer alignment with human judgments than strong baselines.
By enabling scalable, interpretable, and user-aligned evaluation, PREF lays the
groundwork for more reliable assessment and development of personalised
language generation systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在语言任务中表现出色，但容易受到绕过安全对齐的jailbreak攻击。本文旨在提出一种更有效的攻击方法，并探索防御策略。

Method: LFJ通过选择主题和语法相似的查询对，在关键层和令牌上进行梯度引导插值，并通过优化平衡攻击成功率和计算效率。

Result: 在Vicuna和LLaMA-2等模型上，LFJ的平均攻击成功率为94.01%，优于现有方法。提出的对抗训练防御方法可将攻击成功率降低80%以上。

Conclusion: LFJ是一种高效的语言模型攻击方法，其成功依赖于查询对选择和隐藏状态插值。对抗训练是有效的防御手段。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive capabilities in various
language tasks but are susceptible to jailbreak attacks that circumvent their
safety alignments. This paper introduces Latent Fusion Jailbreak (LFJ), a
representation-based attack that interpolates hidden states from harmful and
benign query pairs to elicit prohibited responses. LFJ begins by selecting
query pairs with high thematic and syntactic similarity, then performs
gradient-guided interpolation at influential layers and tokens, followed by
optimization to balance attack success, output fluency, and computational
efficiency. Evaluations on models such as Vicuna and LLaMA-2 across benchmarks
like AdvBench and MaliciousInstruct yield an average attack success rate (ASR)
of 94.01%, outperforming existing methods. To mitigate LFJ, we propose an
adversarial training defense that fine-tunes models on interpolated examples,
reducing ASR by over 80% without degrading performance on benign inputs.
Ablation studies validate the importance of query pair selection, hidden state
interpolation components, and optimization strategies in LFJ's effectiveness.

strategies such as Best-of-N Sampling and Majority Voting have also proven to
enhance alignment and performance by trading off computation. However, existing
prompt optimization approaches are inference strategy agnostic; that is, they
optimize prompts without regard to the inference strategy employed during
deployment. This constitutes a significant methodological gap, as our empirical
and theoretical analysis reveals a strong interdependence between these two
paradigms. Moreover, we find that user preferences regarding trade-offs among
multiple objectives and inference budgets substantially influence the choice of
prompt and inference configuration. To address this gap, we introduce a unified
novel framework named IAPO (Inference-Aware Prompt Optimization) that jointly
optimizes the prompt and inference scale, while being aware of the inference
budget and different task objectives. We then develop a fixed-budget training
algorithm for IAPO, which we call PSST (Prompt Scaling via Sequential
Trimming), and analyze finite-budget guarantees on error probability. Finally,
we evaluate the effectiveness of PSST on six different tasks, including
multi-objective text generation and reasoning, and demonstrate the critical
role of incorporating inference-awareness when aligning black-box LLMs through
prompt optimization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 揭示LLMs思考模式在越狱攻击中的脆弱性，并提出解决方案。

Method: 通过添加特定思考标记显式引导LLMs内部思考过程。

Result: 安全思考干预显著降低了思考模式下的攻击成功率。

Conclusion: 安全思考干预是缓解LLMs思考模式脆弱性的有效方法。

Abstract: Thinking mode has always been regarded as one of the most valuable modes in
LLMs. However, we uncover a surprising and previously overlooked phenomenon:
LLMs with thinking mode are more easily broken by Jailbreak attack. We evaluate
9 LLMs on AdvBench and HarmBench and find that the success rate of attacking
thinking mode in LLMs is almost higher than that of non-thinking mode. Through
large numbers of sample studies, it is found that for educational purposes and
excessively long thinking lengths are the characteristics of successfully
attacked data, and LLMs also give harmful answers when they mostly know that
the questions are harmful. In order to alleviate the above problems, this paper
proposes a method of safe thinking intervention for LLMs, which explicitly
guides the internal thinking processes of LLMs by adding "specific thinking
tokens" of LLMs to the prompt. The results demonstrate that the safe thinking
intervention can significantly reduce the attack success rate of LLMs with
thinking mode.

Result: 实验显示当前LLM在复杂多语言常识推理任务中表现不佳。

Conclusion: mSCoRe揭示了LLM的局限性，为未来改进提供了方向。

Abstract: Recent advancements in reasoning-reinforced Large Language Models (LLMs) have
shown remarkable capabilities in complex reasoning tasks. However, the
mechanism underlying their utilization of different human reasoning skills
remains poorly investigated, especially for multilingual commonsense reasoning
that involves everyday knowledge across different languages and cultures. To
address this gap, we propose a \textbf{M}ultilingual and Scalable Benchmark for
\textbf{S}kill-based \textbf{Co}mmonsense \textbf{Re}asoning (\textbf{mSCoRe}).
Our benchmark incorporates three key components that are designed to
systematically evaluate LLM's reasoning capabilities, including: (1) a novel
taxonomy of reasoning skills that enables fine-grained analysis of models'
reasoning processes, (2) a robust data synthesis pipeline tailored specifically
for commonsense reasoning evaluation, and (3) a complexity scaling framework
allowing task difficulty to scale dynamically alongside future improvements in
LLM abilities. Extensive experiments on eights state-of-the-art LLMs of varying
sizes and training approaches demonstrate that \textbf{mSCoRe} remains
significantly challenging for current models, particularly at higher complexity
levels. Our results reveal the limitations of such reasoning-reinforced models
when confronted with nuanced multilingual general and cultural commonsense. We
further provide detailed analysis on the models' reasoning processes,
suggesting future directions for improving multilingual commonsense reasoning
capabilities.

Motivation: 现实场景中，大型语言模型在复杂交互任务中表现不佳，需要开发能够处理多轮对话和推理的模型。

Method: 引入了一套多轮任务基准测试，每个任务测试特定能力，并采用确定性评分机制。

Result: 评估显示当前模型在指令遵循、推理和规划方面存在显著不足。

Conclusion: 该基准为未来研究提供了改进模型在复杂交互任务中表现的方向。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at solving problems with clear and
complete statements, but often struggle with nuanced environments or
interactive tasks which are common in most real-world scenarios. This
highlights the critical need for developing LLMs that can effectively engage in
logically consistent multi-turn dialogue, seek information and reason with
incomplete data. To this end, we introduce a novel benchmark comprising a suite
of multi-turn tasks each designed to test specific reasoning, interactive
dialogue, and information-seeking abilities. These tasks have deterministic
scoring mechanisms, thus eliminating the need for human intervention.
Evaluating frontier models on our benchmark reveals significant headroom. Our
analysis shows that most errors emerge from poor instruction following,
reasoning failures, and poor planning. This benchmark provides valuable
insights into the strengths and weaknesses of current LLMs in handling complex,
interactive scenarios and offers a robust platform for future research aimed at
improving these critical capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在领域特定任务中，由于标注数据稀缺且专家评估成本高，传统LaaJ方法面临挑战，需要一种系统化的元评估方法。

Method: LaaJMeter通过生成合成数据模拟虚拟模型和评估者，系统分析评估指标在真实条件下的表现。

Result: 实验表明，不同指标对评估者质量的敏感性差异显著，凸显了指标选择的重要性。

Conclusion: LaaJMeter为低资源环境中的LaaJ评估提供了可扩展的解决方案，有助于提升NLP评估的可信度和可重复性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used as evaluators in natural
language processing tasks, a paradigm known as LLM-as-a-Judge (LaaJ). While
effective in general domains, LaaJs pose significant challenges in
domain-specific contexts, where annotated data is scarce and expert evaluation
is costly. In such cases, meta-evaluation is often performed using metrics that
have not been validated for the specific domain in which they are applied. As a
result, it becomes difficult to determine which metrics effectively identify
LaaJ quality, and further, what threshold indicates sufficient evaluator
performance. In this work, we introduce LaaJMeter, a simulation-based framework
for controlled meta-evaluation of LaaJs. LaaJMeter enables engineers to
generate synthetic data representing virtual models and judges, allowing
systematic analysis of evaluation metrics under realistic conditions. This
helps practitioners validate and refine LaaJs for specific evaluation tasks:
they can test whether their metrics correctly distinguish between better and
worse (virtual) LaaJs, and estimate appropriate thresholds for evaluator
adequacy.
  We demonstrate the utility of LaaJMeter in a code translation task involving
a legacy programming language, showing how different metrics vary in
sensitivity to evaluator quality. Our results highlight the limitations of
common metrics and the importance of principled metric selection. LaaJMeter
provides a scalable and extensible solution for assessing LaaJs in low-resource
settings, contributing to the broader effort to ensure trustworthy and
reproducible evaluation in NLP.

Motivation: 当前机器翻译质量接近完美，难以区分模型优劣和发现改进方向，因此需要自动识别翻译困难的文本。

Method: 定义了翻译难度任务，引入新评估指标，比较了启发式方法和LLM方法，提出了专用模型Sentinel-src。

Result: 专用模型Sentinel-src优于启发式方法和LLM方法，并发布了两个改进模型Sentinel-src-24和Sentinel-src-25。

Conclusion: 翻译难度估计任务有助于构建更具挑战性的基准，推动机器翻译研究的进一步发展。

Abstract: Machine translation quality has began achieving near-perfect translations in
some setups. These high-quality outputs make it difficult to distinguish
between state-of-the-art models and to identify areas for future improvement.
Automatically identifying texts where machine translation systems struggle
holds promise for developing more discriminative evaluations and guiding future
research.
  We formalize the task of translation difficulty estimation, defining a text's
difficulty based on the expected quality of its translations. We introduce a
new metric to evaluate difficulty estimators and use it to assess both
baselines and novel approaches. Finally, we demonstrate the practical utility
of difficulty estimators by using them to construct more challenging machine
translation benchmarks. Our results show that dedicated models (dubbed
Sentinel-src) outperform both heuristic-based methods (e.g. word rarity or
syntactic complexity) and LLM-as-a-judge approaches. We release two improved
models for difficulty estimation, Sentinel-src-24 and Sentinel-src-25, which
can be used to scan large collections of texts and select those most likely to
challenge contemporary machine translation systems.

Motivation: 提升大型语言模型和视觉语言模型的透明度和可解释性，解决现有方法计算成本高的问题。

Result: For-Value在识别重要微调样本和检测错误标签数据方面表现优异，与基于梯度的方法相当或更好。

Conclusion: For-Value为大规模模型提供了一种高效且可扩展的数据影响力评估方法。

Abstract: Quantifying the influence of individual training samples is essential for
enhancing the transparency and accountability of large language models (LLMs)
and vision-language models (VLMs). However, existing data valuation methods
often rely on Hessian information or model retraining, making them
computationally prohibitive for billion-parameter models. In this work, we
introduce For-Value, a forward-only data valuation framework that enables
scalable and efficient influence estimation for both LLMs and VLMs. By
leveraging the rich representations of modern foundation models, For-Value
computes influence scores using a simple closed-form expression based solely on
a single forward pass, thereby eliminating the need for costly gradient
computations. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that For-Value accurately
estimates per-sample influence by capturing alignment in hidden representations
and prediction errors between training and validation samples. Extensive
experiments show that For-Value matches or outperforms gradient-based baselines
in identifying impactful fine-tuning examples and effectively detecting
mislabeled data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLMs的训练和评估主要基于西方数据，忽视了低资源语言和区域背景的公平性。PakBBQ旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 构建PakBBQ数据集，包含214个模板和17180个QA对，涵盖8个偏见维度。评估多语言LLMs在模糊和明确上下文中的表现。

Result: 实验发现：(1)明确上下文提示提高12%准确率；(2)乌尔都语的抗偏见能力优于英语；(3)负向问题框架减少刻板回答。

Conclusion: 上下文化基准和简单提示工程策略对低资源环境中的偏见缓解至关重要。

Abstract: With the widespread adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) across various
applications, it is empirical to ensure their fairness across all user
communities. However, most LLMs are trained and evaluated on Western centric
data, with little attention paid to low-resource languages and regional
contexts. To address this gap, we introduce PakBBQ, a culturally and regionally
adapted extension of the original Bias Benchmark for Question Answering (BBQ)
dataset. PakBBQ comprises over 214 templates, 17180 QA pairs across 8
categories in both English and Urdu, covering eight bias dimensions including
age, disability, appearance, gender, socio-economic status, religious, regional
affiliation, and language formality that are relevant in Pakistan. We evaluate
multiple multilingual LLMs under both ambiguous and explicitly disambiguated
contexts, as well as negative versus non negative question framings. Our
experiments reveal (i) an average accuracy gain of 12\% with disambiguation,
(ii) consistently stronger counter bias behaviors in Urdu than in English, and
(iii) marked framing effects that reduce stereotypical responses when questions
are posed negatively. These findings highlight the importance of contextualized
benchmarks and simple prompt engineering strategies for bias mitigation in low
resource settings.

Motivation: 解决LLM生成非事实或语义不忠实文本的问题，尤其是“幻觉”现象。

Method: 使用联合聚类和主题共现热图，结合信息论指标（如Jensen-Shannon散度和Wasserstein距离）量化语义偏离。

Result: 提出了$\mathcal{S}_H$分数和KL散度指标，用于分类LLM响应类型，并识别危险的“自信虚构”。

Conclusion: SDM框架能有效检测LLM的幻觉现象，为生成文本的可靠性提供诊断工具。

Abstract: The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) is challenged by
hallucinations, critical failure modes where models generate non-factual,
nonsensical or unfaithful text. This paper introduces Semantic Divergence
Metrics (SDM), a novel lightweight framework for detecting Faithfulness
Hallucinations -- events of severe deviations of LLMs responses from input
contexts. We focus on a specific implementation of these LLM errors,
{confabulations, defined as responses that are arbitrary and semantically
misaligned with the user's query. Existing methods like Semantic Entropy test
for arbitrariness by measuring the diversity of answers to a single, fixed
prompt. Our SDM framework improves upon this by being more prompt-aware: we
test for a deeper form of arbitrariness by measuring response consistency not
only across multiple answers but also across multiple, semantically-equivalent
paraphrases of the original prompt. Methodologically, our approach uses joint
clustering on sentence embeddings to create a shared topic space for prompts
and answers. A heatmap of topic co-occurances between prompts and responses can
be viewed as a quantified two-dimensional visualization of the user-machine
dialogue. We then compute a suite of information-theoretic metrics to measure
the semantic divergence between prompts and responses. Our practical score,
$\mathcal{S}_H$, combines the Jensen-Shannon divergence and Wasserstein
distance to quantify this divergence, with a high score indicating a
Faithfulness hallucination. Furthermore, we identify the KL divergence
KL(Answer $||$ Prompt) as a powerful indicator of \textbf{Semantic
Exploration}, a key signal for distinguishing different generative behaviors.
These metrics are further combined into the Semantic Box, a diagnostic
framework for classifying LLM response types, including the dangerous,
confident confabulation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: BPRS评分需要长时间结构化访谈，临床实践中不常用，LLMs可简化评估过程。

Method: 使用LLMs分析409名CHR患者的访谈记录，预测BPRS评分，包括零样本学习和跨语言评估。

Result: LLM预测与真实评估的吻合度高（中位数一致性0.84，ICC 0.73），跨语言评估效果更佳（中位数一致性0.88）。

Conclusion: LLMs在标准化CHR患者评估方面潜力巨大，尤其在跨语言和纵向信息整合中表现优异。

Abstract: Patients who are at clinical high risk (CHR) for schizophrenia need close
monitoring of their symptoms to inform appropriate treatments. The Brief
Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) is a validated, commonly used research tool for
measuring symptoms in patients with schizophrenia and other psychotic
disorders; however, it is not commonly used in clinical practice as it requires
a lengthy structured interview. Here, we utilize large language models (LLMs)
to predict BPRS scores from clinical interview transcripts in 409 CHR patients
from the Accelerating Medicines Partnership Schizophrenia (AMP-SCZ) cohort.
Despite the interviews not being specifically structured to measure the BPRS,
the zero-shot performance of the LLM predictions compared to the true
assessment (median concordance: 0.84, ICC: 0.73) approaches human inter- and
intra-rater reliability. We further demonstrate that LLMs have substantial
potential to improve and standardize the assessment of CHR patients via their
accuracy in assessing the BPRS in foreign languages (median concordance: 0.88,
ICC: 0.70), and integrating longitudinal information in a one-shot or few-shot
learning approach.

Motivation: 研究发现LLM对提示词微小变化敏感，部分源于其内在的归纳偏置。利用LLM输出优化提示词，可更高效地匹配模型偏置。

Method: 提出归纳偏置提取与匹配策略，将LLM输出作为提示词的一部分，以生成更符合模型偏置的提示。

Result: 实验表明，该策略使分类任务的Likert评分提升19%，排序任务提升27%。

Conclusion: 通过匹配LLM的归纳偏置，能显著提升提示词效果，为提示工程提供新思路。

Abstract: The active research topic of prompt engineering makes it evident that LLMs
are sensitive to small changes in prompt wording. A portion of this can be
ascribed to the inductive bias that is present in the LLM. By using an LLM's
output as a portion of its prompt, we can more easily create satisfactory
wording for prompts. This has the effect of creating a prompt that matches the
inductive bias in model. Empirically, we show that using this Inductive Bias
Extraction and Matching strategy improves LLM Likert ratings used for
classification by up to 19% and LLM Likert ratings used for ranking by up to
27%.

Conclusion: 需采用批判性、跨学科方法设计AI，以解决LLM如何反映和延续不平等。

Abstract: With the advance of Artificial Intelligence (AI), Large Language Models
(LLMs) have gained prominence and been applied in diverse contexts. As they
evolve into more sophisticated versions, it is essential to assess whether they
reproduce biases, such as discrimination and racialization, while maintaining
hegemonic discourses. Current bias detection approaches rely mostly on
quantitative, automated methods, which often overlook the nuanced ways in which
biases emerge in natural language. This study proposes a qualitative,
discursive framework to complement such methods. Through manual analysis of
LLM-generated short stories featuring Black and white women, we investigate
gender and racial biases. We contend that qualitative methods such as the one
proposed here are fundamental to help both developers and users identify the
precise ways in which biases manifest in LLM outputs, thus enabling better
conditions to mitigate them. Results show that Black women are portrayed as
tied to ancestry and resistance, while white women appear in self-discovery
processes. These patterns reflect how language models replicate crystalized
discursive representations, reinforcing essentialization and a sense of social
immobility. When prompted to correct biases, models offered superficial
revisions that maintained problematic meanings, revealing limitations in
fostering inclusive narratives. Our results demonstrate the ideological
functioning of algorithms and have significant implications for the ethical use
and development of AI. The study reinforces the need for critical,
interdisciplinary approaches to AI design and deployment, addressing how
LLM-generated discourses reflect and perpetuate inequalities.

Abstract: Peer review is essential for scientific progress but faces growing challenges
due to increasing submission volumes and reviewer fatigue. Existing automated
review approaches struggle with factual accuracy, rating consistency, and
analytical depth, often generating superficial or generic feedback lacking the
insights characteristic of high-quality human reviews. We introduce ReviewRL, a
reinforcement learning framework for generating comprehensive and factually

retrieval-augmented context generation pipeline that incorporates relevant
scientific literature, (2) supervised fine-tuning that establishes foundational
reviewing capabilities, and (3) a reinforcement learning procedure with a
composite reward function that jointly enhances review quality and rating
accuracy. Experiments on ICLR 2025 papers demonstrate that ReviewRL
significantly outperforms existing methods across both rule-based metrics and
model-based quality assessments. ReviewRL establishes a foundational framework
for RL-driven automatic critique generation in scientific discovery,
demonstrating promising potential for future development in this domain. The
implementation of ReviewRL will be released at GitHub.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究缺乏对表格及其上下文的深度语义解析，限制了跨段落数据解释和上下文一致性分析。

Method: DOTABLER利用定制数据集和预训练模型微调，构建完整的解析流程，识别与表格语义关联的上下文片段。

Result: 在真实PDF数据集上，DOTABLER的精确率和F1分数超过90%，优于GPT-4o等先进模型。

Conclusion: DOTABLER在表格语义分析和深度文档解析方面表现出色，为高级任务提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Documents are core carriers of information and knowl-edge, with broad
applications in finance, healthcare, and scientific research. Tables, as the
main medium for structured data, encapsulate key information and are among the
most critical document components. Existing studies largely focus on
surface-level tasks such as layout analysis, table detection, and data
extraction, lacking deep semantic parsing of tables and their contextual
associations. This limits advanced tasks like cross-paragraph data
interpretation and context-consistent analysis. To address this, we propose
DOTABLER, a table-centric semantic document parsing framework designed to
uncover deep semantic links between tables and their context. DOTABLER
leverages a custom dataset and domain-specific fine-tuning of pre-trained
models, integrating a complete parsing pipeline to identify context segments
semantically tied to tables. Built on this semantic understanding, DOTABLER
implements two core functionalities: table-centric document structure parsing
and domain-specific table retrieval, delivering comprehensive table-anchored
semantic analysis and precise extraction of semantically relevant tables.
Evaluated on nearly 4,000 pages with over 1,000 tables from real-world PDFs,
DOTABLER achieves over 90% Precision and F1 scores, demonstrating superior
performance in table-context semantic analysis and deep document parsing
compared to advanced models such as GPT-4o.

TL;DR: FreLLM4Rec通过频谱视角平衡语义和协作信息，解决了LLM推荐系统中协作信号衰减的问题，性能提升显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM推荐系统过度依赖语义关联，导致协作信号在传播过程中衰减，影响推荐性能。

Method: 提出FreLLM4Rec方法，结合全局图低通滤波（G-LPF）和时频调制（TFM）来保留协作信号。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上，FreLLM4Rec性能提升高达8.00%（NDCG@10），优于基线方法。

Conclusion: FreLLM4Rec为LLM推荐系统提供了协作信号处理的新思路，并验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Recommender systems in concert with Large Language Models (LLMs) present
promising avenues for generating semantically-informed recommendations.
However, LLM-based recommenders exhibit a tendency to overemphasize semantic
correlations within users' interaction history. When taking pretrained
collaborative ID embeddings as input, LLM-based recommenders progressively
weaken the inherent collaborative signals as the embeddings propagate through
LLM backbones layer by layer, as opposed to traditional Transformer-based
sequential models in which collaborative signals are typically preserved or
even enhanced for state-of-the-art performance. To address this limitation, we
introduce FreLLM4Rec, an approach designed to balance semantic and
collaborative information from a spectral perspective. Item embeddings that
incorporate both semantic and collaborative information are first purified
using a Global Graph Low-Pass Filter (G-LPF) to preliminarily remove irrelevant
high-frequency noise. Temporal Frequency Modulation (TFM) then actively
preserves collaborative signal layer by layer. Note that the collaborative
preservation capability of TFM is theoretically guaranteed by establishing a
connection between the optimal but hard-to-implement local graph fourier
filters and the suboptimal yet computationally efficient frequency-domain

*Beso Mikaberidze,Teimuraz Saghinadze,Simon Ostermann,Philipp Muller*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种跨语言提示编码器（XPE）和双软提示机制，用于提升低性能语言在多语言任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索提示编码器在跨语言任务中的潜力，特别是对低性能语言的改进。

Method: 结合轻量级编码架构和多语言训练设计XPE，并引入双软提示机制。

Result: XPE对低性能语言效果显著，混合设计在多语言场景中适应性更强。

Conclusion: XPE和双软提示机制为跨语言任务提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Soft prompts have emerged as a powerful alternative to adapters in
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), enabling large language models (LLMs)
to adapt to downstream tasks without architectural changes or parameter
updates. While prior work has focused on stabilizing training via parameter
interaction in small neural prompt encoders, their broader potential for
transfer across languages remains unexplored. In this paper, we demonstrate
that a prompt encoder can play a central role in improving performance on
low-performing languages-those that achieve poor accuracy even under full-model
fine-tuning. We introduce the Cross-Prompt Encoder (XPE), which combines a
lightweight encoding architecture with multi-source training on typologically
diverse languages - a design that enables the model to capture abstract and
transferable patterns across languages. To complement XPE, we propose a Dual
Soft Prompt mechanism that combines an encoder-based prompt with a directly
trained standard soft prompt. This hybrid design proves especially effective
for target languages that benefit from both broadly shared structure and
language-specific alignment. Experiments on the SIB-200 benchmark reveal a
consistent trade-off: XPE is most effective for low-performing languages, while
hybrid variants offer broader adaptability across multilingual settings.

*Jungyup Lee,Jemin Kim,Sang Park,SeungJae Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种两阶段微调方法，使大语言模型Qwen3 14B能自然地用韩语思考。第一阶段通过监督微调（SFT）提升韩语逻辑推理能力，第二阶段使用强化学习（GRPO）进一步优化推理和问题解决性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型在韩语推理任务中的性能不足问题，并提升其整体推理能力。

Method: 第一阶段：监督微调（SFT）在高质量韩语推理数据集上；第二阶段：使用GRPO算法进行强化学习，引入oracle judge模型解决训练稳定性问题。

Result: 模型在韩语推理任务中表现显著提升，同时在数学和编程任务中也有进步，且能完全用韩语进行内部思维链。

Conclusion: 两阶段微调方法有效提升了模型在韩语推理任务中的性能，同时解决了GRPO训练中的稳定性问题。

Abstract: We present a two-stage fine-tuning approach to make the large language model
Qwen3 14B "think" natively in Korean. In the first stage, supervised
fine-tuning (SFT) on a high-quality Korean reasoning dataset establishes a
strong foundation in Korean logical reasoning, yielding notable improvements in
Korean-language tasks and even some gains in general reasoning ability. In the
second stage, we employ reinforcement learning with a customized Group Relative
Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm to further enhance both Korean reasoning
alignment and overall problem-solving performance. We address critical
stability challenges in GRPO training - such as reward hacking and policy
collapse - by introducing an oracle judge model that calibrates the reward
signal. Our approach achieves stable learning (avoiding the collapse observed
in naive GRPO) and leads to steady, incremental performance gains. The final
RL-tuned model demonstrates substantially improved results on advanced
reasoning benchmarks (particularly math and coding tasks) while maintaining
knowledge and language proficiency, successfully conducting its internal
chain-of-thought entirely in Korean.

Result: 性能提升10%，能处理更复杂任务，且优于英语中心的大型语言模型。

Conclusion: 该方法为跨语言ABSA提供了高效实用的解决方案，尤其在低资源语言中表现突出。

Abstract: Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) has made significant strides, yet
challenges remain for low-resource languages due to the predominant focus on
English. Current cross-lingual ABSA studies often centre on simpler tasks and
rely heavily on external translation tools. In this paper, we present a novel
sequence-to-sequence method for compound ABSA tasks that eliminates the need
for such tools. Our approach, which uses constrained decoding, improves
cross-lingual ABSA performance by up to 10\%. This method broadens the scope of
cross-lingual ABSA, enabling it to handle more complex tasks and providing a
practical, efficient alternative to translation-dependent techniques.
Furthermore, we compare our approach with large language models (LLMs) and show
that while fine-tuned multilingual LLMs can achieve comparable results,
English-centric LLMs struggle with these tasks.

Conclusion: 这些成果为捷克语文本摘要研究提供了新方向，尤其在历史文档处理领域具有潜力。

Abstract: Text summarization is the task of shortening a larger body of text into a
concise version while retaining its essential meaning and key information.
While summarization has been significantly explored in English and other
high-resource languages, Czech text summarization, particularly for historical
documents, remains underexplored due to linguistic complexities and a scarcity
of annotated datasets. Large language models such as Mistral and mT5 have
demonstrated excellent results on many natural language processing tasks and
languages. Therefore, we employ these models for Czech summarization, resulting
in two key contributions: (1) achieving new state-of-the-art results on the
modern Czech summarization dataset SumeCzech using these advanced models, and
(2) introducing a novel dataset called Posel od \v{C}erchova for summarization
of historical Czech documents with baseline results. Together, these
contributions provide a great potential for advancing Czech text summarization
and open new avenues for research in Czech historical text processing.

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升跨语言ABSA性能，为实际应用提供实用建议，并推动该领域的研究进展。

Abstract: While aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) has made substantial progress,
challenges remain for low-resource languages, which are often overlooked in
favour of English. Current cross-lingual ABSA approaches focus on limited, less
complex tasks and often rely on external translation tools. This paper
introduces a novel approach using constrained decoding with
sequence-to-sequence models, eliminating the need for unreliable translation
tools and improving cross-lingual performance by 5\% on average for the most
complex task. The proposed method also supports multi-tasking, which enables
solving multiple ABSA tasks with a single model, with constrained decoding
boosting results by more than 10\%.
  We evaluate our approach across seven languages and six ABSA tasks,
surpassing state-of-the-art methods and setting new benchmarks for previously
unexplored tasks. Additionally, we assess large language models (LLMs) in
zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuning scenarios. While LLMs perform poorly in
zero-shot and few-shot settings, fine-tuning achieves competitive results
compared to smaller multilingual models, albeit at the cost of longer training
and inference times.
  We provide practical recommendations for real-world applications, enhancing
the understanding of cross-lingual ABSA methodologies. This study offers
valuable insights into the strengths and limitations of cross-lingual ABSA
approaches, advancing the state-of-the-art in this challenging research domain.

Motivation: 现有恶意内容检测方法依赖人工或LLM，效率或准确性不足，需平衡两者。

Method: 提出MDH框架，结合LLM标注和少量人工监督，应用于数据集清理和越狱响应检测。

Result: 发现精心设计的开发者消息能显著提升越狱成功率，提出了D-Attack和DH-CoT两种新策略。

Conclusion: MDH框架在准确性和效率间取得平衡，新策略提升了攻击效果，相关资源将开源。

Abstract: Evaluating jailbreak attacks is challenging when prompts are not overtly
harmful or fail to induce harmful outputs. Unfortunately, many existing
red-teaming datasets contain such unsuitable prompts. To evaluate attacks
accurately, these datasets need to be assessed and cleaned for maliciousness.
However, existing malicious content detection methods rely on either manual
annotation, which is labor-intensive, or large language models (LLMs), which
have inconsistent accuracy in harmful types. To balance accuracy and
efficiency, we propose a hybrid evaluation framework named MDH (Malicious
content Detection based on LLMs with Human assistance) that combines LLM-based
annotation with minimal human oversight, and apply it to dataset cleaning and
detection of jailbroken responses. Furthermore, we find that well-crafted
developer messages can significantly boost jailbreak success, leading us to
propose two new strategies: D-Attack, which leverages context simulation, and
DH-CoT, which incorporates hijacked chains of thought. The Codes, datasets,
judgements, and detection results will be released in github repository:

Motivation: 随着NLP和大型语言模型（LLMs）的快速发展，生成对抗性示例以突破LLMs的防御成为理解模型漏洞和提升鲁棒性的关键挑战。

Method: 利用稀疏自编码器（SAE）重构隐藏层表示，对高激活特征进行选择性扰动，生成保留恶意意图但增强安全信号的对抗性文本。

Result: 实验表明，SFPF生成的对抗性文本能绕过现有先进防御机制，揭示了当前NLP系统的持续漏洞。

Conclusion: 该方法为红队策略提供了新思路，但其有效性因提示和层而异，对其他架构和大模型的通用性仍需验证。

Abstract: With the rapid proliferation of Natural Language Processing (NLP), especially
Large Language Models (LLMs), generating adversarial examples to jailbreak LLMs
remains a key challenge for understanding model vulnerabilities and improving
robustness. In this context, we propose a new black-box attack method that
leverages the interpretability of large models. We introduce the Sparse Feature
Perturbation Framework (SFPF), a novel approach for adversarial text generation
that utilizes sparse autoencoders to identify and manipulate critical features
in text. After using the SAE model to reconstruct hidden layer representations,
we perform feature clustering on the successfully attacked texts to identify
features with higher activations. These highly activated features are then
perturbed to generate new adversarial texts. This selective perturbation
preserves the malicious intent while amplifying safety signals, thereby
increasing their potential to evade existing defenses. Our method enables a new
red-teaming strategy that balances adversarial effectiveness with safety
alignment. Experimental results demonstrate that adversarial texts generated by
SFPF can bypass state-of-the-art defense mechanisms, revealing persistent
vulnerabilities in current NLP systems.However, the method's effectiveness
varies across prompts and layers, and its generalizability to other
architectures and larger models remains to be validated.

Result: 在四个长文本基准测试中，ComoRAG相对最强基线提升11%，尤其擅长全局理解任务。

Conclusion: ComoRAG为长文本理解提供了一种基于认知启发的动态推理范式，代码已开源。

Abstract: Narrative comprehension on long stories and novels has been a challenging
domain attributed to their intricate plotlines and entangled, often evolving
relations among characters and entities. Given the LLM's diminished reasoning
over extended context and high computational cost, retrieval-based approaches
remain a pivotal role in practice. However, traditional RAG methods can fall
short due to their stateless, single-step retrieval process, which often
overlooks the dynamic nature of capturing interconnected relations within
long-range context. In this work, we propose ComoRAG, holding the principle
that narrative reasoning is not a one-shot process, but a dynamic, evolving
interplay between new evidence acquisition and past knowledge consolidation,
analogous to human cognition when reasoning with memory-related signals in the
brain. Specifically, when encountering a reasoning impasse, ComoRAG undergoes
iterative reasoning cycles while interacting with a dynamic memory workspace.
In each cycle, it generates probing queries to devise new exploratory paths,
then integrates the retrieved evidence of new aspects into a global memory
pool, thereby supporting the emergence of a coherent context for the query
resolution. Across four challenging long-context narrative benchmarks (200K+
tokens), ComoRAG outperforms strong RAG baselines with consistent relative
gains up to 11% compared to the strongest baseline. Further analysis reveals
that ComoRAG is particularly advantageous for complex queries requiring global
comprehension, offering a principled, cognitively motivated paradigm for
retrieval-based long context comprehension towards stateful reasoning. Our code

TL;DR: 本文介绍了IdiomEval框架，用于评估中文成语翻译质量，发现现有翻译系统（如GPT-4和Google Translate）在成语翻译上表现不佳，错误率高达28%。同时，现有评估指标与人工评分的相关性较低（Pearson<0.48），作者提出了改进模型，F1分数达到0.68。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 中文成语的翻译在机器翻译中研究较少，但其重要性高，尤其是成语的比喻意义与字面意义差异大，现有翻译系统表现不佳。

Method: 提出IdiomEval框架，标注了900个翻译对（来自9个系统，包括GPT-4和Google Translate），涵盖四个领域，并开发改进模型。

Result: 现有翻译系统在成语翻译上错误率高（如GPT-4错误率28%），现有评估指标与人工评分相关性低（Pearson<0.48）。改进模型的F1分数为0.68。

Conclusion: 中文成语翻译仍具挑战性，现有系统和评估指标需改进，IdiomEval框架及改进模型为未来研究提供了方向。

Abstract: Idioms, whose figurative meanings usually differ from their literal
interpretations, are common in everyday language, especially in Chinese, where
they often contain historical references and follow specific structural
patterns. Despite recent progress in machine translation with large language
models, little is known about Chinese idiom translation. In this work, we
introduce IdiomEval, a framework with a comprehensive error taxonomy for
Chinese idiom translation. We annotate 900 translation pairs from nine modern
systems, including GPT-4o and Google Translate, across four domains: web, news,
Wikipedia, and social media. We find these systems fail at idiom translation,
producing incorrect, literal, partial, or even missing translations. The
best-performing system, GPT-4, makes errors in 28% of cases. We also find that
existing evaluation metrics measure idiom quality poorly with Pearson
correlation below 0.48 with human ratings. We thus develop improved models that
achieve F$_1$ scores of 0.68 for detecting idiom translation errors.

Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）的计算成本高昂，限制了其应用。研究旨在通过经济学原理优化资源分配，提高效率。

Method: 提出激励驱动的训练范式，在任务损失中加入可微分的计算成本项，鼓励稀疏和高效的激活。

Result: 在GLUE和WikiText-103任务上，该方法显著降低FLOPS（约40%）和延迟，同时保持准确性，并生成更可解释的注意力模式。

Conclusion: 经济学原理为资源受限下设计高效、自适应且透明的LLM提供了理论基础。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are limited by substantial computational cost.
We introduce a "computational economics" framework that treats an LLM as an
internal economy of resource-constrained agents (attention heads and neuron
blocks) that must allocate scarce computation to maximize task utility. First,
we show empirically that when computation is scarce, standard LLMs reallocate
attention toward high-value tokens while preserving accuracy. Building on this
observation, we propose an incentive-driven training paradigm that augments the
task loss with a differentiable computation cost term, encouraging sparse and
efficient activations. On GLUE (MNLI, STS-B, CoLA) and WikiText-103, the method
yields a family of models that trace a Pareto frontier and consistently
dominate post-hoc pruning; for a similar accuracy we obtain roughly a forty
percent reduction in FLOPS and lower latency, together with more interpretable
attention patterns. These results indicate that economic principles offer a
principled route to designing efficient, adaptive, and more transparent LLMs
under strict resource constraints.

Result: 在四个基准测试中，DiFaR比基线方法提升5.9%，并可将现有检测器性能提升8.7%。

Conclusion: DiFaR显著提升了文本解释的质量，在多模态虚假信息检测中表现出色。

Abstract: Generating textual rationales from large vision-language models (LVLMs) to
support trainable multimodal misinformation detectors has emerged as a
promising paradigm. However, its effectiveness is fundamentally limited by
three core challenges: (i) insufficient diversity in generated rationales, (ii)
factual inaccuracies due to hallucinations, and (iii) irrelevant or conflicting
content that introduces noise. We introduce DiFaR, a detector-agnostic
framework that produces diverse, factual, and relevant rationales to enhance
misinformation detection. DiFaR employs five chain-of-thought prompts to elicit
varied reasoning traces from LVLMs and incorporates a lightweight post-hoc
filtering module to select rationale sentences based on sentence-level
factuality and relevance scores. Extensive experiments on four popular
benchmarks demonstrate that DiFaR outperforms four baseline categories by up to
5.9% and boosts existing detectors by as much as 8.7%. Both automatic metrics
and human evaluations confirm that DiFaR significantly improves rationale
quality across all three dimensions.

Abstract: In the study of trustworthy Natural Language Processing (NLP), a number of
important research fields have emerged, including that of
\textit{explainability} and \textit{privacy}. While research interest in both
explainable and privacy-preserving NLP has increased considerably in recent
years, there remains a lack of investigation at the intersection of the two.
This leaves a considerable gap in understanding of whether achieving
\textit{both} explainability and privacy is possible, or whether the two are at
odds with each other. In this work, we conduct an empirical investigation into
the privacy-explainability trade-off in the context of NLP, guided by the
popular overarching methods of \textit{Differential Privacy} (DP) and Post-hoc
Explainability. Our findings include a view into the intricate relationship
between privacy and explainability, which is formed by a number of factors,
including the nature of the downstream task and choice of the text
privatization and explainability method. In this, we highlight the potential
for privacy and explainability to co-exist, and we summarize our findings in a
collection of practical recommendations for future work at this important
intersection.

Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在多种任务中表现优异，但存在文本主导问题，即过度依赖文本而忽视其他模态。本文旨在系统研究这一问题并提出解决方案。

Method: 通过提出Modality Dominance Index (MDI)和Attention Efficiency Index (AEI)两种指标，对不同模态的数据进行分析，并设计了一种标记压缩方法。

Result: 研究发现文本主导问题在所有测试模态中普遍存在，并提出了三种原因：注意力稀释、融合架构设计和任务表述偏向文本。标记压缩方法显著改善了模型平衡（如LLaVA-7B的MDI从10.23降至0.86）。

Conclusion: 本文为开发更公平和全面的多模态语言模型提供了分析框架和方法基础。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities across a diverse range of multimodal tasks. However, these models
suffer from a core problem known as text dominance: they depend heavily on text
for their inference, while underutilizing other modalities. While prior work
has acknowledged this phenomenon in vision-language tasks, often attributing it
to data biases or model architectures. In this paper, we conduct the first
systematic investigation of text dominance across diverse data modalities,
including images, videos, audio, time-series, and graphs. To measure this
imbalance, we propose two evaluation metrics: the Modality Dominance Index
(MDI) and the Attention Efficiency Index (AEI). Our comprehensive analysis
reveals that text dominance is both significant and pervasive across all tested
modalities. Our in-depth analysis identifies three underlying causes: attention
dilution from severe token redundancy in non-textual modalities, the influence
of fusion architecture design, and task formulations that implicitly favor
textual inputs. Furthermore, we propose a simple token compression method that
effectively rebalances model attention. Applying this method to LLaVA-7B, for
instance, drastically reduces its MDI from 10.23 to a well-balanced value of
0.86. Our analysis and methodological framework offer a foundation for the
development of more equitable and comprehensive multimodal language models.

mechanistic interpretability research on large language models. The need for
widespread accessibility of LLM interpretability infrastructure in Europe
drives this initiative to democratize advanced model analysis capabilities for
the research community. The project introduces a GPU-based cluster hosted at
Ansbach University of Applied Sciences and interconnected with partner
institutions, enabling remote model inspection via the NNsight API. A
structured pilot study involving 16 researchers from across Europe evaluated
the platform's technical performance, usability, and scientific utility. Users
conducted interventions such as activation patching, causal tracing, and
representation analysis on models including GPT-2 and DeepSeek-R1-70B. The
study revealed a gradual increase in user engagement, stable platform
performance throughout, and a positive reception of the remote experimentation
capabilities. It also marked the starting point for building a user community
around the platform. Identified limitations such as prolonged download
durations for activation data as well as intermittent execution interruptions
are addressed in the roadmap for future development. This initiative marks a
significant step towards widespread accessibility of LLM interpretability
infrastructure in Europe and lays the groundwork for broader deployment,
expanded tooling, and sustained community collaboration in mechanistic

Abstract: Millions of individuals worldwide are affected by deafness and hearing
impairment. Sign language serves as a sophisticated means of communication for
the deaf and hard of hearing. However, in societies that prioritize spoken
languages, sign language often faces underestimation, leading to communication
barriers and social exclusion. The Continuous Bangla Sign Language Translation
project aims to address this gap by enhancing translation methods. While recent
approaches leverage transformer architecture for state-of-the-art results, our
method integrates graph-based methods with the transformer architecture. This
fusion, combining transformer and STGCN-LSTM architectures, proves more
effective in gloss-free translation. Our contributions include architectural
fusion, exploring various fusion strategies, and achieving a new
state-of-the-art performance on diverse sign language datasets, namely
RWTH-PHOENIX-2014T, CSL-Daily, How2Sign, and BornilDB v1.0. Our approach
demonstrates superior performance compared to current translation outcomes
across all datasets, showcasing notable improvements of BLEU-4 scores of 4.01,
2.07, and 0.5, surpassing those of GASLT, GASLT and slt_how2sign in
RWTH-PHOENIX-2014T, CSL-Daily, and How2Sign, respectively. Also, we introduce
benchmarking on the BornilDB v1.0 dataset for the first time. Our method sets a
benchmark for future research, emphasizing the importance of gloss-free
translation to improve communication accessibility for the deaf and hard of
hearing.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为ICE的新框架，通过双向注意力机制和迭代优化过程，将传统的前缀提示范式改进为更适合扩散大语言模型（dLLMs）的原地提示策略，显著提升了性能和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统大语言模型（LLMs）的前缀提示和顺序生成方式限制了双向信息的灵活性，而扩散大语言模型（dLLMs）的双向注意力机制和迭代优化过程为更灵活的提示策略提供了机会。

Method: 提出ICE框架，通过将提示直接集成到掩码标记位置中，并结合置信度感知的提前退出机制，减少计算开销。

Result: 实验表明，ICE在GSM8K上实现了17.29%的准确率提升和4.12倍的加速，在MMLU上实现了276.67倍的加速，同时保持竞争力。

Conclusion: ICE为扩散大语言模型提供了一种高效的提示策略，显著提升了性能和计算效率。

Abstract: Despite large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success, their
prefix-only prompting paradigm and sequential generation process offer limited
flexibility for bidirectional information. Diffusion large language models
(dLLMs) present new opportunities through their bidirectional attention
mechanisms and iterative refinement processes, enabling more flexible in-place
prompting strategies. We introduce ICE (In-Place Chain-of-Thought Prompting
with Early Exit), a novel framework that transforms prefix-only prompting into
in-place prompting specifically designed for dLLMs. ICE integrates in-place
prompts directly within masked token positions during iterative refinement and
employs a confidence-aware early exit mechanism to significantly reduce
computational overhead. Extensive experiments demonstrate ICE's effectiveness,
achieving up to 17.29% accuracy improvement with 4.12$\times$ speedup on GSM8K,
and up to 276.67$\times$ acceleration on MMLU while maintaining competitive
performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决同行评审中新颖性评估的不足，尤其是在高负荷领域（如NLP）中评审资源紧张的问题。

Method: 采用三阶段方法：内容提取、相关文献检索与综合、结构化比较，基于大规模人类评审数据分析。

Result: 在182份ICLR 2025投稿中，与人类评审的新颖性结论一致性达75.3%，推理对齐率达86.5%。

Conclusion: 结构化LLM辅助方法能提升评审的严谨性和透明度，同时保留人类专家的核心作用。

Abstract: Novelty assessment is a central yet understudied aspect of peer review,
particularly in high volume fields like NLP where reviewer capacity is
increasingly strained. We present a structured approach for automated novelty
evaluation that models expert reviewer behavior through three stages: content
extraction from submissions, retrieval and synthesis of related work, and
structured comparison for evidence based assessment. Our method is informed by
a large scale analysis of human written novelty reviews and captures key
patterns such as independent claim verification and contextual reasoning.
Evaluated on 182 ICLR 2025 submissions with human annotated reviewer novelty
assessments, the approach achieves 86.5% alignment with human reasoning and
75.3% agreement on novelty conclusions - substantially outperforming existing
LLM based baselines. The method produces detailed, literature aware analyses
and improves consistency over ad hoc reviewer judgments. These results
highlight the potential for structured LLM assisted approaches to support more
rigorous and transparent peer review without displacing human expertise. Data
and code are made available.

TL;DR: MS-GRPO算法通过多步信用分配和优势加权采样策略，有效提升了小型LLM在序列决策任务中的性能，3B参数模型表现优于72B基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）在序列决策任务中潜力巨大，但依赖大模型导致计算成本高，需改进小型模型。现有方法无法处理多步任务中的信用分配问题。

Method: 提出MS-GRPO算法，基于TSMG和LAP框架，将累积奖励分配到每一步，并结合优势加权采样策略。

Result: 在Snake和Frozen Lake任务中，3B参数模型表现优于72B基线50%。

Conclusion: 针对性后训练是替代依赖模型规模的实用高效方法，可提升LLM在序列决策任务中的性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) show potential as sequential decision-making
agents, but their application is often limited due to a reliance on large,
computationally expensive models. This creates a need to improve smaller
models, yet existing post-training methods are designed for single-turn
interactions and cannot handle credit assignment in multi-step agentic tasks.
To address this, we introduce Multi-Step Group-Relative Policy Optimization
(MS-GRPO), a new algorithm for post-training LLM agents, grounded in formal
Text-Mediated Stochastic Game (TSMG) and Language-Agent Policy (LAP)
frameworks. For credit assignment, MS-GRPO attributes the entire cumulative
episode reward to each individual episode step. We supplement this algorithm
with a novel absolute-advantage-weighted episode sampling strategy that we show
improves training performance. We evaluate our approach by post-training a
3-billion parameter model on Snake and Frozen Lake. Our experiments demonstrate
that the method is effective in improving decision-making performance: our
post-trained 3B parameter model outperforms a 72B parameter baseline by 50% on
the Frozen Lake task. This work demonstrates that targeted post-training is a
practical and efficient alternative to relying on model scale for creating
sequential decision-making agents using LLMs.

Abstract: Amidst a shortage of qualified mental health professionals, the integration
of large language models (LLMs) into psychological applications offers a
promising way to alleviate the growing burden of mental health disorders.
Recent reasoning-augmented LLMs have achieved remarkable performance in
mathematics and programming, while research in the psychological domain has
predominantly emphasized emotional support and empathetic dialogue, with
limited attention to reasoning mechanisms that are beneficial to generating
reliable responses. Therefore, in this paper, we propose Psyche-R1, the first
Chinese psychological LLM that jointly integrates empathy, psychological
expertise, and reasoning, built upon a novel data curation pipeline.
Specifically, we design a comprehensive data synthesis pipeline that produces
over 75k high-quality psychological questions paired with detailed rationales,
generated through chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning and iterative
prompt-rationale optimization, along with 73k empathetic dialogues.
Subsequently, we employ a hybrid training strategy wherein challenging samples
are identified through a multi-LLM cross-selection strategy for group relative
policy optimization (GRPO) to improve reasoning ability, while the remaining
data is used for supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to enhance empathetic response
generation and psychological domain knowledge. Extensive experiment results
demonstrate the effectiveness of the Psyche-R1 across several psychological
benchmarks, where our 7B Psyche-R1 achieves comparable results to 671B
DeepSeek-R1.

Abstract: Recent advancements in machine learning have spurred growing interests in
automated interpreting quality assessment. Nevertheless, existing research
suffers from insufficient examination of language use quality, unsatisfactory
modeling effectiveness due to data scarcity and imbalance, and a lack of
efforts to explain model predictions. To address these gaps, we propose a
multi-dimensional modeling framework that integrates feature engineering, data
augmentation, and explainable machine learning. This approach prioritizes
explainability over ``black box'' predictions by utilizing only
construct-relevant, transparent features and conducting Shapley Value (SHAP)
analysis. Our results demonstrate strong predictive performance on a novel
English-Chinese consecutive interpreting dataset, identifying BLEURT and
CometKiwi scores to be the strongest predictive features for fidelity,
pause-related features for fluency, and Chinese-specific phraseological
diversity metrics for language use. Overall, by placing particular emphasis on
explainability, we present a scalable, reliable, and transparent alternative to
traditional human evaluation, facilitating the provision of detailed diagnostic
feedback for learners and supporting self-regulated learning advantages not
afforded by automated scores in isolation.

Result: SSRL训练的策略模型在搜索驱动的RL训练中表现高效且稳定，减少对外部工具的依赖。

Conclusion: LLMs的内部知识可有效利用，SSRL能减少幻觉并支持更可扩展的RL训练。

Abstract: We investigate the potential of large language models (LLMs) to serve as
efficient simulators for agentic search tasks in reinforcement learning (RL),
thereby reducing dependence on costly interactions with external search
engines. To this end, we first quantify the intrinsic search capability of LLMs
via structured prompting and repeated sampling, which we term Self-Search. Our
results reveal that LLMs exhibit strong scaling behavior with respect to the
inference budget, achieving high pass@k on question-answering benchmarks,
including the challenging BrowseComp task. Building on these observations, we
introduce Self-Search RL (SSRL), which enhances LLMs' Self-Search capability
through format-based and rule-based rewards. SSRL enables models to iteratively
refine their knowledge utilization internally, without requiring access to
external tools. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that SSRL-trained policy
models provide a cost-effective and stable environment for search-driven RL
training, reducing reliance on external search engines and facilitating robust
sim-to-real transfer. We draw the following conclusions: 1) LLMs possess world
knowledge that can be effectively elicited to achieve high performance; 2) SSRL
demonstrates the potential of leveraging internal knowledge to reduce
hallucination; 3) SSRL-trained models integrate seamlessly with external search
engines without additional effort. Our findings highlight the potential of LLMs
to support more scalable RL agent training.

Abstract: Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) are rapidly emerging as a powerful and
promising alternative to the dominant autoregressive (AR) paradigm. By
generating tokens in parallel through an iterative denoising process, DLMs
possess inherent advantages in reducing inference latency and capturing
bidirectional context, thereby enabling fine-grained control over the
generation process. While achieving a several-fold speed-up, recent
advancements have allowed DLMs to show performance comparable to their
autoregressive counterparts, making them a compelling choice for various
natural language processing tasks. In this survey, we provide a holistic
overview of the current DLM landscape. We trace its evolution and relationship
with other paradigms, such as autoregressive and masked language models, and
cover both foundational principles and state-of-the-art models. Our work offers
an up-to-date, comprehensive taxonomy and an in-depth analysis of current
techniques, from pre-training strategies to advanced post-training methods.
Another contribution of this survey is a thorough review of DLM inference
strategies and optimizations, including improvements in decoding parallelism,
caching mechanisms, and generation quality. We also highlight the latest
approaches to multimodal extensions of DLMs and delineate their applications
across various practical scenarios. Furthermore, our discussion addresses the
limitations and challenges of DLMs, including efficiency, long-sequence
handling, and infrastructure requirements, while outlining future research
directions to sustain progress in this rapidly evolving field. Project GitHub

Abstract: The large spread of disinformation across digital platforms creates
significant challenges to information integrity. This paper presents a
multi-agent system that uses relation extraction to detect disinformation in
news articles, focusing on titles and short text snippets. The proposed Agentic
AI system combines four agents: (i) a machine learning agent (logistic
regression), (ii) a Wikipedia knowledge check agent (which relies on named
entity recognition), (iii) a coherence detection agent (using LLM prompt
engineering), and (iv) a web-scraped data analyzer that extracts relational
triplets for fact checking. The system is orchestrated via the Model Context
Protocol (MCP), offering shared context and live learning across components.
Results demonstrate that the multi-agent ensemble achieves 95.3% accuracy with
an F1 score of 0.964, significantly outperforming individual agents and
traditional approaches. The weighted aggregation method, mathematically derived
from individual agent misclassification rates, proves superior to algorithmic
threshold optimization. The modular architecture makes the system easily
scalable, while also maintaining details of the decision processes.

Abstract: As AI-generated content becomes widespread, so does the risk of
misinformation. While prior research has primarily focused on identifying
whether content is authentic, much less is known about how such content
influences human perception and behavior. In domains like trading or the stock
market, predicting how people react (e.g., whether a news post will go viral),
can be more critical than verifying its factual accuracy. To address this, we
take a human-centered approach and introduce the MhAIM Dataset, which contains
154,552 online posts (111,153 of them AI-generated), enabling large-scale
analysis of how people respond to AI-generated content. Our human study reveals
that people are better at identifying AI content when posts include both text
and visuals, particularly when inconsistencies exist between the two. We
propose three new metrics: trustworthiness, impact, and openness, to quantify
how users judge and engage with online content. We present T-Lens, an LLM-based
agent system designed to answer user queries by incorporating predicted human
responses to multimodal information. At its core is HR-MCP (Human Response
Model Context Protocol), built on the standardized Model Context Protocol
(MCP), enabling seamless integration with any LLM. This integration allows
T-Lens to better align with human reactions, enhancing both interpretability
and interaction capabilities. Our work provides empirical insights and
practical tools to equip LLMs with human-awareness capabilities. By
highlighting the complex interplay among AI, human cognition, and information
reception, our findings suggest actionable strategies for mitigating the risks
of AI-driven misinformation.

this work, we only found one open-source DRA, termed Open Deep Research (ODR).
In this work we adapt the challenging recent BrowseComp benchmark to compare
ODR to existing proprietary systems. We propose BrowseComp-Small (BC-Small),
comprising a subset of BrowseComp, as a more computationally-tractable DRA
benchmark for academic labs. We benchmark ODR and two other proprietary systems
on BC-Small: one system from Anthropic and one system from Google. We find that
all three systems achieve 0% accuracy on the test set of 60 questions. We
introduce three strategic improvements to ODR, resulting in the ODR+ model,
which achieves a state-of-the-art 10% success rate on BC-Small among both
closed-source and open-source systems. We report ablation studies indicating
that all three of our improvements contributed to the success of ODR+.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型（LRMs）的长链推理（CoT）输出增加了计算成本并可能导致过度思考，需平衡推理效率与质量。

Method: 分析生成路径分布，通过难度估计筛选轨迹，并在Bradley-Terry损失框架下优化偏好，提出LCPO方法直接平衡NLL损失相关的隐式奖励。

Result: 实验表明，LCPO在多个基准测试中平均输出长度减少超50%，同时保持推理性能。

Conclusion: LCPO展示了在有限数据和训练下高效引导LRMs的潜力，为计算效率提供了新方向。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have demonstrated strong
performance on complex tasks through long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning.
However, their lengthy outputs increase computational costs and may lead to
overthinking, raising challenges in balancing reasoning effectiveness and
efficiency. Current methods for efficient reasoning often compromise reasoning
quality or require extensive resources. This paper investigates efficient
methods to reduce the generation length of LRMs. We analyze generation path
distributions and filter generated trajectories through difficulty estimation.
Subsequently, we analyze the convergence behaviors of the objectives of various
preference optimization methods under a Bradley-Terry loss based framework.
Based on the analysis, we propose Length Controlled Preference Optimization
(LCPO) that directly balances the implicit reward related to NLL loss. LCPO can
effectively learn length preference with limited data and training. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces the average
output length by over 50\% across multiple benchmarks while maintaining the
reasoning performance. Our work highlights the potential for computationally
efficient approaches in guiding LRMs toward efficient reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM-based AutoML系统存在探索策略受限和执行瓶颈问题，KompeteAI旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 引入动态解决方案空间探索和合并阶段，结合RAG扩展假设空间，使用预测评分和加速调试优化执行效率。

Result: KompeteAI在MLE-Bench上平均性能提升3%，并加速管道评估6.9倍。

Conclusion: KompeteAI通过创新方法解决了AutoML系统的关键问题，性能显著优于现有技术。

Abstract: Recent Large Language Model (LLM)-based AutoML systems demonstrate impressive
capabilities but face significant limitations such as constrained exploration
strategies and a severe execution bottleneck. Exploration is hindered by
one-shot methods lacking diversity and Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)
approaches that fail to recombine strong partial solutions. The execution
bottleneck arises from lengthy code validation cycles that stifle iterative
refinement. To overcome these challenges, we introduce KompeteAI, a novel
AutoML framework with dynamic solution space exploration. Unlike previous MCTS
methods that treat ideas in isolation, KompeteAI introduces a merging stage
that composes top candidates. We further expand the hypothesis space by
integrating Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), sourcing ideas from Kaggle
notebooks and arXiv papers to incorporate real-world strategies. KompeteAI also
addresses the execution bottleneck via a predictive scoring model and an
accelerated debugging method, assessing solution potential using early stage
metrics to avoid costly full-code execution. This approach accelerates pipeline
evaluation 6.9 times. KompeteAI outperforms leading methods (e.g., RD-agent,
AIDE, and Ml-Master) by an average of 3\% on the primary AutoML benchmark,
MLE-Bench. Additionally, we propose Kompete-bench to address limitations in
MLE-Bench, where KompeteAI also achieves state-of-the-art results

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过量化离散事件对系统未来熵的影响，提升AI系统在不确定性建模中的能力。

Method: 将物理学中的熵势概念调整为AI适用的事件中心度量，强调条件期望以考虑反事实场景。

Result: 在策略评估、内在奖励设计、可解释AI和异常检测等应用中展示了熵势的统一性和潜力。

Conclusion: 熵势框架为AI中的不确定性管理提供了理论基础、可解释性和多功能性，连接了热力学、信息论和机器学习。

Abstract: This work demonstrates how the concept of the entropic potential of events --
a parameter quantifying the influence of discrete events on the expected future
entropy of a system -- can enhance uncertainty quantification, decision-making,
and interpretability in artificial intelligence (AI). Building on its original
formulation in physics, the framework is adapted for AI by introducing an
event-centric measure that captures how actions, observations, or other
discrete occurrences impact uncertainty at future time horizons. Both the
original and AI-adjusted definitions of entropic potential are formalized, with
the latter emphasizing conditional expectations to account for counterfactual
scenarios. Applications are explored in policy evaluation, intrinsic reward
design, explainable AI, and anomaly detection, highlighting the metric's
potential to unify and strengthen uncertainty modeling in intelligent systems.
Conceptual examples illustrate its use in reinforcement learning, Bayesian
inference, and anomaly detection, while practical considerations for
computation in complex AI models are discussed. The entropic potential
framework offers a theoretically grounded, interpretable, and versatile
approach to managing uncertainty in AI, bridging principles from
thermodynamics, information theory, and machine learning.

<details>

Motivation: 大型推理模型（LRMs）在复杂推理任务中表现优异，但存在过度思考问题，导致计算资源浪费和效率降低。现有方法需要预设任务评估，限制了灵活性和可靠性。

Method: 提出VSRM机制，根据推理轨迹中中间状态的表现分配奖励，结合PPO和Reinforce++算法进行实验验证。

Result: 在AIME24和AIME25等数学推理基准测试中，VSRM显著减少了输出长度，同时保持了原有推理性能，有效抑制了无效步骤。

Conclusion: VSRM通过奖励有效推理步骤，从根本上缓解了过度思考问题，为高效推理提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have recently achieved significant progress in
complex reasoning tasks, aided by reinforcement learning with verifiable
rewards. However, LRMs often suffer from overthinking, expending excessive
computation on simple problems and reducing efficiency. Existing efficient
reasoning methods typically require accurate task assessment to preset token
budgets or select reasoning modes, which limits their flexibility and
reliability. In this work, we revisit the essence of overthinking and identify
that encouraging effective steps while penalizing ineffective ones is key to
its solution. To this end, we propose a novel rule-based verifiable stepwise
reward mechanism (VSRM), which assigns rewards based on the performance of
intermediate states in the reasoning trajectory. This approach is intuitive and
naturally fits the step-by-step nature of reasoning tasks. We conduct extensive
experiments on standard mathematical reasoning benchmarks, including AIME24 and
AIME25, by integrating VSRM with PPO and Reinforce++. Results show that our
method achieves substantial output length reduction while maintaining original
reasoning performance, striking an optimal balance between efficiency and
accuracy. Further analysis of overthinking frequency and pass@k score before
and after training demonstrates that our approach in deed effectively
suppresses ineffective steps and encourages effective reasoning, fundamentally
alleviating the overthinking problem. All code will be released upon
acceptance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统HATRPO方法为所有智能体分配相同的KL阈值，导致在异构环境中更新缓慢且局部最优。

Method: 提出HATRPO-W（基于KKT优化）和HATRPO-G（贪心算法）两种方法，动态分配KL阈值。

Result: 实验表明，两种方法均显著提升HATRPO性能，最终奖励提升超过22.5%，且HATRPO-W更稳定。

Conclusion: 动态KL阈值分配在多智能体强化学习中具有显著优势，尤其是HATRPO-W在性能和稳定性上表现更佳。

Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) requires coordinated and stable
policy updates among interacting agents. Heterogeneous-Agent Trust Region
Policy Optimization (HATRPO) enforces per-agent trust region constraints using
Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence to stabilize training. However, assigning each
agent the same KL threshold can lead to slow and locally optimal updates,
especially in heterogeneous settings. To address this limitation, we propose
two approaches for allocating the KL divergence threshold across agents:
HATRPO-W, a Karush-Kuhn-Tucker-based (KKT-based) method that optimizes
threshold assignment under global KL constraints, and HATRPO-G, a greedy
algorithm that prioritizes agents based on improvement-to-divergence ratio. By
connecting sequential policy optimization with constrained threshold
scheduling, our approach enables more flexible and effective learning in
heterogeneous-agent settings. Experimental results demonstrate that our methods
significantly boost the performance of HATRPO, achieving faster convergence and
higher final rewards across diverse MARL benchmarks. Specifically, HATRPO-W and
HATRPO-G achieve comparable improvements in final performance, each exceeding
22.5%. Notably, HATRPO-W also demonstrates more stable learning dynamics, as
reflected by its lower variance.

Abstract: We investigate the capacity of Large Language Models (LLMs) for imaginative
reasoning--the proactive construction, testing, and revision of hypotheses in
information-sparse environments. Existing benchmarks, often static or focused
on social deduction, fail to capture the dynamic, exploratory nature of this
reasoning process. To address this gap, we introduce a comprehensive research
framework based on the classic "Turtle Soup" game, integrating a benchmark, an
agent, and an evaluation protocol. We present TurtleSoup-Bench, the first
large-scale, bilingual, interactive benchmark for imaginative reasoning,
comprising 800 turtle soup puzzles sourced from both the Internet and expert
authors. We also propose Mosaic-Agent, a novel agent designed to assess LLMs'
performance in this setting. To evaluate reasoning quality, we develop a
multi-dimensional protocol measuring logical consistency, detail completion,
and conclusion alignment. Experiments with leading LLMs reveal clear capability
limits, common failure patterns, and a significant performance gap compared to
humans. Our work offers new insights into LLMs' imaginative reasoning and
establishes a foundation for future research on exploratory agent behavior.

Result: 在四个QA基准测试中，LeanRAG显著优于现有方法，响应质量提升且检索冗余减少46%。

Conclusion: LeanRAG通过优化知识聚合与检索策略，显著提升了RAG的效果和效率。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) plays a crucial role in grounding Large
Language Models by leveraging external knowledge, whereas the effectiveness is
often compromised by the retrieval of contextually flawed or incomplete
information. To address this, knowledge graph-based RAG methods have evolved
towards hierarchical structures, organizing knowledge into multi-level
summaries. However, these approaches still suffer from two critical,
unaddressed challenges: high-level conceptual summaries exist as disconnected
``semantic islands'', lacking the explicit relations needed for cross-community
reasoning; and the retrieval process itself remains structurally unaware, often
degenerating into an inefficient flat search that fails to exploit the graph's
rich topology. To overcome these limitations, we introduce LeanRAG, a framework
that features a deeply collaborative design combining knowledge aggregation and
retrieval strategies. LeanRAG first employs a novel semantic aggregation
algorithm that forms entity clusters and constructs new explicit relations
among aggregation-level summaries, creating a fully navigable semantic network.
Then, a bottom-up, structure-guided retrieval strategy anchors queries to the
most relevant fine-grained entities and then systematically traverses the
graph's semantic pathways to gather concise yet contextually comprehensive
evidence sets. The LeanRAG can mitigate the substantial overhead associated
with path retrieval on graphs and minimizes redundant information retrieval.
Extensive experiments on four challenging QA benchmarks with different domains
demonstrate that LeanRAG significantly outperforming existing methods in
response quality while reducing 46\% retrieval redundancy. Code is available

Result: 在MIMIC-III和MIMIC-IV数据集上表现优异，对未见代码保持高准确性。

Conclusion: HiRef通过本体和EHR结合，显著提升了药物推荐的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Medication recommendation is a crucial task for assisting physicians in
making timely decisions from longitudinal patient medical records. However,
real-world EHR data present significant challenges due to the presence of
rarely observed medical entities and incomplete records that may not fully
capture the clinical ground truth. While data-driven models trained on
longitudinal Electronic Health Records often achieve strong empirical
performance, they struggle to generalize under missing or novel conditions,
largely due to their reliance on observed co-occurrence patterns. To address
these issues, we propose Hierarchical Ontology and Network Refinement for
Robust Medication Recommendation (HiRef), a unified framework that combines two
complementary structures: (i) the hierarchical semantics encoded in curated
medical ontologies, and (ii) refined co-occurrence patterns derived from
real-world EHRs. We embed ontology entities in hyperbolic space, which
naturally captures tree-like relationships and enables knowledge transfer
through shared ancestors, thereby improving generalizability to unseen codes.
To further improve robustness, we introduce a prior-guided sparse
regularization scheme that refines the EHR co-occurrence graph by suppressing
spurious edges while preserving clinically meaningful associations. Our model
achieves strong performance on EHR benchmarks (MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV) and
maintains high accuracy under simulated unseen-code settings. Extensive
experiments with comprehensive ablation studies demonstrate HiRef's resilience
to unseen medical codes, supported by in-depth analyses of the learned
sparsified graph structure and medical code embeddings.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive
capabilities across various tasks, but still struggle with complex mathematical
reasoning. Existing research primarily focuses on dataset construction and
method optimization, often overlooking two critical aspects: comprehensive
knowledge-driven design and model-centric data space modeling. In this paper,
we introduce We-Math 2.0, a unified system that integrates a structured
mathematical knowledge system, model-centric data space modeling, and a
reinforcement learning (RL)-based training paradigm to comprehensively enhance
the mathematical reasoning abilities of MLLMs. The key contributions of We-Math
2.0 are fourfold: (1) MathBook Knowledge System: We construct a five-level
hierarchical system encompassing 491 knowledge points and 1,819 fundamental
principles. (2) MathBook-Standard & Pro: We develop MathBook-Standard, a
dataset that ensures broad conceptual coverage and flexibility through dual
expansion. Additionally, we define a three-dimensional difficulty space and
generate 7 progressive variants per problem to build MathBook-Pro, a
challenging dataset for robust training. (3) MathBook-RL: We propose a
two-stage RL framework comprising: (i) Cold-Start Fine-tuning, which aligns the
model with knowledge-oriented chain-of-thought reasoning; and (ii) Progressive
Alignment RL, leveraging average-reward learning and dynamic data scheduling to
achieve progressive alignment across difficulty levels. (4) MathBookEval: We
introduce a comprehensive benchmark covering all 491 knowledge points with
diverse reasoning step distributions. Experimental results show that
MathBook-RL performs competitively with existing baselines on four widely-used
benchmarks and achieves strong results on MathBookEval, suggesting promising
generalization in mathematical reasoning.

Motivation: 现有对话推荐系统难以有效整合外部知识图谱信息，导致推荐结果与用户期望不符。

Method: STEP采用三阶段课程逐步对齐对话上下文与知识图谱实体，并通过双提示方案（对话前缀和推荐前缀）注入冻结的语言模型。

Result: 在两个公开数据集上，STEP在推荐精度和对话质量上优于主流方法。

Conclusion: STEP通过课程引导和双提示方案，显著提升了对话推荐系统的性能。

Abstract: Conversational recommender systems (CRSs) aim to proactively capture user
preferences through natural language dialogue and recommend high-quality items.
To achieve this, CRS gathers user preferences via a dialog module and builds
user profiles through a recommendation module to generate appropriate
recommendations. However, existing CRS faces challenges in capturing the deep
semantics of user preferences and dialogue context. In particular, the
efficient integration of external knowledge graph (KG) information into
dialogue generation and recommendation remains a pressing issue. Traditional
approaches typically combine KG information directly with dialogue content,
which often struggles with complex semantic relationships, resulting in
recommendations that may not align with user expectations.
  To address these challenges, we introduce STEP, a conversational recommender
centered on pre-trained language models that combines curriculum-guided
context-knowledge fusion with lightweight task-specific prompt tuning. At its
heart, an F-Former progressively aligns the dialogue context with
knowledge-graph entities through a three-stage curriculum, thus resolving
fine-grained semantic mismatches. The fused representation is then injected
into the frozen language model via two minimal yet adaptive prefix prompts: a
conversation prefix that steers response generation toward user intent and a
recommendation prefix that biases item ranking toward knowledge-consistent
candidates. This dual-prompt scheme allows the model to share cross-task
semantics while respecting the distinct objectives of dialogue and
recommendation. Experimental results show that STEP outperforms mainstream
methods in the precision of recommendation and dialogue quality in two public
datasets.

Motivation: 解决LLM在生成SPARQL查询时因缺乏SKG特定内容和模式知识导致的结构不一致和语义不准确问题。

Method: 提出FIRESPARQL框架，结合微调LLM、RAG和SPARQL查询修正层，并在SciQA基准上评估多种配置。

Result: 微调配置表现最佳，查询准确率达0.90 ROUGE-L，结果准确率达0.85 RelaxedEM。

Conclusion: FIRESPARQL框架显著提升了SKG问答中SPARQL查询的生成质量，微调是核心优化手段。

Abstract: Question answering over Scholarly Knowledge Graphs (SKGs) remains a
challenging task due to the complexity of scholarly content and the intricate
structure of these graphs. Large Language Model (LLM) approaches could be used
to translate natural language questions (NLQs) into SPARQL queries; however,
these LLM-based approaches struggle with SPARQL query generation due to limited
exposure to SKG-specific content and the underlying schema. We identified two
main types of errors in the LLM-generated SPARQL queries: (i) structural
inconsistencies, such as missing or redundant triples in the queries, and (ii)
semantic inaccuracies, where incorrect entities or properties are shown in the
queries despite a correct query structure. To address these issues, we propose
FIRESPARQL, a modular framework that supports fine-tuned LLMs as a core
component, with optional context provided via retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG) and a SPARQL query correction layer. We evaluate the framework on the
SciQA Benchmark using various configurations (zero-shot, zero-shot with RAG,
one-shot, fine-tuning, and fine-tuning with RAG) and compare the performance
with baseline and state-of-the-art approaches. We measure query accuracy using
BLEU and ROUGE metrics, and query result accuracy using relaxed exact
match(RelaxedEM), with respect to the gold standards containing the NLQs,
SPARQL queries, and the results of the queries. Experimental results
demonstrate that fine-tuning achieves the highest overall performance, reaching
0.90 ROUGE-L for query accuracy and 0.85 RelaxedEM for result accuracy on the

*Ivan Khai Ze Lim,Ningyi Liao,Yiming Yang,Gerald Wei Yong Yip,Siqiang Luo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于大型语言模型（LLM）的空间查询系统SEQ-GPT，用于支持更灵活的空间范例查询（SEQ），通过自然语言交互提升用户体验。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前空间服务（如在线地图）主要依赖用户查询进行位置搜索，但在处理复杂任务（如同时搜索多个相关位置）时体验受限。

Method: 引入SEQ-GPT系统，利用LLM的自然语言能力实现交互式SEQ搜索，并提出一个适配LLM的流程，通过对话合成和多模型协作将自然语言与结构化空间数据对齐。

Result: SEQ-GPT展示了通过自然语言交互动态调整搜索的能力，并提供了端到端的实际应用场景演示。

Conclusion: SEQ-GPT为扩展空间搜索功能提供了新的可能性，尤其是在复杂任务中通过自然语言交互提升用户体验。

Abstract: Contemporary spatial services such as online maps predominantly rely on user
queries for location searches. However, the user experience is limited when
performing complex tasks, such as searching for a group of locations
simultaneously. In this study, we examine the extended scenario known as
Spatial Exemplar Query (SEQ), where multiple relevant locations are jointly
searched based on user-specified examples. We introduce SEQ-GPT, a spatial
query system powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) towards more versatile SEQ
search using natural language. The language capabilities of LLMs enable unique
interactive operations in the SEQ process, including asking users to clarify
query details and dynamically adjusting the search based on user feedback. We
also propose a tailored LLM adaptation pipeline that aligns natural language
with structured spatial data and queries through dialogue synthesis and
multi-model cooperation. SEQ-GPT offers an end-to-end demonstration for
broadening spatial search with realistic data and application scenarios.

*Shicheng Xu,Xin Huang,Zihao Wei,Liang Pang,Huawei Shen,Xueqi Cheng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出DxDirector-7B，一种能主导全流程临床诊断的AI模型，显著减少医生工作量并提高诊断准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI在临床诊断中仅作为辅助工具，无法从模糊主诉开始主导全流程诊断，限制了其减轻医生负担的潜力。

Method: 提出DxDirector-7B，一种具备深度思考能力的LLM，能主导诊断流程并建立责任框架。

Result: 在罕见、复杂及真实案例中，DxDirector-7B诊断准确性显著优于现有模型，并大幅减少医生工作量。

Conclusion: DxDirector-7B标志着AI从辅助工具转变为诊断主导者，为高效精准诊断提供新范式。

Abstract: Full-process clinical diagnosis in the real world encompasses the entire
diagnostic workflow that begins with only an ambiguous chief complaint. While
artificial intelligence (AI), particularly large language models (LLMs), is
transforming clinical diagnosis, its role remains largely as an assistant to
physicians. This AI-assisted working pattern makes AI can only answer specific
medical questions at certain parts within the diagnostic process, but lack the
ability to drive the entire diagnostic process starting from an ambiguous
complaint, which still relies heavily on human physicians. This gap limits AI's
ability to fully reduce physicians' workload and enhance diagnostic efficiency.
To address this, we propose a paradigm shift that reverses the relationship
between physicians and AI: repositioning AI as the primary director, with
physicians serving as its assistants. So we present DxDirector-7B, an LLM
endowed with advanced deep thinking capabilities, enabling it to drive the
full-process diagnosis with minimal physician involvement. Furthermore,
DxDirector-7B establishes a robust accountability framework for misdiagnoses,
delineating responsibility between AI and human physicians. In evaluations
across rare, complex, and real-world cases under full-process diagnosis
setting, DxDirector-7B not only achieves significant superior diagnostic
accuracy but also substantially reduces physician workload than
state-of-the-art medical LLMs as well as general-purpose LLMs. Fine-grained
analyses across multiple clinical departments and tasks validate its efficacy,
with expert evaluations indicating its potential to serve as a viable
substitute for medical specialists. These findings mark a new era where AI,
traditionally a physicians' assistant, now drives the entire diagnostic process
to drastically reduce physicians' workload, indicating an efficient and
accurate diagnostic solution.

*Yushi Feng,Junye Du,Yingying Hong,Qifan Wang,Lequan Yu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PASS是一种多模态框架，通过概率标注的决策路径和动态工具选择，解决了现有医疗AI系统的黑盒推理、多模态整合不足和效率低下问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工具增强的代理系统在医疗领域存在黑盒推理、多模态整合不足和效率低下等问题，限制了其实际应用。

Method: PASS通过自适应采样多工具图上的代理工作流，利用任务条件分布选择工具，并采用三阶段训练优化性能与成本平衡。

Result: PASS在多个基准测试中显著优于基线模型，同时平衡了计算成本。

Conclusion: PASS为医疗AI系统提供了一种可解释、自适应和多模态的新范式。

Abstract: Existing tool-augmented agentic systems are limited in the real world by (i)
black-box reasoning steps that undermine trust of decision-making and pose
safety risks, (ii) poor multimodal integration, which is inherently critical
for healthcare tasks, and (iii) rigid and computationally inefficient agentic
pipelines. We introduce PASS (Probabilistic Agentic Supernet Sampling), the
first multimodal framework to address these challenges in the context of Chest
X-Ray (CXR) reasoning. PASS adaptively samples agentic workflows over a
multi-tool graph, yielding decision paths annotated with interpretable
probabilities. Given the complex CXR reasoning task with multimodal medical
data, PASS leverages its learned task-conditioned distribution over the agentic
supernet. Thus, it adaptively selects the most suitable tool at each supernet
layer, offering probability-annotated trajectories for post-hoc audits and
directly enhancing medical AI safety. PASS also continuously compresses salient
findings into an evolving personalized memory, while dynamically deciding
whether to deepen its reasoning path or invoke an early exit for efficiency. To
optimize a Pareto frontier balancing performance and cost, we design a novel
three-stage training procedure, including expert knowledge warm-up, contrastive
path-ranking, and cost-aware reinforcement learning. To facilitate rigorous
evaluation, we introduce CAB-E, a comprehensive benchmark for multi-step,
safety-critical, free-form CXR reasoning. Experiments across various benchmarks
validate that PASS significantly outperforms strong baselines in multiple
metrics (e.g., accuracy, AUC, LLM-J.) while balancing computational costs,
pushing a new paradigm shift towards interpretable, adaptive, and multimodal
medical agentic systems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文探讨了语言模型（LM）与人类偏好对齐的问题，提出静态和动态偏好数据在优化效果上的差异，并引入对齐阶段假设来解释这种现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究语言模型对齐人类偏好的方法，发现动态偏好数据并非总是最优，需要更深入的理论解释。

Method: 提出对齐阶段假设，将对齐过程分为偏好注入和偏好微调两个阶段，并通过实验验证其普适性。

Result: 实验表明，动态数据在不同模型上效果差异显著（如Llama-3效果提升3倍，Zephyr效果降低0.4倍）。

Conclusion: 对齐阶段假设能有效解释数据选择的影响，并提出边界测量方法，为LM对齐提供了新视角。

Abstract: The alignment of language models (LMs) with human preferences is critical for
building reliable AI systems. The problem is typically framed as optimizing an
LM policy to maximize the expected reward that reflects human preferences.
Recently, Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) was proposed as a LM alignment
method that directly optimize the policy from static preference data, and
further improved by incorporating on-policy sampling (i.e., preference
candidates generated during the training loop) for better LM alignment.
However, we show on-policy data is not always optimal, with systematic
effectiveness difference emerging between static and on-policy preference
candidates. For example, on-policy data can result in a 3$\times$ effectiveness
compared with static data for Llama-3, and a 0.4$\times$ effectiveness for
Zephyr. To explain the phenomenon, we propose the alignment stage assumption,
which divides the alignment process into two distinct stages: the preference
injection stage, which benefits from diverse data, and the preference
fine-tuning stage, which favors high-quality data. Through theoretical and
empirical analysis, we characterize these stages and propose an effective
algorithm to identify the boundaries between them. We perform experiments on 5
models (Llama, Zephyr, Phi-2, Qwen, Pythia) and 2 alignment methods (DPO,
SLiC-HF) to show the generalizability of alignment stage assumption and
boundary measurement.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为ComMCS的方法，通过结合当前和后续步骤的蒙特卡洛估计器，减少方差并保持无偏估计，从而提升大型语言模型在复杂推理任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在复杂推理任务（如数学）中的表现仍有不足，主要原因是基于价值的过程验证器在训练注释中存在估计误差。

Method: 提出ComMCS方法，通过线性组合当前和后续步骤的蒙特卡洛估计器，构建无偏估计器以减少方差。

Result: 在MATH-500和GSM8K基准测试中，ComMCS比回归优化方法和非方差减少基线分别提高了2.8和2.2分。

Conclusion: ComMCS方法有效减少了估计误差，提升了LLMs在复杂推理任务中的表现，且无需额外计算成本。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in a wide range
of tasks. However, their reasoning capabilities, particularly in complex
domains like mathematics, remain a significant challenge. Value-based process
verifiers, which estimate the probability of a partial reasoning chain leading
to a correct solution, are a promising approach for improving reasoning.
Nevertheless, their effectiveness is often hindered by estimation error in
their training annotations, a consequence of the limited number of Monte Carlo
(MC) samples feasible due to the high cost of LLM inference. In this paper, we
identify that the estimation error primarily arises from high variance rather
than bias, and the MC estimator is a Minimum Variance Unbiased Estimator
(MVUE). To address the problem, we propose the \textsc{Com}pound \textsc{M}onte
\textsc{C}arlo \textsc{S}ampling (ComMCS) method, which constructs an unbiased
estimator by linearly combining the MC estimators from the current and
subsequent steps. Theoretically, we show that our method leads to a predictable
reduction in variance, while maintaining an unbiased estimation without
additional LLM inference cost. We also perform empirical experiments on the
MATH-500 and GSM8K benchmarks to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.
Notably, ComMCS outperforms regression-based optimization method by 2.8 points,
the non-variance-reduced baseline by 2.2 points on MATH-500 on Best-of-32
sampling experiment.

TL;DR: MSRS通过正交子空间分配和动态权重整合，有效减少多属性控制中的干扰，提升模型行为调控的精确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在多属性联合调控时存在干扰和权衡问题，需要一种更有效的解决方案。

Method: 提出MSRS框架，通过正交子空间分配隔离属性影响，结合共享子空间和动态权重整合，实现多属性精确调控。

Result: 实验表明MSRS显著减少属性冲突，优于现有方法，并能泛化到多样下游任务。

Conclusion: MSRS为多属性调控提供了一种高效且通用的解决方案。

Abstract: Activation steering offers a promising approach to controlling the behavior
of Large Language Models by directly manipulating their internal activations.
However, most existing methods struggle to jointly steer multiple attributes,
often resulting in interference and undesirable trade-offs. To address this
challenge, we propose Multi-Subspace Representation Steering (MSRS), a novel
framework for effective multi-attribute steering via subspace representation
fine-tuning. MSRS reduces inter-attribute interference by allocating orthogonal
subspaces to each attribute, isolating their influence within the model's
representation space. MSRS also incorporates a hybrid subspace composition
strategy: it combines attribute-specific subspaces for unique steering
directions with a shared subspace for common steering directions. A dynamic
weighting function learns to efficiently integrate these components for precise
control. During inference, MSRS introduces a token-level steering mechanism
that dynamically identifies and intervenes on the most semantically relevant
tokens, enabling fine-grained behavioral modulation. Experimental results show
that MSRS significantly reduces attribute conflicts, surpasses existing methods
across a range of attributes, and generalizes effectively to diverse downstream
tasks.

experiments conducted on the OAEI Bio-ML track demonstrate that GenOM can often
achieve competitive performance, surpassing many baselines including
traditional OM systems and recent LLM-based methods. Further ablation studies
confirm the effectiveness of semantic enrichment and few-shot prompting,
highlighting the framework's robustness and adaptability.

TL;DR: 提出了一种稀疏、目标感知的GNN表示方法，解决了传统全连接图在规划问题中的组合爆炸和信息稀疏问题，显著提升了大规模网格环境中的规划效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法使用全连接图表示规划状态，导致组合爆炸、信息稀疏和内存需求剧增，难以适用于大规模问题。

Method: 采用稀疏、目标感知的GNN表示，选择性编码局部相关关系并显式集成目标相关的空间特征。

Result: 实验验证了新方法在大规模网格环境中的有效性，显著提升了策略泛化能力和成功率。

Conclusion: 该方法为处理现实中的大规模广义规划任务提供了实用基础。

Abstract: Generalized planning using deep reinforcement learning (RL) combined with
graph neural networks (GNNs) has shown promising results in various symbolic
planning domains described by PDDL. However, existing approaches typically
represent planning states as fully connected graphs, leading to a combinatorial
explosion in edge information and substantial sparsity as problem scales grow,
especially evident in large grid-based environments. This dense representation
results in diluted node-level information, exponentially increases memory
requirements, and ultimately makes learning infeasible for larger-scale
problems. To address these challenges, we propose a sparse, goal-aware GNN
representation that selectively encodes relevant local relationships and
explicitly integrates spatial features related to the goal. We validate our
approach by designing novel drone mission scenarios based on PDDL within a grid
world, effectively simulating realistic mission execution environments. Our
experimental results demonstrate that our method scales effectively to larger
grid sizes previously infeasible with dense graph representations and
substantially improves policy generalization and success rates. Our findings
provide a practical foundation for addressing realistic, large-scale
generalized planning tasks.

TL;DR: 论文通过临床试验自然语言推理基准测试，发现大语言模型在知识获取和推理能力上存在结构性局限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨大语言模型是否通过数据和参数扩展获得结构化、可泛化的内部表征。

Method: 引入包含四种推理类型的临床试验基准测试，使用GKMRV探针分离知识获取和推理失败。

Result: 模型在GKMRV探针上表现优异（准确率0.918），但在主推理任务上表现差（准确率0.25），输出一致性高（0.87）。

Conclusion: 当前大语言模型缺乏结构化内部表征，无法可靠部署知识，GKMRV框架为高风险领域模型可靠性评估提供了有效方法。

Abstract: Large language models are often assumed to acquire increasingly structured,
generalizable internal representations simply by scaling data and parameters.
We interrogate this assumption by introducing a Clinical Trial Natural Language
Inference benchmark comprising four reasoning families, Causal Attribution,
Compositional Grounding, Epistemic Verification, and Risk State Abstraction.
Each item is paired with a targeted Ground Knowledge and Meta-Level Reasoning
Verification (GKMRV) probe, allowing us to dissociate failures of factual
access from failures of inference. We evaluate six contemporary LLMs under both
direct and chain of thought prompting.
  Models achieve near-ceiling GKMRV accuracy (mean accuracy 0.918) yet perform
poorly on the main reasoning tasks (mean accuracy 0.25). Despite low accuracy,
output inferences are highly consistent across samples (mean 0.87), indicating
a systematic application of underlying heuristics and shortcuts.
  These results reveal fundamental structural and representational limitations:
current LLMs often possess the relevant clinical knowledge but lack the
structured, composable internal representations needed to deploy it reliably
(e.g., integrating constraints, weighing evidence, or simulating
counterfactuals). Decoupling knowledge from reasoning with GKMRV makes this
dissociation explicit and measurable, providing an effective framework for
probing the reliability of LLMs in high-stakes domains.

<details>

Motivation: 随着AI在关键决策中的应用增加，可解释性成为提升用户理解的关键，但视觉障碍用户的可访问性研究不足。

Method: 采用文献综述（79项研究）和四部分概念验证（分类、角色定义、原型设计、评估）分析XAI的可访问性。

Result: 初步发现表明，简化解释比详细解释更易理解，多模态展示有助于提升公平性。

Conclusion: XAI设计需考虑视觉障碍用户，简化解释和多模态展示是实现包容性的关键。

Abstract: As AI systems are increasingly deployed to support decision-making in
critical domains, explainability has become a means to enhance the
understandability of these outputs and enable users to make more informed and
conscious choices. However, despite growing interest in the usability of
eXplainable AI (XAI), the accessibility of these methods, particularly for
users with vision impairments, remains underexplored. This paper investigates
accessibility gaps in XAI through a two-pronged approach. First, a literature
review of 79 studies reveals that evaluations of XAI techniques rarely include
disabled users, with most explanations relying on inherently visual formats.
Second, we present a four-part methodological proof of concept that
operationalizes inclusive XAI design: (1) categorization of AI systems, (2)
persona definition and contextualization, (3) prototype design and
implementation, and (4) expert and user assessment of XAI techniques for
accessibility. Preliminary findings suggest that simplified explanations are
more comprehensible for non-visual users than detailed ones, and that
multimodal presentation is required for more equitable interpretability.

Motivation: 由于ESN的参数选择和架构调整对性能影响复杂，且缺乏经验可能导致优化困难，因此需要理解这些因素对性能的具体影响。

Method: 通过四种不同基准问题（时间序列预测、模式生成、混沌系统预测和时间序列分类）的实验，分析ESN的性能变化。

Result: 实验展示了ESN在不同架构、设计和参数选择下的性能表现，并提出了适用的配置经验法则。

Conclusion: 本文为ESN的配置提供了实用指南，帮助初学者快速掌握参数选择和架构调整的关键点。

Abstract: This paper examines Echo State Network, a reservoir computer, performance
using four different benchmark problems, then proposes heuristics or rules of
thumb for configuring the architecture, as well as the selection of parameters
and their values, which are applicable to problems within the same domain, to
help serve to fill the experience gap needed by those entering this field of
study. The influence of various parameter selections and their value
adjustments, as well as architectural changes made to an Echo State Network, a
powerful recurrent neural network configured as a reservoir computer, can be
challenging to fully comprehend without experience in the field, and even some
hyperparameter optimization algorithms may have difficulty adjusting parameter
values without proper manual selections made first. Therefore, it is imperative
to understand the effects of parameters and their value selection on Echo State
Network architecture performance for a successful build. Thus, to address the
requirement for an extensive background in Echo State Network architecture, as
well as examine how Echo State Network performance is affected with respect to
variations in architecture, design, and parameter selection and values, a
series of benchmark tasks representing different problem domains, including
time series prediction, pattern generation, chaotic system prediction, and time
series classification, were modeled and experimented on to show the impact on
the performance of Echo State Network.

Result: OpenFPL在2024-25赛季前瞻测试中表现与商业服务相当，且在高回报球员预测上超越商业基准。

Conclusion: OpenFPL为玩家提供了开源的高精度预测工具，支持长期规划和短期决策。

Abstract: Fantasy Premier League engages the football community in selecting the
Premier League players who will perform best from gameweek to gameweek. Access
to accurate performance forecasts gives participants an edge over competitors
by guiding expectations about player outcomes and reducing uncertainty in squad
selection. However, high-accuracy forecasts are currently limited to commercial
services whose inner workings are undisclosed and that rely on proprietary
data. This paper aims to democratize access to highly accurate forecasts of
player performance by presenting OpenFPL, an open-source Fantasy Premier League
forecasting method developed exclusively from public data. Comprising
position-specific ensemble models optimized on Fantasy Premier League and
Understat data from four previous seasons (2020-21 to 2023-24), OpenFPL
achieves accuracy comparable to a leading commercial service when tested
prospectively on data from the 2024-25 season. OpenFPL also surpasses the
commercial benchmark for high-return players ($>$ 2 points), which are most
influential for rank gains. These findings hold across one-, two-, and
three-gameweek forecast horizons, supporting long-term planning of transfers
and strategies while also informing final-day decisions.

Motivation: 现有ITL方法缺乏评估框架，无法验证其是否真正捕捉标注者个体倾向并提供有意义的解释。

Method: 提出两种新指标：DIC量化模型捕捉标注者倾向的能力，BAE评估模型解释与标注者行为的一致性。

Result: 实验验证了所提评估框架的有效性。

Conclusion: 该框架填补了ITL方法评估的空白，为理解标注者行为提供了可靠工具。

Abstract: Recent works have emerged in multi-annotator learning that shift focus from
Consensus-oriented Learning (CoL), which aggregates multiple annotations into a
single ground-truth prediction, to Individual Tendency Learning (ITL), which
models annotator-specific labeling behavior patterns (i.e., tendency) to
provide explanation analysis for understanding annotator decisions. However, no
evaluation framework currently exists to assess whether ITL methods truly
capture individual tendencies and provide meaningful behavioral explanations.
To address this gap, we propose the first unified evaluation framework with two
novel metrics: (1) Difference of Inter-annotator Consistency (DIC) quantifies
how well models capture annotator tendencies by comparing predicted
inter-annotator similarity structures with ground-truth; (2) Behavior Alignment
Explainability (BAE) evaluates how well model explanations reflect annotator
behavior and decision relevance by aligning explainability-derived with
ground-truth labeling similarity structures via Multidimensional Scaling (MDS).
Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our proposed evaluation
framework.

Conclusion: xRFM在表格数据任务中表现出色，同时通过平均梯度外积提供可解释性。

Abstract: Inference from tabular data, collections of continuous and categorical
variables organized into matrices, is a foundation for modern technology and
science. Yet, in contrast to the explosive changes in the rest of AI, the best
practice for these predictive tasks has been relatively unchanged and is still
primarily based on variations of Gradient Boosted Decision Trees (GBDTs). Very
recently, there has been renewed interest in developing state-of-the-art
methods for tabular data based on recent developments in neural networks and
feature learning methods. In this work, we introduce xRFM, an algorithm that
combines feature learning kernel machines with a tree structure to both adapt
to the local structure of the data and scale to essentially unlimited amounts
of training data.
  We show that compared to $31$ other methods, including recently introduced
tabular foundation models (TabPFNv2) and GBDTs, xRFM achieves best performance
across $100$ regression datasets and is competitive to the best methods across
$200$ classification datasets outperforming GBDTs. Additionally, xRFM provides
interpretability natively through the Average Gradient Outer Product.

  We enrolled and randomized 13,463 Fitbit users into four study arms: control,
random, fixed, and RL. The control arm received no nudges. The other three arms
received nudges from a bank of 155 nudges based on behavioral science
principles. The random arm received nudges selected at random. The fixed arm
received nudges based on a pre-set logic from survey responses about PA
barriers. The RL group received nudges selected by an adaptive RL algorithm. We
included 7,711 participants in primary analyses (mean age 42.1, 86.3% female,
baseline steps 5,618.2).
  We observed an increase in PA for the RL group compared to all other groups
from baseline to 1 and 2 months. The RL group had significantly increased
average daily step count at 1 month compared to all other groups: control (+296
steps, p=0.0002), random (+218 steps, p=0.005), and fixed (+238 steps,
p=0.002). At 2 months, the RL group sustained a significant increase compared
to the control group (+210 steps, p=0.0122). Generalized estimating equation
models also revealed a sustained increase in daily steps in the RL group vs.
control (+208 steps, p=0.002). These findings demonstrate the potential of a
scalable, behaviorally-informed RL approach to personalize digital health
interventions for PA.

Abstract: Time series forecasting is a critical first step in generating demand plans
for supply chains. Experiments on time series models typically focus on
demonstrating improvements in forecast accuracy over existing/baseline
solutions, quantified according to some accuracy metric. There is no doubt that
forecast accuracy is important; however in production systems, demand planners
often value consistency and stability over incremental accuracy improvements.
Assuming that the inputs have not changed significantly, forecasts that vary
drastically from one planning cycle to the next require high amounts of human
intervention, which frustrates demand planners and can even cause them to lose
trust in ML forecasting models. We study model-induced stochasticity, which
quantifies the variance of a set of forecasts produced by a single model when
the set of inputs is fixed. Models with lower variance are more stable.
  Recently the forecasting community has seen significant advances in forecast
accuracy through the development of deep machine learning models for time
series forecasting. We perform a case study measuring the stability and
accuracy of state-of-the-art forecasting models (Chronos, DeepAR, PatchTST,
Temporal Fusion Transformer, TiDE, and the AutoGluon best quality ensemble) on
public data sets from the M5 competition and Favorita grocery sales. We show
that ensemble models improve stability without significantly deteriorating (or
even improving) forecast accuracy. While these results may not be surprising,
the main point of this paper is to propose the need for further study of
forecast stability for models that are being deployed in production systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于LLM的生成内容不一定符合形式语言的语法约束，现有方法不适用于扩散模型，因此需要新的解决方案。

Conclusion: 该方法高效且实用，适用于扩散模型的形式语言约束解码。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown promising performance across diverse
domains. Many practical applications of LLMs, such as code completion and
structured data extraction, require adherence to syntactic constraints
specified by a formal language. Yet, due to their probabilistic nature, LLM
output is not guaranteed to adhere to such formal languages. Prior work has
proposed constrained decoding as a means to restrict LLM generation to
particular formal languages. However, existing works are not applicable to the
emerging paradigm of diffusion LLMs, when used in practical scenarios such as
the generation of formally correct C++ or JSON output. In this paper we address
this challenge and present the first constrained decoding method for diffusion
models, one that can handle formal languages captured by context-free grammars.
We begin by reducing constrained decoding to the more general additive
infilling problem, which asks whether a partial output can be completed to a
valid word in the target language. This problem also naturally subsumes the
previously unaddressed multi-region infilling constrained decoding. We then
reduce this problem to the task of deciding whether the intersection of the
target language and a regular language is empty and present an efficient
algorithm to solve it for context-free languages. Empirical results on various
applications, such as C++ code infilling and structured data extraction in
JSON, demonstrate that our method achieves near-perfect syntactic correctness
while consistently preserving or improving functional correctness. Importantly,
our efficiency optimizations ensure that the computational overhead remains
practical.

Abstract: For large language models (LLMs), reasoning over graphs could help solve many
problems. Prior work has tried to improve LLM graph reasoning by examining how
best to serialize graphs as text and by combining GNNs and LLMs. However, the
merits of such approaches remain unclear, so we empirically answer the
following research questions: (1) Can LLMs learn to solve fundamental graph
tasks without specialized graph encoding models?, (2) Can LLMs generalize
learned solutions to unseen graph structures or tasks?, and (3) What are the
merits of competing approaches to learn graph tasks? We show that even small
LLMs can learn to solve graph tasks by training them with instructive
chain-of-thought solutions, and this training generalizes, without specialized
graph encoders, to new tasks and graph structures.

Conclusion: CAD-RL为自动化CAD建模提供了高效解决方案，并发布了ExeCAD数据集支持后续研究。

Abstract: Computer-Aided Design (CAD) plays a vital role in engineering and
manufacturing, yet current CAD workflows require extensive domain expertise and
manual modeling effort. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have
made it possible to generate code from natural language, opening new
opportunities for automating parametric 3D modeling. However, directly
translating human design intent into executable CAD code remains highly
challenging, due to the need for logical reasoning, syntactic correctness, and
numerical precision. In this work, we propose CAD-RL, a multimodal
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) guided reinforcement learning post training framework
for CAD modeling code generation. Our method combines CoT-based Cold Start with
goal-driven reinforcement learning post training using three task-specific
rewards: executability reward, geometric accuracy reward, and external
evaluation reward. To ensure stable policy learning under sparse and
high-variance reward conditions, we introduce three targeted optimization
strategies: Trust Region Stretch for improved exploration, Precision Token Loss
for enhanced dimensions parameter accuracy, and Overlong Filtering to reduce
noisy supervision. To support training and benchmarking, we release ExeCAD, a
noval dataset comprising 16,540 real-world CAD examples with paired natural
language and structured design language descriptions, executable CADQuery
scripts, and rendered 3D models. Experiments demonstrate that CAD-RL achieves
significant improvements in reasoning quality, output precision, and code
executability over existing VLMs.

Result: 在数学推理基准测试中提高了计算效率（tokens/sec），同时性能与基线ReFT相当。

Conclusion: Nested-ReFT通过优化计算成本，为LLM在复杂推理任务中的高效训练提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Advanced reasoning in LLMs on challenging domains like mathematical reasoning
can be tackled using verifiable rewards based reinforced fine-tuning (ReFT). In
standard ReFT frameworks, a behavior model generates multiple completions with
answers per problem, for the answer to be then scored by a reward function.
While such RL post-training methods demonstrate significant performance
improvements across challenging reasoning domains, the computational cost of
generating completions during training with multiple inference steps makes the
training cost non-trivial. To address this, we draw inspiration from off-policy
RL, and speculative decoding to introduce a novel ReFT framework, dubbed
Nested-ReFT, where a subset of layers of the target model acts as the behavior
model to generate off-policy completions during training. The behavior model
configured with dynamic layer skipping per batch during training decreases the
inference cost compared to the standard ReFT frameworks. Our theoretical
analysis shows that Nested-ReFT yields unbiased gradient estimates with
controlled variance. Our empirical analysis demonstrates improved computational
efficiency measured as tokens/sec across multiple math reasoning benchmarks and
model sizes. Additionally, we explore three variants of bias mitigation to
minimize the off-policyness in the gradient updates that allows for maintaining
performance that matches the baseline ReFT performance.

Result: 在三个多元时间序列分类数据集上，显著优于现有预训练方法。

Conclusion: 预训练目标与理论嵌入几何对齐能显著提升性能。

Abstract: Deep neural networks for time series must capture complex temporal patterns,
to effectively represent dynamic data. Self- and semi-supervised learning
methods show promising results in pre-training large models, which -- when
finetuned for classification -- often outperform their counterparts trained
from scratch. Still, the choice of pretext training tasks is often heuristic
and their transferability to downstream classification is not granted, thus we
propose a novel semi-supervised pre-training strategy to enforce latent
representations that satisfy the Neural Collapse phenomenon observed in
optimally trained neural classifiers. We use a rotational equiangular tight
frame-classifier and pseudo-labeling to pre-train deep encoders with few
labeled samples. Furthermore, to effectively capture temporal dynamics while
enforcing embedding separability, we integrate generative pretext tasks with
our method, and we define a novel sequential augmentation strategy. We show
that our method significantly outperforms previous pretext tasks when applied
to LSTMs, transformers, and state-space models on three multivariate time
series classification datasets. These results highlight the benefit of aligning
pre-training objectives with theoretically grounded embedding geometry.

Conclusion: 该方法不仅性能优越，还能通过反事实解释提供结果的可解释性。

Abstract: Accurate and explainable out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is required to
use machine learning systems safely. Previous work has shown that feature
distance to decision boundaries can be used to identify OOD data effectively.
In this paper, we build on this intuition and propose a post-hoc OOD detection
method that, given an input, calculates the distance to decision boundaries by
leveraging counterfactual explanations. Since computing explanations can be
expensive for large architectures, we also propose strategies to improve
scalability by computing counterfactuals directly in embedding space.
Crucially, as the method employs counterfactual explanations, we can seamlessly
use them to help interpret the results of our detector. We show that our method
is in line with the state of the art on CIFAR-10, achieving 93.50% AUROC and
25.80% FPR95. Our method outperforms these methods on CIFAR-100 with 97.05%
AUROC and 13.79% FPR95 and on ImageNet-200 with 92.55% AUROC and 33.55% FPR95

Abstract: Mixture models have attracted significant attention due to practical
effectiveness and comprehensive theoretical foundations. A persisting challenge
is model misspecification, which occurs when the model to be fitted has more
mixture components than those in the data distribution. In this paper, we
develop a theoretical understanding of the Expectation-Maximization (EM)
algorithm's behavior in the context of targeted model misspecification for
overspecified two-component Mixed Linear Regression (2MLR) with unknown
$d$-dimensional regression parameters and mixing weights. In Theorem 5.1 at the
population level, with an unbalanced initial guess for mixing weights, we
establish linear convergence of regression parameters in $O(\log(1/\epsilon))$
steps. Conversely, with a balanced initial guess for mixing weights, we observe
sublinear convergence in $O(\epsilon^{-2})$ steps to achieve the
$\epsilon$-accuracy at Euclidean distance. In Theorem 6.1 at the finite-sample
level, for mixtures with sufficiently unbalanced fixed mixing weights, we
demonstrate a statistical accuracy of $O((d/n)^{1/2})$, whereas for those with
sufficiently balanced fixed mixing weights, the accuracy is $O((d/n)^{1/4})$
given $n$ data samples. Furthermore, we underscore the connection between our
population level and finite-sample level results: by setting the desired final
accuracy $\epsilon$ in Theorem 5.1 to match that in Theorem 6.1 at the
finite-sample level, namely letting $\epsilon = O((d/n)^{1/2})$ for
sufficiently unbalanced fixed mixing weights and $\epsilon = O((d/n)^{1/4})$
for sufficiently balanced fixed mixing weights, we intuitively derive iteration
complexity bounds $O(\log (1/\epsilon))=O(\log (n/d))$ and
$O(\epsilon^{-2})=O((n/d)^{1/2})$ at the finite-sample level for sufficiently
unbalanced and balanced initial mixing weights. We further extend our analysis
in overspecified setting to low SNR regime.

Conclusion: 通过基准测试引导AI发展，将评估转化为学习，强调测试任务的新颖性对衡量推理模型泛化能力的重要性。

Abstract: Evaluation of reasoning language models gained importance after it was
observed that they can combine their existing capabilities into novel traces of
intermediate steps before task completion and that the traces can sometimes
help them to generalize better than past models. As reasoning becomes the next
scaling dimension of large language models, careful study of their capabilities
in critical tasks is needed. We show that better performance is not always
caused by test-time algorithmic improvements or model sizes but also by using
impactful benchmarks as curricula for learning. We call this benchmark-driven
selection of AI and show its effects on DeepSeek-R1 using our sequential
decision-making problem from Humanity's Last Exam. Steering development of AI
by impactful benchmarks trades evaluation for learning and makes novelty of
test tasks key for measuring generalization capabilities of reasoning models.
Consequently, some benchmarks could be seen as curricula for training rather
than unseen test sets.

Abstract: Monitoring cattle health and optimizing yield are key challenges faced by
dairy farmers due to difficulties in tracking all animals on the farm. This
work aims to showcase modern data-driven farming practices based on explainable
machine learning(ML) methods that explain the activity and behaviour of dairy
cattle (cows). Continuous data collection of 3-axis accelerometer sensors and
usage of robust ML methodologies and algorithms, provide farmers and
researchers with actionable information on cattle activity, allowing farmers to
make informed decisions and incorporate sustainable practices. This study
utilizes Bluetooth-based Internet of Things (IoT) devices and 4G networks for
seamless data transmission, immediate analysis, inference generation, and
explains the models performance with explainability frameworks. Special
emphasis is put on the pre-processing of the accelerometers time series data,
including the extraction of statistical characteristics, signal processing
techniques, and lag-based features using the sliding window technique. Various
hyperparameter-optimized ML models are evaluated across varying window lengths
for activity classification. The k-nearest neighbour Classifier achieved the
best performance, with AUC of mean 0.98 and standard deviation of 0.0026 on the
training set and 0.99 on testing set). In order to ensure transparency,
Explainable AI based frameworks such as SHAP is used to interpret feature
importance that can be understood and used by practitioners. A detailed
comparison of the important features, along with the stability analysis of
selected features, supports development of explainable and practical ML models
for sustainable livestock management.

Abstract: The transnational ivory trade continues to drive the decline of elephant
populations across Africa, and trafficking networks remain difficult to
disrupt. Tusks seized by law enforcement officials carry forensic information
on the traffickers responsible for their export, including DNA evidence and
handwritten markings made by traffickers. For 20 years, analyses of tusk DNA
have identified where elephants were poached and established connections among
shipments of ivory. While the links established using genetic evidence are
extremely conclusive, genetic data is expensive and sometimes impossible to
obtain. But though handwritten markings are easy to photograph, they are rarely
documented or analyzed. Here, we present an AI-driven pipeline for extracting
and analyzing handwritten markings on seized elephant tusks, offering a novel,
scalable, and low-cost source of forensic evidence. Having collected 6,085
photographs from eight large seizures of ivory over a 6-year period
(2014-2019), we used an object detection model to extract over 17,000
individual markings, which were then labeled and described using
state-of-the-art AI tools. We identified 184 recurring "signature markings"
that connect the tusks on which they appear. 20 signature markings were
observed in multiple seizures, establishing forensic links between these
seizures through traffickers involved in both shipments. This work complements
other investigative techniques by filling in gaps where other data sources are
unavailable. The study demonstrates the transformative potential of AI in
wildlife forensics and highlights practical steps for integrating handwriting
analysis into efforts to disrupt organized wildlife crime.

Conclusion: D-Wave采样未显著改进RBM训练，但结合经典-量子方法或有潜力。

Abstract: A local-valley (LV) centered approach to assessing the quality of sampling
from Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) was applied to the latest generation
of the D-Wave quantum annealer. D-Wave and Gibbs samples from a classically
trained RBM were obtained at conditions relevant to the
contrastive-divergence-based RBM learning. The samples were compared for the
number of the LVs to which they belonged and the energy of the corresponding
local minima. No significant (desirable) increase in the number of the LVs has
been achieved by decreasing the D-Wave annealing time. At any training epoch,
the states sampled by the D-Wave belonged to a somewhat higher number of LVs
than in the Gibbs sampling. However, many of those LVs found by the two
techniques differed. For high-probability sampled states, the two techniques
were (unfavorably) less complementary and more overlapping. Nevertheless, many
potentially "important" local minima, i.e., those having intermediate, even if
not high, probability values, were found by only one of the two sampling
techniques while missed by the other. The two techniques overlapped less at
later than earlier training epochs, which is precisely the stage of the
training when modest improvements to the sampling quality could make meaningful
differences for the RBM trainability. The results of this work may explain the
failure of previous investigations to achieve substantial (or any) improvement
when using D-Wave-based sampling. However, the results reveal some potential
for improvement, e.g., using a combined classical-quantum approach.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 肝硬化患者中AKI发生率高且预后差，现有预测工具准确性不足且难以融入ICU工作流程。

Method: 回顾性分析MIMIC-IV数据库，提取48小时内实验室和生理数据，通过预处理、特征选择和多种机器学习算法训练评估。

Result: LightGBM表现最优（AUROC 0.808），关键预测因子与肝硬化-AKI机制一致。

Conclusion: 该模型能准确早期预测AKI风险，高阴性预测值支持低风险患者管理，可解释性增强临床信任。

Abstract: Background: Cirrhosis is a progressive liver disease with high mortality and
frequent complications, notably acute kidney injury (AKI), which occurs in up
to 50% of hospitalized patients and worsens outcomes. AKI stems from complex
hemodynamic, inflammatory, and metabolic changes, making early detection
essential. Many predictive tools lack accuracy, interpretability, and alignment
with intensive care unit (ICU) workflows. This study developed an interpretable
machine learning model for early AKI prediction in critically ill patients with
cirrhosis.
  Methods: We conducted a retrospective analysis of the MIMIC-IV v2.2 database,
identifying 1240 adult ICU patients with cirrhosis and excluding those with ICU
stays under 48 hours or missing key data. Laboratory and physiological
variables from the first 48 hours were extracted. The pipeline included
preprocessing, missingness filtering, LASSO feature selection, and SMOTE class
balancing. Six algorithms-LightGBM, CatBoost, XGBoost, logistic regression,
naive Bayes, and neural networks-were trained and evaluated using AUROC,
accuracy, F1-score, sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values.
  Results: LightGBM achieved the best performance (AUROC 0.808, 95% CI
0.741-0.856; accuracy 0.704; NPV 0.911). Key predictors included prolonged
partial thromboplastin time, absence of outside-facility 20G placement, low pH,
and altered pO2, consistent with known cirrhosis-AKI mechanisms and suggesting
actionable targets.
  Conclusion: The LightGBM-based model enables accurate early AKI risk
stratification in ICU patients with cirrhosis using routine clinical variables.
Its high negative predictive value supports safe de-escalation for low-risk
patients, and interpretability fosters clinician trust and targeted prevention.
External validation and integration into electronic health record systems are
warranted.

Conclusion: 论文建议实践中采取措施减少或避免混杂因素，以提升推荐系统的可靠性。

Abstract: Unobserved confounding arises when an unmeasured feature influences both the
treatment and the outcome, leading to biased causal effect estimates. This
issue undermines observational studies in fields like economics, medicine,
ecology or epidemiology. Recommender systems leveraging fully observed data
seem not to be vulnerable to this problem. However many standard practices in
recommender systems result in observed features being ignored, resulting in
effectively the same problem. This paper will show that numerous common
practices such as feature engineering, A/B testing and modularization can in
fact introduce confounding into recommendation systems and hamper their
performance. Several illustrations of the phenomena are provided, supported by
simulation studies with practical suggestions about how practitioners may
reduce or avoid the affects of confounding in real systems.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了基于Transformer的语言模型在上下文学习（ICL）中学习加密函数的能力，特别是单字母替换和Vigenère密码。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究ICL在加密函数学习中的应用，评估Transformer的归纳偏置和泛化能力。

Method: 通过少量（密文、明文）对，让模型推断隐藏的双射映射并解码新密文。

Result: 模型能够从上下文中学习并推断加密函数。

Conclusion: ICL在加密函数学习中表现出潜力，适合评估Transformer的推理能力。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) has emerged as a powerful capability of
transformer-based language models, enabling them to perform tasks by
conditioning on a small number of examples presented at inference time, without
any parameter updates. Prior work has shown that transformers can generalize
over simple function classes like linear functions, decision trees, even neural
networks, purely from context, focusing on numerical or symbolic reasoning over
underlying well-structured functions. Instead, we propose a novel application
of ICL into the domain of cryptographic function learning, specifically
focusing on ciphers such as mono-alphabetic substitution and Vigen\`ere
ciphers, two classes of private-key encryption schemes. These ciphers involve a
fixed but hidden bijective mapping between plain text and cipher text
characters. Given a small set of (cipher text, plain text) pairs, the goal is
for the model to infer the underlying substitution and decode a new cipher text
word. This setting poses a structured inference challenge, which is well-suited
for evaluating the inductive biases and generalization capabilities of
transformers under the ICL paradigm. Code is available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需重新训练、不改变模型架构的Transformer后门攻击方法HPMI，通过修剪最不重要的头并注入恶意头实现攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有后门攻击方法通常需要重新训练或修改模型架构，资源消耗大且侵入性强。

Method: HPMI方法通过修剪不重要头并注入预训练的恶意头，无需重新训练或改变架构。

Result: 实验表明HPMI攻击成功率达99.55%，且能绕过四种先进防御机制，对干净数据准确性影响极小。

Conclusion: HPMI在隐蔽性和鲁棒性上优于现有方法，对模型性能影响小。

Abstract: Transformer models have demonstrated exceptional performance and have become
indispensable in computer vision (CV) and natural language processing (NLP)
tasks. However, recent studies reveal that transformers are susceptible to
backdoor attacks. Prior backdoor attack methods typically rely on retraining
with clean data or altering the model architecture, both of which can be
resource-intensive and intrusive. In this paper, we propose Head-wise Pruning
and Malicious Injection (HPMI), a novel retraining-free backdoor attack on
transformers that does not alter the model's architecture. Our approach
requires only a small subset of the original data and basic knowledge of the
model architecture, eliminating the need for retraining the target transformer.
Technically, HPMI works by pruning the least important head and injecting a
pre-trained malicious head to establish the backdoor. We provide a rigorous
theoretical justification demonstrating that the implanted backdoor resists
detection and removal by state-of-the-art defense techniques, under reasonable
assumptions. Experimental evaluations across multiple datasets further validate
the effectiveness of HPMI, showing that it 1) incurs negligible clean accuracy
loss, 2) achieves at least 99.55% attack success rate, and 3) bypasses four
advanced defense mechanisms. Additionally, relative to state-of-the-art
retraining-dependent attacks, HPMI achieves greater concealment and robustness
against diverse defense strategies, while maintaining minimal impact on clean
accuracy.

Abstract: In this current work, we propose a Max Min approach for approximating

to develop the Max Min Kantorovich-type exponential neural network operators
and investigate their approximation properties. We study both pointwise and
uniform convergence for univariate functions. To analyze the order of
convergence, we use the logarithmic modulus of continuity and estimate the
corresponding rate of convergence. Furthermore, we examine the convergence
behavior of the Max Min Kantorovich type exponential neural network operators
within the Orlicz space setting. We provide some graphical representations to
illustrate the approximation error of the function through suitable kernel and
sigmoidal activation functions.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于多智能体强化学习的自适应资源编排方法，用于解决云原生数据库系统中的高资源动态性和调度复杂性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 云原生数据库系统面临高资源动态性和调度复杂性的挑战，需要一种更高效的资源编排方法。

Conclusion: 该方法在真实大规模调度环境中表现出色，具有强泛化能力和实用价值。

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenges of high resource dynamism and scheduling
complexity in cloud-native database systems. It proposes an adaptive resource
orchestration method based on multi-agent reinforcement learning. The method
introduces a heterogeneous role-based agent modeling mechanism. This allows
different resource entities, such as compute nodes, storage nodes, and
schedulers, to adopt distinct policy representations. These agents are better
able to reflect diverse functional responsibilities and local environmental
characteristics within the system. A reward-shaping mechanism is designed to
integrate local observations with global feedback. This helps mitigate policy
learning bias caused by incomplete state observations. By combining real-time
local performance signals with global system value estimation, the mechanism
improves coordination among agents and enhances policy convergence stability. A
unified multi-agent training framework is developed and evaluated on a
representative production scheduling dataset. Experimental results show that
the proposed method outperforms traditional approaches across multiple key
metrics. These include resource utilization, scheduling latency, policy
convergence speed, system stability, and fairness. The results demonstrate
strong generalization and practical utility. Across various experimental
scenarios, the method proves effective in handling orchestration tasks with
high concurrency, high-dimensional state spaces, and complex dependency
relationships. This confirms its advantages in real-world, large-scale
scheduling environments.

Conclusion: 该方法在多租户云环境中具有实际应用潜力，适用于智能资源监控和异常诊断。

Abstract: This paper proposes an anomaly detection method based on federated learning
to address key challenges in multi-tenant cloud environments, including data
privacy leakage, heterogeneous resource behavior, and the limitations of
centralized modeling. The method establishes a federated training framework
involving multiple tenants. Each tenant trains the model locally using private
resource usage data. Through parameter aggregation, a global model is
optimized, enabling cross-tenant collaborative anomaly detection while
preserving data privacy. To improve adaptability to diverse resource usage
patterns, a personalized parameter adjustment mechanism is introduced. This
allows the model to retain tenant-specific feature representations while
sharing global knowledge. In the model output stage, the Mahalanobis distance
is used to compute anomaly scores. This enhances both the accuracy and
stability of anomaly detection. The experiments use real telemetry data from a
cloud platform to construct a simulated multi-tenant environment. The study
evaluates the model's performance under varying participation rates and noise
injection levels. These comparisons demonstrate the proposed method's
robustness and detection accuracy. Experimental results show that the proposed
method outperforms existing mainstream models across key metrics such as
Precision, Recall, and F1-Score. It also maintains stable performance in
various complex scenarios. These findings highlight the method's practical
potential for intelligent resource monitoring and anomaly diagnosis in cloud
computing environments.

Motivation: 现有在线学习方法无法有效利用重复偏移，而基于模型池的方法难以捕捉单个源组件，导致适应效果不佳。

Method: 方法分为两部分：离线通过EM算法分解源组件并训练预测模型，在线通过凸优化调整混合权重。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在多个真实回归数据集上优于基线，累计测试损失降低高达67.4%。

Conclusion: 该方法通过理论推导充分利用偏移特性，实现了优于现有方法的适应性能。

Abstract: This paper addresses source component shift adaptation, aiming to update
predictions adapting to source component shifts for incoming data streams based
on past training data. Existing online learning methods often fail to utilize
recurring shifts effectively, while model-pool-based methods struggle to
capture individual source components, leading to poor adaptation. In this
paper, we propose a source component shift adaptation method via an offline
decomposition and online mixing approach. We theoretically identify that the
problem can be divided into two subproblems: offline source component
decomposition and online mixing weight adaptation. Based on this, our method
first determines prediction models, each of which learns a source component
solely based on past training data offline through the EM algorithm. Then, it
updates the mixing weight of the prediction models for precise prediction
through online convex optimization. Thanks to our theoretical derivation, our
method fully leverages the characteristics of the shifts, achieving superior
adaptation performance over existing methods. Experiments conducted on various
real-world regression datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms
baselines, reducing the cumulative test loss by up to 67.4%.

Result: 框架在预测区间覆盖率和长度上优于传统方法，能够为短期和长期药物调整提供精确预测。

Conclusion: 通过量化不确定性，该方法支持基于证据的药物剂量决策，优化症状控制并减少副作用，提高患者生活质量。

Abstract: Parkinson's Disease (PD) medication management presents unique challenges due
to heterogeneous disease progression and treatment response. Neurologists must
balance symptom control with optimal dopaminergic dosing based on functional
disability while minimizing side effects. This balance is crucial as inadequate
or abrupt changes can cause levodopa-induced dyskinesia, wearing off, and
neuropsychiatric effects, significantly reducing quality of life. Current
approaches rely on trial-and-error decisions without systematic predictive
methods. Despite machine learning advances, clinical adoption remains limited
due to reliance on point predictions that do not account for prediction
uncertainty, undermining clinical trust and utility. Clinicians require not
only predictions of future medication needs but also reliable confidence
measures. Without quantified uncertainty, adjustments risk premature escalation
to maximum doses or prolonged inadequate symptom control. We developed a
conformal prediction framework anticipating medication needs up to two years in
advance with reliable prediction intervals and statistical guarantees. Our
approach addresses zero-inflation in PD inpatient data, where patients maintain
stable medication regimens between visits. Using electronic health records from
631 inpatient admissions at University of Florida Health (2011-2021), our
two-stage approach identifies patients likely to need medication changes, then
predicts required levodopa equivalent daily dose adjustments. Our framework
achieved marginal coverage while reducing prediction interval lengths compared
to traditional approaches, providing precise predictions for short-term
planning and wider ranges for long-term forecasting. By quantifying
uncertainty, our approach enables evidence-based decisions about levodopa
dosing, optimizing symptom control while minimizing side effects and improving
life quality.

Conclusion: SynBrain揭示了跨试验和主体的功能一致性，为神经变异性建模提供了新方法。

Abstract: Deciphering how visual stimuli are transformed into cortical responses is a
fundamental challenge in computational neuroscience. This visual-to-neural
mapping is inherently a one-to-many relationship, as identical visual inputs
reliably evoke variable hemodynamic responses across trials, contexts, and
subjects. However, existing deterministic methods struggle to simultaneously
model this biological variability while capturing the underlying functional
consistency that encodes stimulus information. To address these limitations, we
propose SynBrain, a generative framework that simulates the transformation from
visual semantics to neural responses in a probabilistic and biologically
interpretable manner. SynBrain introduces two key components: (i) BrainVAE
models neural representations as continuous probability distributions via
probabilistic learning while maintaining functional consistency through visual
semantic constraints; (ii) A Semantic-to-Neural Mapper acts as a semantic
transmission pathway, projecting visual semantics into the neural response
manifold to facilitate high-fidelity fMRI synthesis. Experimental results
demonstrate that SynBrain surpasses state-of-the-art methods in
subject-specific visual-to-fMRI encoding performance. Furthermore, SynBrain
adapts efficiently to new subjects with few-shot data and synthesizes
high-quality fMRI signals that are effective in improving data-limited
fMRI-to-image decoding performance. Beyond that, SynBrain reveals functional
consistency across trials and subjects, with synthesized signals capturing
interpretable patterns shaped by biological neural variability. The code will
be made publicly available.

Motivation: 医疗环境中需要快速适应新任务或疾病，同时保护隐私。

Method: FedKEI通过全局聚类和双层优化权重（集群间和集群内）实现知识迁移。

Result: 在皮肤病、胸部X光和视网膜OCT数据集上表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FedKEI能有效适应新疾病，提升联邦学习效率。

Abstract: In healthcare, federated learning (FL) is a widely adopted framework that
enables privacy-preserving collaboration among medical institutions. With large
foundation models (FMs) demonstrating impressive capabilities, using FMs in FL
through cost-efficient adapter tuning has become a popular approach. Given the
rapidly evolving healthcare environment, it is crucial for individual clients
to quickly adapt to new tasks or diseases by tuning adapters while drawing upon
past experiences. In this work, we introduce Federated Knowledge-Enhanced
Initialization (FedKEI), a novel framework that leverages cross-client and
cross-task transfer from past knowledge to generate informed initializations
for learning new tasks with adapters. FedKEI begins with a global clustering
process at the server to generalize knowledge across tasks, followed by the
optimization of aggregation weights across clusters (inter-cluster weights) and
within each cluster (intra-cluster weights) to personalize knowledge transfer
for each new task. To facilitate more effective learning of the inter- and
intra-cluster weights, we adopt a bi-level optimization scheme that
collaboratively learns the global intra-cluster weights across clients and
optimizes the local inter-cluster weights toward each client's task objective.
Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets of different modalities,
including dermatology, chest X-rays, and retinal OCT, demonstrate FedKEI's
advantage in adapting to new diseases compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: CLIP-Fed有效解决了异构数据下的后门防御问题，显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Existing backdoor defense methods in Federated Learning (FL) rely on the
assumption of homogeneous client data distributions or the availability of a
clean serve dataset, which limits the practicality and effectiveness. Defending
against backdoor attacks under heterogeneous client data distributions while
preserving model performance remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we
propose a FL backdoor defense framework named CLIP-Fed, which leverages the
zero-shot learning capabilities of vision-language pre-training models. By
integrating both pre-aggregation and post-aggregation defense strategies,
CLIP-Fed overcomes the limitations of Non-IID imposed on defense effectiveness.
To address privacy concerns and enhance the coverage of the dataset against
diverse triggers, we construct and augment the server dataset using the
multimodal large language model and frequency analysis without any client
samples. To address class prototype deviations caused by backdoor samples and
eliminate the correlation between trigger patterns and target labels, CLIP-Fed
aligns the knowledge of the global model and CLIP on the augmented dataset
using prototype contrastive loss and Kullback-Leibler divergence. Extensive
experiments on representative datasets validate the effectiveness of CLIP-Fed.
Compared to state-of-the-art methods, CLIP-Fed achieves an average reduction in
ASR, i.e., 2.03\% on CIFAR-10 and 1.35\% on CIFAR-10-LT, while improving
average MA by 7.92\% and 0.48\%, respectively.

Conclusion: 福利中心的公平聚类方法能更有效地满足群体需求，优于传统方法。

Abstract: Fair clustering has traditionally focused on ensuring equitable group
representation or equalizing group-specific clustering costs. However,
Dickerson et al. (2025) recently showed that these fairness notions may yield
undesirable or unintuitive clustering outcomes and advocated for a
welfare-centric clustering approach that models the utilities of the groups. In
this work, we model group utilities based on both distances and proportional
representation and formalize two optimization objectives based on
welfare-centric clustering: the Rawlsian (Egalitarian) objective and the
Utilitarian objective. We introduce novel algorithms for both objectives and
prove theoretical guarantees for them. Empirical evaluations on multiple
real-world datasets demonstrate that our methods significantly outperform
existing fair clustering baselines.

Conclusion: 该框架在IoMT环境中表现出强适用性，能有效应对零日攻击和已知威胁。

Abstract: The Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) is driving a healthcare revolution but
remains vulnerable to cyberattacks such as denial of service, ransomware, data
hijacking, and spoofing. These networks comprise resource constrained,
heterogeneous devices (e.g., wearable sensors, smart pills, implantables),
making traditional centralized Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) unsuitable
due to response delays, privacy risks, and added vulnerabilities. Centralized
IDSs require all sensors to transmit data to a central server, causing delays
or network disruptions in dense environments. Running IDSs locally on IoMT
devices is often infeasible due to limited computation, and even lightweight
IDS components remain at risk if updated models are delayed leaving them
exposed to zero-day attacks that threaten patient health and data security. We
propose a multi level IoMT IDS framework capable of detecting zero day attacks
and distinguishing between known and unknown threats. The first layer (near
Edge) filters traffic at a coarse level (attack or not) using meta-learning or
One Class Classification (OCC) with the usfAD algorithm. Subsequent layers (far
Edge, Cloud) identify attack type and novelty. Experiments on the CICIoMT2024
dataset show 99.77 percentage accuracy and 97.8 percentage F1-score. The first
layer detects zero-day attacks with high accuracy without needing new datasets,
ensuring strong applicability in IoMT environments. Additionally, the
meta-learning approach achieves high.

Abstract: Semantic communication aims to convey meaning rather than bit-perfect
reproduction, representing a paradigm shift from traditional communication.
This paper investigates distribution learning in semantic communication where
receivers must infer the underlying meaning distribution through sequential
observations. While semantic communication traditionally optimizes individual
meaning transmission, we establish fundamental conditions for learning source
statistics when priors are unknown. We prove that learnability requires full
rank of the effective transmission matrix, characterize the convergence rate of
distribution estimation, and quantify how estimation errors translate to
semantic distortion. Our analysis reveals a fundamental trade-off: encoding
schemes optimized for immediate semantic performance often sacrifice long-term
learnability. Experiments on CIFAR-10 validate our theoretical framework,
demonstrating that system conditioning critically impacts both learning rate
and achievable performance. These results provide the first rigorous
characterization of statistical learning in semantic communication and offer
design principles for systems that balance immediate performance with
adaptation capability.

Conclusion: eMamba为边缘设备上的Mamba模型部署提供了高效、低功耗的解决方案，同时保持高精度。

Abstract: State Space Model (SSM)-based machine learning architectures have recently
gained significant attention for processing sequential data. Mamba, a recent
sequence-to-sequence SSM, offers competitive accuracy with superior
computational efficiency compared to state-of-the-art transformer models. While
this advantage makes Mamba particularly promising for resource-constrained edge
devices, no hardware acceleration frameworks are currently optimized for
deploying it in such environments. This paper presents eMamba, a comprehensive
end-to-end hardware acceleration framework explicitly designed for deploying
Mamba models on edge platforms. eMamba maximizes computational efficiency by
replacing complex normalization layers with lightweight hardware-aware
alternatives and approximating expensive operations, such as SiLU activation
and exponentiation, considering the target applications. Then, it performs an
approximation-aware neural architecture search (NAS) to tune the learnable
parameters used during approximation. Evaluations with Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10,
and MARS, an open-source human pose estimation dataset, show eMamba achieves
comparable accuracy to state-of-the-art techniques using 1.63-19.9$\times$
fewer parameters. In addition, it generalizes well to large-scale natural
language tasks, demonstrating stable perplexity across varying sequence lengths
on the WikiText2 dataset. We also quantize and implement the entire eMamba
pipeline on an AMD ZCU102 FPGA and ASIC using GlobalFoundries (GF) 22 nm
technology. Experimental results show 4.95-5.62$\times$ lower latency and
2.22-9.95$\times$ higher throughput, with 4.77$\times$ smaller area,
9.84$\times$ lower power, and 48.6$\times$ lower energy consumption than
baseline solutions while maintaining competitive accuracy.

Conclusion: XQuant利用硬件计算能力消除内存瓶颈，超越现有KV缓存量化方法，接近FP16精度。

Abstract: Although LLM inference has emerged as a critical workload for many downstream
applications, efficiently inferring LLMs is challenging due to the substantial
memory footprint and bandwidth requirements. In parallel, compute capabilities
have steadily outpaced both memory capacity and bandwidth over the last few
decades, a trend that remains evident in modern GPU hardware and exacerbates
the challenge of LLM inference. As such, new algorithms are emerging that trade
increased computation for reduced memory operations. To that end, we present
XQuant, which takes advantage of this trend, enabling an order-of-magnitude
reduction in memory consumption through low-bit quantization with substantial
accuracy benefits relative to state-of-the-art KV cache quantization methods.
We accomplish this by quantizing and caching the layer input activations X,
instead of using standard KV caching, and then rematerializing the Keys and
Values on-the-fly during inference. This results in an immediate 2$\times$
memory savings compared to KV caching. By applying XQuant, we achieve up to
$\sim 7.7\times$ memory savings with $<0.1$ perplexity degradation compared to
the FP16 baseline. Furthermore, our approach leverages the fact that X values
are similar across layers. Building on this observation, we introduce
XQuant-CL, which exploits the cross-layer similarity in the X embeddings for
extreme compression. Across different models, XQuant-CL attains up to
10$\times$ memory savings relative to the FP16 baseline with only 0.01
perplexity degradation, and 12.5$\times$ memory savings with only $0.1$
perplexity degradation. XQuant exploits the rapidly increasing compute
capabilities of hardware platforms to eliminate the memory bottleneck, while
surpassing state-of-the-art KV cache quantization methods and achieving
near-FP16 accuracy across a wide range of models.

TL;DR: SC2Arena是一个支持所有可玩种族和低级别动作空间的StarCraft II基准测试，StarEvolve是一个分层框架，结合战略规划和战术执行，通过自我修正和优化实现高性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试未能全面捕捉StarCraft II的复杂性，如完整游戏背景和多样化动作空间。

Method: 提出SC2Arena基准测试和StarEvolve框架，后者采用Planner-Executor-Verifier结构和高质量数据微调。

Result: StarEvolve在战略规划中表现优异，SC2Arena提供了开发通用智能体的新见解。

Conclusion: SC2Arena和StarEvolve填补了现有基准的不足，为复杂决策任务提供了更全面的评估工具。

Abstract: Evaluating large language models (LLMs) in complex decision-making is
essential for advancing AI's ability for strategic planning and real-time
adaptation. However, existing benchmarks for tasks like StarCraft II fail to
capture the game's full complexity, such as its complete game context, diverse
action spaces, and all playable races. To address this gap, we present
SC2Arena, a benchmark that fully supports all playable races, low-level action
spaces, and optimizes text-based observations to tackle spatial reasoning
challenges. Complementing this, we introduce StarEvolve, a hierarchical
framework that integrates strategic planning with tactical execution, featuring
iterative self-correction and continuous improvement via fine-tuning on
high-quality gameplay data. Its key components include a
Planner-Executor-Verifier structure to break down gameplay, and a scoring
system for selecting high-quality training samples. Comprehensive analysis
using SC2Arena provides valuable insights into developing generalist agents
that were not possible with previous benchmarks. Experimental results also
demonstrate that our proposed StarEvolve achieves superior performance in
strategic planning. Our code, environment, and algorithms are publicly
available.

*Tianxiao Cao,Kyohei Atarashi,Hisashi Kashima*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SAM在过参数化模型中提升泛化能力，但复杂模型中的行为未充分研究。本文通过尺度不变性分析SAM的范数动态，提出Norm Deviation概念，并基于此提出DAS方法，实验证明其优于SAM且计算成本更低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索SAM在复杂模型中的行为，特别是尺度不变性模型中的范数动态，以改进其优化效果。

Method: 利用尺度不变性分析SAM的范数动态，提出Norm Deviation概念，并设计DAS方法，通过数据自适应调整核心范数。

Result: DAS在张量补全、噪声训练、模型压缩和参数高效微调中表现优于SAM，且计算成本更低。

Conclusion: DAS通过显式模拟SAM的隐式正则化行为，提供了一种高效且性能优越的优化方法。

Abstract: Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) has been proven to be an effective
optimization technique for improving generalization in overparameterized
models. While prior works have explored the implicit regularization of SAM in
simple two-core scale-invariant settings, its behavior in more general
tensorized or scale-invariant models remains underexplored. In this work, we
leverage scale-invariance to analyze the norm dynamics of SAM in general
tensorized models. We introduce the notion of \emph{Norm Deviation} as a global
measure of core norm imbalance, and derive its evolution under SAM using
gradient flow analysis. We show that SAM's implicit control of Norm Deviation
is governed by the covariance between core norms and their gradient magnitudes.
Motivated by these findings, we propose a simple yet effective method,
\emph{Deviation-Aware Scaling (DAS)}, which explicitly mimics this
regularization behavior by scaling core norms in a data-adaptive manner. Our
experiments across tensor completion, noisy training, model compression, and
parameter-efficient fine-tuning confirm that DAS achieves competitive or
improved performance over SAM, while offering reduced computational overhead.

*Asiful Arefeen,Shovito Barua Soumma,Hassan Ghasemzadeh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RealAC是一个领域无关的框架，用于生成现实且可操作的反事实解释，通过自动保留特征间的复杂依赖关系并支持用户自定义约束。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常依赖手工约束或领域知识，难以捕捉数据的复杂非线性关系，且缺乏用户偏好支持，导致反事实解释不现实或不可行。

Method: RealAC通过对齐事实和反事实实例的特征联合分布来保留特征依赖关系，并允许用户冻结不希望更改的属性。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上，RealAC在因果性、依赖保留和现实性指标上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: RealAC提供了一种因果感知和用户中心的反事实生成解决方案。

Abstract: Counterfactual explanations provide human-understandable reasoning for
AI-made decisions by describing minimal changes to input features that would
alter a model's prediction. To be truly useful in practice, such explanations
must be realistic and feasible -- they should respect both the underlying data
distribution and user-defined feasibility constraints. Existing approaches
often enforce inter-feature dependencies through rigid, hand-crafted
constraints or domain-specific knowledge, which limits their generalizability
and ability to capture complex, nonlinear relations inherent in data. Moreover,
they rarely accommodate user-specified preferences and suggest explanations
that are causally implausible or infeasible to act upon. We introduce RealAC, a
domain-agnostic framework for generating realistic and actionable
counterfactuals. RealAC automatically preserves complex inter-feature
dependencies without relying on explicit domain knowledge -- by aligning the
joint distributions of feature pairs between factual and counterfactual
instances. The framework also allows end-users to ``freeze'' attributes they
cannot or do not wish to change by suppressing change in frozen features during
optimization. Evaluations on three synthetic and two real datasets demonstrate
that RealAC balances realism with actionability. Our method outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines and Large Language Model-based counterfactual
generation techniques in causal edge score, dependency preservation score, and
IM1 realism metric and offers a solution for causality-aware and user-centric
counterfactual generation.

TL;DR: X-Node是一种自解释的图神经网络框架，通过生成每个节点的解释来提高模型的可信度，同时保持分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GNN在医学图像分类中表现优异，但其决策过程不透明，限制了在高风险临床应用中的可信度。现有解释方法多为事后全局分析，无法提供局部节点决策的深入洞察。

Method: X-Node为每个节点构建结构化上下文向量，包含可解释的局部拓扑特征，并通过轻量级Reasoner模块生成解释向量，用于重构嵌入、生成自然语言解释并反馈到消息传递中。

Result: X-Node在MedMNIST和MorphoMNIST数据集上保持分类准确性的同时，生成忠实于节点的解释。

Conclusion: X-Node通过自解释机制提升了GNN在医学图像分类中的可信度，为高风险应用提供了更透明的决策支持。

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art results in
computer vision and medical image classification tasks by capturing structural
dependencies across data instances. However, their decision-making remains
largely opaque, limiting their trustworthiness in high-stakes clinical
applications where interpretability is essential. Existing explainability
techniques for GNNs are typically post-hoc and global, offering limited insight
into individual node decisions or local reasoning. We introduce X-Node, a
self-explaining GNN framework in which each node generates its own explanation
as part of the prediction process. For every node, we construct a structured
context vector encoding interpretable cues such as degree, centrality,
clustering, feature saliency, and label agreement within its local topology. A
lightweight Reasoner module maps this context into a compact explanation
vector, which serves three purposes: (1) reconstructing the node's latent
embedding via a decoder to enforce faithfulness, (2) generating a natural
language explanation using a pre-trained LLM (e.g., Grok or Gemini), and (3)
guiding the GNN itself via a "text-injection" mechanism that feeds explanations
back into the message-passing pipeline. We evaluate X-Node on two graph
datasets derived from MedMNIST and MorphoMNIST, integrating it with GCN, GAT,
and GIN backbones. Our results show that X-Node maintains competitive
classification accuracy while producing faithful, per-node explanations.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GraphFedMIG是一个联邦图学习框架，通过生成对抗网络解决数据不平衡问题，提升模型对少数类的识别能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦图学习中，非独立同分布数据和类别不平衡问题会严重影响模型性能，尤其是少数类节点的学习。

Method: 提出GraphFedMIG框架，利用分层生成对抗网络和互信息引导机制，生成少数类特征表示。

Result: 在四个真实数据集上的实验表明，GraphFedMIG优于其他基线方法。

Conclusion: GraphFedMIG有效解决了联邦图学习中的类别不平衡问题，提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Federated graph learning (FGL) enables multiple clients to collaboratively
train powerful graph neural networks without sharing their private,
decentralized graph data. Inherited from generic federated learning, FGL is
critically challenged by statistical heterogeneity, where non-IID data
distributions across clients can severely impair model performance. A
particularly destructive form of this is class imbalance, which causes the
global model to become biased towards majority classes and fail at identifying
rare but critical events. This issue is exacerbated in FGL, as nodes from a
minority class are often surrounded by biased neighborhood information,
hindering the learning of expressive embeddings. To grapple with this
challenge, we propose GraphFedMIG, a novel FGL framework that reframes the
problem as a federated generative data augmentation task. GraphFedMIG employs a
hierarchical generative adversarial network where each client trains a local
generator to synthesize high-fidelity feature representations. To provide
tailored supervision, clients are grouped into clusters, each sharing a
dedicated discriminator. Crucially, the framework designs a mutual
information-guided mechanism to steer the evolution of these client generators.
By calculating each client's unique informational value, this mechanism
corrects the local generator parameters, ensuring that subsequent rounds of
mutual information-guided generation are focused on producing high-value,
minority-class features. We conduct extensive experiments on four real-world
datasets, and the results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed
GraphFedMIG compared with other baselines.

TL;DR: EDAPT框架通过持续模型适应消除脑机接口（BCI）的校准需求，结合群体预训练和在线微调，显著提升解码精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决脑机接口因神经信号漂移和用户差异导致的精度下降问题，减少频繁校准的需求。

Method: EDAPT框架先通过多用户数据训练基线解码器，再通过监督微调持续个性化模型。

Result: 在三个BCI任务的九个数据集中，EDAPT显著优于静态方法，且运行高效。

Conclusion: EDAPT为无校准BCI提供了实用路径，降低了部署障碍。

Abstract: Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) suffer from accuracy degradation as neural
signals drift over time and vary across users, requiring frequent recalibration
that limits practical deployment. We introduce EDAPT, a task- and
model-agnostic framework that eliminates calibration through continual model
adaptation. EDAPT first trains a baseline decoder using data from multiple
users, then continually personalizes this model via supervised finetuning as
the neural patterns evolve during use. We tested EDAPT across nine datasets
covering three BCI tasks, and found that it consistently improved accuracy over
conventional, static methods. These improvements primarily stem from combining
population-level pretraining and online continual finetuning, with unsupervised
domain adaptation providing further gains on some datasets. EDAPT runs
efficiently, updating models within 200 milliseconds on consumer-grade
hardware. Finally, decoding accuracy scales with total data budget rather than
its allocation between subjects and trials. EDAPT provides a practical pathway
toward calibration-free BCIs, reducing a major barrier to BCI deployment.

Conclusion: Πnet在多车辆运动规划等非凸偏好问题中表现优异，并提供了高效的GPU实现和调优启发式方法。

Abstract: We introduce an output layer for neural networks that ensures satisfaction of
convex constraints. Our approach, $\Pi$net, leverages operator splitting for
rapid and reliable projections in the forward pass, and the implicit function
theorem for backpropagation. We deploy $\Pi$net as a feasible-by-design
optimization proxy for parametric constrained optimization problems and obtain
modest-accuracy solutions faster than traditional solvers when solving a single
problem, and significantly faster for a batch of problems. We surpass
state-of-the-art learning approaches in terms of training time, solution
quality, and robustness to hyperparameter tuning, while maintaining similar
inference times. Finally, we tackle multi-vehicle motion planning with
non-convex trajectory preferences and provide $\Pi$net as a GPU-ready package
implemented in JAX with effective tuning heuristics.

Motivation: JEPAs比基于重构的方法更强大，因此需要一种新技术来构建更通用的控制算法和估计技术。

Method: 整合序列嵌入与神经ODE，使用损失函数强制收缩嵌入和Lipschitz常数，构建有序潜在状态空间。

Result: 在简单摆系统上仅使用图像数据成功生成了结构化潜在状态空间模型。

Conclusion: 该方法为机器人等领域开发更通用的控制算法和估计技术提供了新途径。

Abstract: With the advent of Joint Embedding Predictive Architectures (JEPAs), which
appear to be more capable than reconstruction-based methods, this paper
introduces a novel technique for creating world models using continuous-time
dynamic systems from arbitrary observation data. The proposed method integrates
sequence embeddings with neural ordinary differential equations (neural ODEs).
It employs loss functions that enforce contractive embeddings and Lipschitz
constants in state transitions to construct a well-organized latent state
space. The approach's effectiveness is demonstrated through the generation of
structured latent state-space models for a simple pendulum system using only
image data. This opens up a new technique for developing more general control
algorithms and estimation techniques with broad applications in robotics.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种统一的频谱框架，用于分析和量化解释的平滑性、忠实性及其权衡，特别针对ReLU网络的梯度解释问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ReLU网络的梯度解释因依赖单个像素而显得嘈杂且难以解释，现有方法（如GradCAM）通过生成代理模型平滑解释，但牺牲了忠实性。

Method: 引入频谱框架，系统分析平滑性和忠实性的权衡，量化并正则化ReLU网络对高频信息的贡献。

Result: 理论分析揭示了代理平滑方法如何扭曲解释，定义了“解释差距”并测量了不同后处理方法的效果。

Conclusion: 通过实验验证了理论发现，为解释方法的平滑性和忠实性提供了原则性指导。

Abstract: ReLU networks, while prevalent for visual data, have sharp transitions,
sometimes relying on individual pixels for predictions, making vanilla
gradient-based explanations noisy and difficult to interpret. Existing methods,
such as GradCAM, smooth these explanations by producing surrogate models at the
cost of faithfulness. We introduce a unifying spectral framework to
systematically analyze and quantify smoothness, faithfulness, and their
trade-off in explanations. Using this framework, we quantify and regularize the
contribution of ReLU networks to high-frequency information, providing a
principled approach to identifying this trade-off. Our analysis characterizes
how surrogate-based smoothing distorts explanations, leading to an
``explanation gap'' that we formally define and measure for different post-hoc
methods. Finally, we validate our theoretical findings across different design
choices, datasets, and ablations.

Abstract: Although one-hot encoding is commonly used for multiclass classification, it
is not always the most effective encoding mechanism. Error Correcting Output
Codes (ECOC) address multiclass classification by mapping each class to a
unique codeword used as a label. Traditional ECOC methods rely on manually
designed or randomly generated codebooks, which are labor-intensive and may
yield suboptimal, dataset-agnostic results. This paper introduces three models
for automated codebook learning based on contrastive learning, allowing
codebooks to be learned directly and adaptively from data. Across four

Motivation: 现实世界的多模态应用需要任意模态间的理解和生成能力，但现有方法在灵活性和扩展性上受限。

Method: MAGUS采用两阶段设计：认知阶段通过多智能体协作完成结构化理解与规划；决策阶段结合LLM推理和扩散模型生成。

Conclusion: MAGUS展示了无需联合训练的模块化设计在多模态任务中的潜力，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Real-world multimodal applications often require any-to-any capabilities,
enabling both understanding and generation across modalities including text,
image, audio, and video. However, integrating the strengths of autoregressive
language models (LLMs) for reasoning and diffusion models for high-fidelity
generation remains challenging. Existing approaches rely on rigid pipelines or
tightly coupled architectures, limiting flexibility and scalability. We propose
MAGUS (Multi-Agent Guided Unified Multimodal System), a modular framework that
unifies multimodal understanding and generation via two decoupled phases:
Cognition and Deliberation. MAGUS enables symbolic multi-agent collaboration
within a shared textual workspace. In the Cognition phase, three
role-conditioned multimodal LLM agents - Perceiver, Planner, and Reflector -
engage in collaborative dialogue to perform structured understanding and
planning. The Deliberation phase incorporates a Growth-Aware Search mechanism
that orchestrates LLM-based reasoning and diffusion-based generation in a
mutually reinforcing manner. MAGUS supports plug-and-play extensibility,
scalable any-to-any modality conversion, and semantic alignment - all without
the need for joint training. Experiments across multiple benchmarks, including
image, video, and audio generation, as well as cross-modal instruction
following, demonstrate that MAGUS outperforms strong baselines and
state-of-the-art systems. Notably, on the MME benchmark, MAGUS surpasses the
powerful closed-source model GPT-4o.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统MCMC方法（如模拟退火）在计算相变附近表现不佳，难以处理刚性变量和局部最优问题。NMC通过非均匀温度分布加速探索，但此前其策略设计依赖经验。

Method: 利用深度强化学习训练NMC的非局部转移策略，仅通过观察能量变化和局部最小能量景观几何作为RL奖励和状态。

Result: 在硬随机4-SAT基准测试中，训练后的策略在剩余能量、求解时间和解多样性上优于传统MCMC和非局部模拟退火。

Conclusion: 深度强化学习可有效优化NMC策略，为组合优化问题提供更高效的求解方法。

Abstract: Optimizing or sampling complex cost functions of combinatorial optimization
problems is a longstanding challenge across disciplines and applications. When
employing family of conventional algorithms based on Markov Chain Monte Carlo
(MCMC) such as simulated annealing or parallel tempering, one assumes
homogeneous (equilibrium) temperature profiles across input. This instance
independent approach was shown to be ineffective for the hardest benchmarks
near a computational phase transition when the so-called overlap-gap-property
holds. In these regimes conventional MCMC struggles to unfreeze rigid
variables, escape suboptimal basins of attraction, and sample high-quality and
diverse solutions. In order to mitigate these challenges, Nonequilibrium
Nonlocal Monte Carlo (NMC) algorithms were proposed that leverage inhomogeneous
temperature profiles thereby accelerating exploration of the configuration
space without compromising its exploitation. Here, we employ deep reinforcement
learning (RL) to train the nonlocal transition policies of NMC which were
previously designed phenomenologically. We demonstrate that the resulting
solver can be trained solely by observing energy changes of the configuration
space exploration as RL rewards and the local minimum energy landscape geometry
as RL states. We further show that the trained policies improve upon the
standard MCMC-based and nonlocal simulated annealing on hard uniform random and
scale-free random 4-SAT benchmarks in terms of residual energy,
time-to-solution, and diversity of solutions metrics.

Motivation: 现有方法难以在不重新训练的情况下生成联合相关样本并满足约束条件。

Method: PCD通过引入耦合引导项和投影步骤，协调多个扩散模型并强制执行硬约束。

Result: 在图像对生成、物体操纵和多机器人运动规划等应用中，PCD表现出更好的耦合效果和约束满足能力，且计算成本低。

Conclusion: PCD是一种高效且实用的方法，适用于需要联合生成和约束满足的任务。

Abstract: Modifications to test-time sampling have emerged as an important extension to
diffusion algorithms, with the goal of biasing the generative process to
achieve a given objective without having to retrain the entire diffusion model.
However, generating jointly correlated samples from multiple pre-trained
diffusion models while simultaneously enforcing task-specific constraints
without costly retraining has remained challenging. To this end, we propose
Projected Coupled Diffusion (PCD), a novel test-time framework for constrained
joint generation. PCD introduces a coupled guidance term into the generative
dynamics to encourage coordination between diffusion models and incorporates a
projection step at each diffusion step to enforce hard constraints.
Empirically, we demonstrate the effectiveness of PCD in application scenarios
of image-pair generation, object manipulation, and multi-robot motion planning.
Our results show improved coupling effects and guaranteed constraint
satisfaction without incurring excessive computational costs.

Abstract: Allergens, typically proteins capable of triggering adverse immune responses,
represent a significant public health challenge. To accurately identify
allergen proteins, we introduce Applm (Allergen Prediction with Protein
Language Models), a computational framework that leverages the 100-billion
parameter xTrimoPGLM protein language model. We show that Applm consistently
outperforms seven state-of-the-art methods in a diverse set of tasks that
closely resemble difficult real-world scenarios. These include identifying
novel allergens that lack similar examples in the training set, differentiating
between allergens and non-allergens among homologs with high sequence
similarity, and assessing functional consequences of mutations that create few
changes to the protein sequences. Our analysis confirms that xTrimoPGLM,
originally trained on one trillion tokens to capture general protein sequence
characteristics, is crucial for Applm's performance by detecting important
differences among protein sequences. In addition to providing Applm as
open-source software, we also provide our carefully curated benchmark datasets
to facilitate future research.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长期强化学习任务中奖励稀疏和奖励错位是主要挑战，现有方法难以定义有效的即时奖励或避免偏差。

Method: 提出SWE-oriented RL Framework支持多轮交互和自定义奖励函数，并设计G-RA方法，仅在长期奖励达标时累积即时奖励。

Result: 实验显示G-RA显著提高了任务完成率（47.6%→93.8%）和修改率（19.6%→23.8%），避免了奖励错位导致的策略退化。

Conclusion: G-RA方法在长期强化学习中实现了平衡的奖励累积，为软件工程任务提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Reward sparsity in long-horizon reinforcement learning (RL) tasks remains a
significant challenge, while existing outcome-based reward shaping struggles to
define meaningful immediate rewards without introducing bias or requiring
explicit task decomposition. Alternatively, verification-based reward shaping
uses stepwise critics, but misalignment between immediate rewards and long-term
objectives can lead to reward hacking and suboptimal policies. In this work, we
address this problem in the context of software engineering (SWE) tasks, where
multi-turn reasoning and rule-based verification are critical. We introduce the
SWE-oriented RL Framework, a unified system supporting multi-turn interaction,
docker-based execution, and customizable reward functions. Additionally, we
propose Gated Reward Accumulation (G-RA), a novel method that accumulates
immediate rewards only when high-level (long-term) rewards meet a predefined
threshold, ensuring stable RL optimization. Experiments on SWE-bench Verified
and kBench demonstrate that G-RA leads to an increase in completion rates
(47.6\% \rightarrow 93.8\% and 22.0\% \rightarrow 86.0\%) and modification
rates (19.6\% \rightarrow 23.8\% and 12.0\% \rightarrow 42.0\%), while avoiding
policy degradation caused by reward misalignment. Our findings highlight the
importance of balanced reward accumulation in long-horizon RL and provide a
practical solution.

TL;DR: CATE-B是一个开源辅助系统，利用大语言模型（LLMs）帮助用户完成从因果模型构建到治疗效果估计的全过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 观测数据中的治疗效果估计复杂且需要专业知识，现有方法难以普及。

Method: CATE-B通过因果发现、调整集识别和回归方法选择，结合LLMs提供交互式指导。

Result: 系统降低了因果分析的难度，并发布了多领域基准任务。

Conclusion: CATE-B为自动化治疗效果估计奠定了基础，推动了因果分析的普及。

Abstract: Estimating treatment effects (TE) from observational data is a critical yet
complex task in many fields, from healthcare and economics to public policy.
While recent advances in machine learning and causal inference have produced
powerful estimation techniques, their adoption remains limited due to the need
for deep expertise in causal assumptions, adjustment strategies, and model
selection. In this paper, we introduce CATE-B, an open-source co-pilot system
that uses large language models (LLMs) within an agentic framework to guide
users through the end-to-end process of treatment effect estimation. CATE-B
assists in (i) constructing a structural causal model via causal discovery and
LLM-based edge orientation, (ii) identifying robust adjustment sets through a
novel Minimal Uncertainty Adjustment Set criterion, and (iii) selecting
appropriate regression methods tailored to the causal structure and dataset
characteristics. To encourage reproducibility and evaluation, we release a
suite of benchmark tasks spanning diverse domains and causal complexities. By
combining causal inference with intelligent, interactive assistance, CATE-B
lowers the barrier to rigorous causal analysis and lays the foundation for a
new class of benchmarks in automated treatment effect estimation.

Result: 在MorphoMNIST和两个MedMNIST基准测试中，统一学习方法显著提升了模型在分布差异数据上的性能，表现出对未见数据的强鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 统一学习通过图表示和uGNN优化，有效解决了医学影像中异构模型的统一训练问题，提升了泛化能力。

Abstract: Deep learning models often struggle to maintain generalizability in medical
imaging, particularly under domain-fracture scenarios where distribution shifts
arise from varying imaging techniques, acquisition protocols, patient
populations, demographics, and equipment. In practice, each hospital may need
to train distinct models - differing in learning task, width, and depth - to
match local data. For example, one hospital may use Euclidean architectures
such as MLPs and CNNs for tabular or grid-like image data, while another may
require non-Euclidean architectures such as graph neural networks (GNNs) for
irregular data like brain connectomes. How to train such heterogeneous models
coherently across datasets, while enhancing each model's generalizability,
remains an open problem. We propose unified learning, a new paradigm that
encodes each model into a graph representation, enabling unification in a
shared graph learning space. A GNN then guides optimization of these unified
models. By decoupling parameters of individual models and controlling them
through a unified GNN (uGNN), our method supports parameter sharing and
knowledge transfer across varying architectures (MLPs, CNNs, GNNs) and
distributions, improving generalizability. Evaluations on MorphoMNIST and two
MedMNIST benchmarks - PneumoniaMNIST and BreastMNIST - show that unified
learning boosts performance when models are trained on unique distributions and
tested on mixed ones, demonstrating strong robustness to unseen data with large
distribution shifts. Code and benchmarks: https://github.com/basiralab/uGNN

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于生成对抗变换器（GATs）的新方法，用于解决能源系统模型中时间序列上采样的信息丢失和噪声问题。该方法无需真实高分辨率数据即可训练，显著降低了上采样误差并提高了应用场景的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统上采样方法在能源系统设计中存在信息丢失或噪声增加的问题，而现有高级模型（如生成模型、超分辨率模型和插补模型）因依赖高分辨率数据训练而面临应用悖论。

Result: 相比传统插值方法，该方法将上采样任务的均方根误差（RMSE）降低9%，并在模型预测控制（MPC）场景中提高了13%的准确性。

Conclusion: 生成对抗变换器（GATs）为解决时间序列上采样问题提供了高效且无需高分辨率数据的新途径，显著提升了能源系统模型的性能。

Abstract: To bridge the temporal granularity gap in energy network design and operation
based on Energy System Models, resampling of time series is required. While
conventional upsampling methods are computationally efficient, they often
result in significant information loss or increased noise. Advanced models such
as time series generation models, Super-Resolution models and imputation models
show potential, but also face fundamental challenges. The goal of time series
generative models is to learn the distribution of the original data to generate
high-resolution series with similar statistical characteristics. This is not
entirely consistent with the definition of upsampling. Time series
Super-Resolution models or imputation models can degrade the accuracy of
upsampling because the input low-resolution time series are sparse and may have
insufficient context. Moreover, such models usually rely on supervised learning
paradigms. This presents a fundamental application paradox: their training
requires the high-resolution time series that is intrinsically absent in
upsampling application scenarios. To address the mentioned upsampling issue,
this paper introduces a new method utilizing Generative Adversarial
Transformers (GATs), which can be trained without access to any ground-truth
high-resolution data. Compared with conventional interpolation methods, the
introduced method can reduce the root mean square error (RMSE) of upsampling
tasks by 9%, and the accuracy of a model predictive control (MPC) application
scenario is improved by 13%.

Result: 在多个基准数据集上表现出优越的异常检测性能、效率和扩展性。

Conclusion: FreeGAD无需训练即可高效检测异常，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Graph Anomaly Detection (GAD) aims to identify nodes that deviate from the
majority within a graph, playing a crucial role in applications such as social
networks and e-commerce. Despite the current advancements in deep
learning-based GAD, existing approaches often suffer from high deployment costs
and poor scalability due to their complex and resource-intensive training
processes. Surprisingly, our empirical findings suggest that the training phase
of deep GAD methods, commonly perceived as crucial, may actually contribute
less to anomaly detection performance than expected. Inspired by this, we
propose FreeGAD, a novel training-free yet effective GAD method. Specifically,
it leverages an affinity-gated residual encoder to generate anomaly-aware
representations. Meanwhile, FreeGAD identifies anchor nodes as pseudo-normal
and anomalous guides, followed by calculating anomaly scores through
anchor-guided statistical deviations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
FreeGAD achieves superior anomaly detection performance, efficiency, and
scalability on multiple benchmark datasets from diverse domains, without any
training or iterative optimization.

Abstract: Understanding the behavior of deep networks is crucial to increase our
confidence in their results. Despite an extensive body of work for explaining
their predictions, researchers have faced reliability issues, which can be
attributed to insufficient formalism. In our research, we adopt novel
probabilistic and spectral perspectives to formally analyze explanation
methods. Our study reveals a pervasive spectral bias stemming from the use of
gradient, and sheds light on some common design choices that have been
discovered experimentally, in particular, the use of squared gradient and input
perturbation. We further characterize how the choice of perturbation
hyperparameters in explanation methods, such as SmoothGrad, can lead to
inconsistent explanations and introduce two remedies based on our proposed
formalism: (i) a mechanism to determine a standard perturbation scale, and (ii)
an aggregation method which we call SpectralLens. Finally, we substantiate our
theoretical results through quantitative evaluations.

Result: 提出的方法显著提高了样本效率，同时保持了PGMs在大规模问题中的适用性。

Conclusion: 通过方差减少技术，本文成功解决了MORL中PGMs的样本效率问题，为复杂决策场景提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning (MORL) is a generalization of
traditional Reinforcement Learning (RL) that aims to optimize multiple, often
conflicting objectives simultaneously rather than focusing on a single reward.
This approach is crucial in complex decision-making scenarios where agents must
balance trade-offs between various goals, such as maximizing performance while
minimizing costs. We consider the problem of MORL where the objectives are
combined using a non-linear scalarization function. Just like in standard RL,
policy gradient methods (PGMs) are amongst the most effective for handling
large and continuous state-action spaces in MORL. However, existing PGMs for
MORL suffer from high sample inefficiency, requiring large amounts of data to
be effective. Previous attempts to solve this problem rely on overly strict
assumptions, losing PGMs' benefits in scalability to large state-action spaces.
In this work, we address the issue of sample efficiency by implementing
variance-reduction techniques to reduce the sample complexity of policy
gradients while maintaining general assumptions.

Motivation: 传统数据划分方法忽略了每个实例的内在质量，因此需要更稳健的验证方法。

Result: IRT揭示了数据实例的异质性，并帮助创建平衡分区，显著改善模型性能。猜测参数是关键因素。

Conclusion: IRT指导的分区策略能更好地理解模型偏差与方差的权衡，提升验证效果。

Abstract: Robust validation of Machine Learning (ML) models is essential, but
traditional data partitioning approaches often ignore the intrinsic quality of
each instance. This study proposes the use of Item Response Theory (IRT)
parameters to characterize and guide the partitioning of datasets in the model
validation stage. The impact of IRT-informed partitioning strategies on the
performance of several ML models in four tabular datasets was evaluated. The
results obtained demonstrate that IRT reveals an inherent heterogeneity of the
instances and highlights the existence of informative subgroups of instances
within the same dataset. Based on IRT, balanced partitions were created that
consistently help to better understand the tradeoff between bias and variance
of the models. In addition, the guessing parameter proved to be a determining
factor: training with high-guessing instances can significantly impair model
performance and resulted in cases with accuracy below 50%, while other
partitions reached more than 70% in the same dataset.

Abstract: Predicting changes in binding free energy ($\Delta\Delta G$) is a vital task
in protein engineering and protein-protein interaction (PPI) engineering for
drug discovery. Previous works have observed a high correlation between
$\Delta\Delta G$ and entropy, using probabilities of biologically important
objects such as side chain angles and residue identities to estimate
$\Delta\Delta G$. However, estimating the full conformational distribution of a
protein complex is generally considered intractable. In this work, we propose a
new approach to $\Delta\Delta G$ prediction that avoids this issue by instead
leveraging energy-based models for estimating the probability of a complex's
conformation. Specifically, we novelly decompose $\Delta\Delta G$ into a
sequence-based component estimated by an inverse folding model and a
structure-based component estimated by an energy model. This decomposition is
made tractable by assuming equilibrium between the bound and unbound states,
allowing us to simplify the estimation of degeneracies associated with each
state. Unlike previous deep learning-based methods, our method incorporates an
energy-based physical inductive bias by connecting the often-used sequence
log-odds ratio-based approach to $\Delta\Delta G$ prediction with a new
$\Delta\Delta E$ term grounded in statistical mechanics. We demonstrate
superiority over existing state-of-the-art structure and sequence-based deep
learning methods in $\Delta\Delta G$ prediction and antibody optimization
against SARS-CoV-2.

Result: MCIB在不依赖捷径学习的情况下取得了最佳性能。

Conclusion: 改进模态融合策略和消除捷径信号对多模态讽刺检测至关重要，MCIB为此提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal sarcasm detection is a complex task that requires distinguishing
subtle complementary signals across modalities while filtering out irrelevant
information. Many advanced methods rely on learning shortcuts from datasets
rather than extracting intended sarcasm-related features. However, our
experiments show that shortcut learning impairs the model's generalization in
real-world scenarios. Furthermore, we reveal the weaknesses of current modality
fusion strategies for multimodal sarcasm detection through systematic
experiments, highlighting the necessity of focusing on effective modality
fusion for complex emotion recognition. To address these challenges, we
construct MUStARD++$^{R}$ by removing shortcut signals from MUStARD++. Then, a
Multimodal Conditional Information Bottleneck (MCIB) model is introduced to
enable efficient multimodal fusion for sarcasm detection. Experimental results
show that the MCIB achieves the best performance without relying on shortcut
learning.

Result: 在14个基准数据集上，SPHENIC比现有最优方法性能提升3.31%-6.54%。

Conclusion: SPHENIC通过改进拓扑学习和空间嵌入优化，显著提升了空间转录组聚类的效果。

Abstract: By incorporating spatial location information, spatial-transcriptomics
clustering yields more comprehensive insights into cell subpopulation
identification. Despite recent progress, existing methods have at least two
limitations: (i) topological learning typically considers only representations
of individual cells or their interaction graphs; however, spatial
transcriptomic profiles are often noisy, making these approaches vulnerable to
low-quality topological signals, and (ii) insufficient modeling of spatial
neighborhood information leads to low-quality spatial embeddings. To address
these limitations, we propose SPHENIC, a novel Spatial Persistent Homology
Enhanced Neighborhood Integrative Clustering method. Specifically, SPHENIC
incorporates invariant topological features into the clustering network to
achieve stable representation learning. Additionally, to construct high-quality
spatial embeddings that reflect the true cellular distribution, we design the
Spatial Constraint and Distribution Optimization Module (SCDOM). This module
increases the similarity between a cell's embedding and those of its spatial
neighbors, decreases similarity with non-neighboring cells, and thereby
produces clustering-friendly spatial embeddings. Extensive experiments on 14
benchmark spatial transcriptomic slices demonstrate that SPHENIC achieves
superior performance on the spatial clustering task, outperforming existing
state-of-the-art methods by 3.31%-6.54% over the best alternative.

Abstract: Land cover, both present and future, has a significant effect on several
important Earth system processes. For example, impervious surfaces heat up and
speed up surface water runoff and reduce groundwater infiltration, with
concomitant effects on regional hydrology and flood risk. While regional Earth
System models have increasing skill at forecasting hydrologic and atmospheric
processes at high resolution in future climate scenarios, our ability to
forecast land-use and land-cover change (LULC), a critical input to risk and
consequences assessment for these scenarios, has lagged behind. In this paper,
we propose a new paradigm exploiting Generative AI (GenAI) for land cover
change forecasting by framing LULC forecasting as a data synthesis problem
conditioned on historical and auxiliary data-sources. We discuss desirable
properties of generative models that fundament our research premise, and
demonstrate the feasibility of our methodology through experiments on
imperviousness forecasting using historical data covering the entire
conterminous United States. Specifically, we train a diffusion model for
decadal forecasting of imperviousness and compare its performance to a baseline
that assumes no change at all. Evaluation across 12 metropolitan areas for a
year held-out during training indicate that for average resolutions $\geq
0.7\times0.7km^2$ our model yields MAE lower than such a baseline. This finding
corroborates that such a generative model can capture spatiotemporal patterns
from historical data that are significant for projecting future change.
Finally, we discuss future research to incorporate auxiliary information on
physical properties about the Earth, as well as supporting simulation of
different scenarios by means of driver variables.

Abstract: We study the problem of learning a neural sampler to generate samples from

$\pi\propto\mathrm{e}^{-U}$ is known up to a normalizing constant, which is an
important task in fields such as statistical physics, machine learning,

MDNS through extensive experiments on various distributions with distinct
statistical properties, where MDNS learns to accurately sample from the target
distributions despite the extremely high problem dimensions and outperforms
other learning-based baselines by a large margin. A comprehensive study of
ablations and extensions is also provided to demonstrate the efficacy and
potential of the proposed framework.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于设备部署规模大、补丁延迟（平均补丁时间超过60天），现有防御措施（如主机补丁和网络过滤）在可扩展性、兼容性和部署过程中存在问题。

Method: REFN通过强化学习（RL）驱动在线网络奖励训练LLM，结合知识蒸馏和在线验证，生成兼容且稳健的网络过滤器。

Conclusion: REFN为利用LLM快速预防大规模漏洞利用提供了初步解决方案。

Abstract: The exploitation of 1 day or n day vulnerabilities poses severe threats to
networked devices due to massive deployment scales and delayed patching
(average Mean Time To Patch exceeds 60 days). Existing defenses, including host
based patching and network based filtering, are inadequate due to limited
scalability across diverse devices, compatibility issues especially with
embedded or legacy systems, and error prone deployment process (manual patch
validation). To address these issues, we introduce REFN (Reinforcement Learning
From Network), a novel framework that trains Large Language Models (LLMs) to
autonomously generate network filters to prevent 1 day or n day exploitations.
REFN ensures scalability by uniquely employs Reinforcement Learning (RL) driven
by online network rewards instead of traditional Human Feedback (RLHF). REFN
guarantees compatibility via unified deployment on edge security gateways
(Amazon Eero). REFN provides robustness via online validation using real
network traffic. Crucially, REFN addresses three core challenges in training
LLMs for exploit prevention: 1) expanding current LLMs limited vulnerability
fixing expertise via Agentic RAG based Knowledge Distillation, 2) bridging
current LLMs language to network gaps through an RL From VNF Pipeline that
translates language context (vulnerability description) into network
enforcement, 3) addressing the LLM hallucination and non determinism via the

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种基于GPU的天线仿真框架，用于机器学习应用中的天线设计与优化，并与商业EM软件结果对比。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器学习方法需要大量训练数据，但电磁仿真计算复杂度高，难以快速生成足够样本。

Method: 利用GPU加速开源EM仿真软件（gprMax），生成大量天线仿真数据集，并比较不同机器学习模型的性能。

Result: 入门级GPU性能显著优于高端CPU，高端游戏GPU性能可达高端CPU的18倍；开源软件在足够精细的空间分辨率下与商业软件结果相似。

Conclusion: GPU加速的开源EM仿真框架能高效生成训练数据，为天线设计与优化的机器学习应用提供支持。

Abstract: This study proposes an antenna simulation framework powered by graphics
processing units (GPUs) based on an open-source electromagnetic (EM) simulation
software (gprMax) for machine learning applications of antenna design and
optimization. Furthermore, it compares the simulation results with those
obtained through commercial EM software. The proposed software framework for
machine learning and surrogate model applications will produce antenna data
sets consisting of a large number of antenna simulation results using GPUs.
Although machine learning methods can attain the optimum solutions for many
problems, they are known to be data-hungry and require a great deal of samples
for the training stage of the algorithms. However, producing a sufficient
number of training samples in EM applications within a limited time is
challenging due to the high computational complexity of EM simulations.
Therefore, GPUs are utilized in this study to simulate a large number of
antennas with predefined or random antenna shape parameters to produce data
sets. Moreover, this study also compares various machine learning and deep
learning models in terms of antenna parameter estimation performance. This
study demonstrates that an entry-level GPU substantially outperforms a high-end
CPU in terms of computational performance, while a high-end gaming GPU can
achieve around 18 times more computational performance compared to a high-end
CPU. Moreover, it is shown that the open-source EM simulation software can
deliver similar results to those obtained via commercial software in the
simulation of microstrip antennas when the spatial resolution of the
simulations is sufficiently fine.

<details>

Motivation: 现有PFL方法对非IID数据脆弱，影响集体泛化和个性化效果。

Method: 使用冻结基础模型提取特征，开发双流分析模型（共享主流和专用细化流）实现泛化与个性化。

Result: APFL在多种数据集上表现优于基线方法，准确率提升1.10%-15.45%。

Conclusion: APFL具有异构不变性，能有效解决非IID数据问题，提升个性化联邦学习性能。

Abstract: Personalized Federated Learning (PFL) has presented a significant challenge
to deliver personalized models to individual clients through collaborative
training. Existing PFL methods are often vulnerable to non-IID data, which
severely hinders collective generalization and then compromises the subsequent
personalization efforts. In this paper, to address this non-IID issue in PFL,
we propose an Analytic Personalized Federated Learning (APFL) approach via
dual-stream least squares. In our APFL, we use a foundation model as a frozen
backbone for feature extraction. Subsequent to the feature extractor, we
develop dual-stream analytic models to achieve both collective generalization
and individual personalization. Specifically, our APFL incorporates a shared
primary stream for global generalization across all clients, and a dedicated
refinement stream for local personalization of each individual client. The
analytical solutions of our APFL enable its ideal property of heterogeneity
invariance, theoretically meaning that each personalized model remains
identical regardless of how heterogeneous the data are distributed across all
other clients. Empirical results across various datasets also validate the
superiority of our APFL over state-of-the-art baselines, with advantages of at
least 1.10%-15.45% in accuracy.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了在强化学习中采用Pass@k作为奖励对探索能力的影响，并提出了一种高效的训练方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RLVR使用Pass@1作为奖励，导致策略偏向保守行为，陷入局部最优。Pass@k与探索能力的关系尚未被充分研究。

Method: 采用Pass@k作为奖励训练策略模型（Pass@k Training），并通过解析推导优化训练过程。

Result: Pass@k Training提升了探索能力，且探索与利用可以相互促进。解析推导表明可直接设计优势函数。

Conclusion: Pass@k Training为RLVR提供了一种高效方法，优势函数设计是未来潜在研究方向。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR), which typically adopts
Pass@1 as the reward, has faced the issues in balancing exploration and
exploitation, causing policies to prefer conservative actions, converging to a
local optimum. Identifying an appropriate reward metric is therefore crucial.
Regarding the prior work, although Pass@k has been used in evaluation, its
connection to LLM exploration ability in RLVR remains largely overlooked. To
investigate this, we first use Pass@k as the reward to train the policy model
(i.e., $\textbf{Pass@k Training}$), and observe the improvement on its
exploration ability. Next, we derive an analytical solution for the advantage
of Pass@k Training, leading to an efficient and effective process. Building on
this, our analysis reveals that exploration and exploitation are not inherently
conflicting objectives, while they can mutually enhance each other. Moreover,
Pass@k Training with analytical derivation essentially involves directly
designing the advantage function. Inspired by this, we preliminarily explore
the advantage design for RLVR, showing promising results and highlighting a
potential future direction.

Abstract: Unlocking the potential of transformers on datasets of large physical systems
depends on overcoming the quadratic scaling of the attention mechanism. This
work explores combining the Erwin architecture with the Native Sparse Attention
(NSA) mechanism to improve the efficiency and receptive field of transformer
models for large-scale physical systems, addressing the challenge of quadratic
attention complexity. We adapt the NSA mechanism for non-sequential data,
implement the Erwin NSA model, and evaluate it on three datasets from the
physical sciences -- cosmology simulations, molecular dynamics, and air
pressure modeling -- achieving performance that matches or exceeds that of the
original Erwin model. Additionally, we reproduce the experimental results from
the Erwin paper to validate their implementation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有三维生成模型因蛋白质-配体复合物数据稀缺而难以学习可迁移的几何先验，导致过拟合训练集偏差。

Method: 采用PAC-Bayesian信息瓶颈理论量化样本信息密度，结合Scaffold Hopping任务提升模型能力，保留TargetDiff架构并通过L-BFGS优化细化构象。

Result: 零样本对接成功率从53%提升至64%，Vina评分从-7.41 kcal mol^{-1}优化至-8.07 kcal mol^{-1}，QED提升25%，并显著降低外推误差。

Conclusion: IBEX通过信息瓶颈理论和优化策略，显著提升了药物设计中的生成性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Three-dimensional generative models increasingly drive structure-based drug
discovery, yet it remains constrained by the scarce publicly available
protein-ligand complexes. Under such data scarcity, almost all existing
pipelines struggle to learn transferable geometric priors and consequently
overfit to training-set biases. As such, we present IBEX, an
Information-Bottleneck-EXplored coarse-to-fine pipeline to tackle the chronic
shortage of protein-ligand complex data in structure-based drug design.
Specifically, we use PAC-Bayesian information-bottleneck theory to quantify the
information density of each sample. This analysis reveals how different masking
strategies affect generalization and indicates that, compared with conventional
de novo generation, the constrained Scaffold Hopping task endows the model with
greater effective capacity and improved transfer performance. IBEX retains the
original TargetDiff architecture and hyperparameters for training to generate
molecules compatible with the binding pocket; it then applies an L-BFGS
optimization step to finely refine each conformation by optimizing five
physics-based terms and adjusting six translational and rotational degrees of
freedom in under one second. With only these modifications, IBEX raises the
zero-shot docking success rate on CBGBench CrossDocked2020-based from 53% to
64%, improves the mean Vina score from $-7.41 kcal mol^{-1}$ to $-8.07 kcal
mol^{-1}$, and achieves the best median Vina energy in 57 of 100 pockets versus
3 for the original TargetDiff. IBEX also increases the QED by 25%, achieves
state-of-the-art validity and diversity, and markedly reduces extrapolation
error.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图神经网络（GNN）异常检测方法可能放大训练数据中的偏见，导致不公平结果，而现有公平性研究多针对节点分类任务，缺乏对自动编码器结构的关注。

Method: 提出DECAF-GAD框架，使用结构因果模型（SCM）解耦敏感属性，设计专用自动编码器架构和公平性损失函数。

Result: 实验表明，DECAF-GAD在异常检测性能和公平性指标上均优于基线方法。

Conclusion: DECAF-GAD有效解决了图异常检测中的公平性问题，同时保持了高性能。

Abstract: Graph anomaly detection (GAD) has become an increasingly important task
across various domains. With the rapid development of graph neural networks
(GNNs), GAD methods have achieved significant performance improvements.
However, fairness considerations in GAD remain largely underexplored. Indeed,
GNN-based GAD models can inherit and amplify biases present in training data,
potentially leading to unfair outcomes. While existing efforts have focused on
developing fair GNNs, most approaches target node classification tasks, where
models often rely on simple layer architectures rather than autoencoder-based
structures, which are the most widely used architecturs for anomaly detection.
To address fairness in autoencoder-based GAD models, we propose
\textbf{D}is\textbf{E}ntangled \textbf{C}ounterfactual \textbf{A}dversarial
\textbf{F}air (DECAF)-GAD, a framework that alleviates bias while preserving
GAD performance. Specifically, we introduce a structural causal model (SCM) to
disentangle sensitive attributes from learned representations. Based on this
causal framework, we formulate a specialized autoencoder architecture along
with a fairness-guided loss function. Through extensive experiments on both
synthetic and real-world datasets, we demonstrate that DECAF-GAD not only
achieves competitive anomaly detection performance but also significantly
enhances fairness metrics compared to baseline GAD methods. Our code is

Motivation: 现实应用（如医疗和推荐系统）中的多臂老虎机问题通常具有非平稳动态，传统算法难以应对。

Method: 提出RMAB算法，结合滑动窗口强化学习和UCB机制，学习动态变化。

Result: 算法实现了$\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(N^2 B^{\frac{1}{4}} T^{\frac{3}{4}})$的遗憾界。

Conclusion: RMAB为非平稳RMAB问题提供了首个理论框架，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Online restless multi-armed bandits (RMABs) typically assume that each arm
follows a stationary Markov Decision Process (MDP) with fixed state transitions
and rewards. However, in real-world applications like healthcare and
recommendation systems, these assumptions often break due to non-stationary
dynamics, posing significant challenges for traditional RMAB algorithms. In
this work, we specifically consider $N$-armd RMAB with non-stationary
transition constrained by bounded variation budgets $B$. Our proposed \rmab\;
algorithm integrates sliding window reinforcement learning (RL) with an upper
confidence bound (UCB) mechanism to simultaneously learn transition dynamics
and their variations. We further establish that \rmab\; achieves
$\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(N^2 B^{\frac{1}{4}} T^{\frac{3}{4}})$ regret bound by
leveraging a relaxed definition of regret, providing a foundational theoretical
framework for non-stationary RMAB problems for the first time.

Result: 研究结果为在线GP算法选择合适标准提供了实用指南。

Conclusion: 本文为在线GP算法的数据点缩减提供了统一比较和实用建议。

Abstract: Gaussian Processes (GPs) are widely used for regression and system
identification due to their flexibility and ability to quantify uncertainty.
However, their computational complexity limits their applicability to small
datasets. Moreover in a streaming scenario, more and more datapoints accumulate
which is intractable even for Sparse GPs. Online GPs aim to alleviate this
problem by e.g. defining a maximum budget of datapoints and removing redundant
datapoints. This work provides a unified comparison of several reduction
criteria, analyzing both their computational complexity and reduction behavior.
The criteria are evaluated on benchmark functions and real-world datasets,
including dynamic system identification tasks. Additionally, acceptance
criteria are proposed to further filter out redundant datapoints. This work
yields practical guidelines for choosing a suitable criterion for an online GP
algorithm.

Abstract: Memory is fundamental to intelligence, enabling learning, reasoning, and
adaptability across biological and artificial systems. While Transformer
architectures excel at sequence modeling, they face critical limitations in
long-range context retention, continual learning, and knowledge integration.
This review presents a unified framework bridging neuroscience principles,
including dynamic multi-timescale memory, selective attention, and
consolidation, with engineering advances in Memory-Augmented Transformers. We
organize recent progress through three taxonomic dimensions: functional
objectives (context extension, reasoning, knowledge integration, adaptation),
memory representations (parameter-encoded, state-based, explicit, hybrid), and
integration mechanisms (attention fusion, gated control, associative
retrieval). Our analysis of core memory operations (reading, writing,
forgetting, and capacity management) reveals a shift from static caches toward
adaptive, test-time learning systems. We identify persistent challenges in
scalability and interference, alongside emerging solutions including
hierarchical buffering and surprise-gated updates. This synthesis provides a
roadmap toward cognitively-inspired, lifelong-learning Transformer
architectures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数据最小化（DM）是数据保护法规的核心原则，但在机器学习（ML）应用中缺乏统一的研究框架，导致实践者难以理解和实施。

Method: 引入了一个综合框架，包括统一的数据流程、对手模型和最小化点，并系统回顾了相关文献。

Result: 提供了一个结构化的DMML概述，帮助实践者和研究者更有效地应用数据最小化原则。

Conclusion: 该框架促进了数据最小化策略在AI/ML领域的统一理解和广泛应用。

Abstract: Data minimization (DM) describes the principle of collecting only the data
strictly necessary for a given task. It is a foundational principle across
major data protection regulations like GDPR and CPRA. Violations of this
principle have substantial real-world consequences, with regulatory actions
resulting in fines reaching hundreds of millions of dollars. Notably, the
relevance of data minimization is particularly pronounced in machine learning
(ML) applications, which typically rely on large datasets, resulting in an
emerging research area known as Data Minimization in Machine Learning (DMML).
At the same time, existing work on other ML privacy and security topics often
addresses concerns relevant to DMML without explicitly acknowledging the
connection. This disconnect leads to confusion among practitioners,
complicating their efforts to implement DM principles and interpret the
terminology, metrics, and evaluation criteria used across different research
communities. To address this gap, our work introduces a comprehensive framework
for DMML, including a unified data pipeline, adversaries, and points of
minimization. This framework allows us to systematically review the literature
on data minimization and \emph{DM-adjacent} methodologies, for the first time
presenting a structured overview designed to help practitioners and researchers
effectively apply DM principles. Our work facilitates a unified DM-centric
understanding and broader adoption of data minimization strategies in AI/ML.

Conclusion: 该方法不仅适用于数据属性验证，还可推广到其他线性函数验证任务。

Abstract: Data attribution methods aim to answer useful counterfactual questions like
"what would a ML model's prediction be if it were trained on a different
dataset?" However, estimation of data attribution models through techniques
like empirical influence or "datamodeling" remains very computationally
expensive. This causes a critical trust issue: if only a few computationally
rich parties can obtain data attributions, how can resource-constrained parties
trust that the provided attributions are indeed "good," especially when they
are used for important downstream applications (e.g., data pricing)? In this
paper, we address this trust issue by proposing an interactive verification
paradigm for data attribution. An untrusted and computationally powerful Prover
learns data attributions, and then engages in an interactive proof with a
resource-constrained Verifier. Our main result is a protocol that provides
formal completeness, soundness, and efficiency guarantees in the sense of
Probably-Approximately-Correct (PAC) verification. Specifically, if both Prover
and Verifier follow the protocol, the Verifier accepts data attributions that
are {\epsilon}-close to the optimal data attributions (in terms of the Mean
Squared Error) with probability 1-{\delta}. Conversely, if the Prover
arbitrarily deviates from the protocol, even with infinite compute, then this
is detected (or it still yields data attributions to the Verifier) except with
probability {\delta}. Importantly, our protocol ensures the Verifier's
workload, measured by the number of independent model retrainings it must
perform, scales only as O(1/{\epsilon}); i.e., independently of the dataset
size. At a technical level, our results apply to efficiently verifying any
linear function over the boolean hypercube computed by the Prover, making them
broadly applicable to various attribution tasks.

Motivation: AI驱动的药物设计缺乏实验先验知识，可能导致设计的分子违反隐含约束（如致突变性），因此需要构建包含先验知识的数据集。

Method: 使用LLM管道从文献中提取化合物信息，构建包含3200万对自然语言事实和实体表示的数据集\ourdataset，并训练LLM、CLIP和LLava架构进行联合推理。

Conclusion: \ourdataset为药物设计提供了有效的先验知识，显著提升了模型性能，并公开了数据集以促进进一步研究。

Abstract: AI-driven discovery can greatly reduce design time and enhance new
therapeutics' effectiveness. Models using simulators explore broad design
spaces but risk violating implicit constraints due to a lack of experimental
priors. For example, in a new analysis we performed on a diverse set of models
on the GuacaMol benchmark using supervised classifiers, over 60\% of molecules
proposed had high probability of being mutagenic. In this work, we introduce
\ourdataset, a dataset of priors for design problems extracted from literature
describing compounds used in lab settings. It is constructed with LLM pipelines
for discovering therapeutic entities in relevant paragraphs and summarizing
information in concise fair-use facts. \ourdataset~ consists of 32.3 million
pairs of natural language facts, and appropriate entity representations (i.e.
SMILES or refseq IDs). To demonstrate the potential of the data, we train LLM,
CLIP, and LLava architectures to reason jointly about text and design targets
and evaluate on tasks from the Therapeutic Data Commons (TDC). \ourdataset~is
highly effective for creating models with strong priors: in supervised
prediction problems that use our data as pretraining, our best models with 15M
learnable parameters outperform larger 2B TxGemma on both regression and
classification TDC tasks, and perform comparably to 9B models on average.
Models built with \ourdataset~can be used as constraints while optimizing for
novel molecules in GuacaMol, resulting in proposals that are safer and nearly
as effective. We release our dataset at
\href{https://huggingface.co/datasets/medexanon/Medex}{huggingface.co/datasets/medexanon/Medex},
and will provide expanded versions as available literature grows.

Conclusion: 集成方法有效利用了两种模型的互补优势，提升了复杂条件下的检测性能，并通过定性分析验证了其鲁棒性。

Abstract: Audiovisual active speaker detection (ASD) in egocentric recordings is
challenged by frequent occlusions, motion blur, and audio interference, which
undermine the discernability of temporal synchrony between lip movement and
speech. Traditional synchronisation-based systems perform well under clean
conditions but degrade sharply in first-person recordings. Conversely,
face-voice association (FVA)-based methods forgo synchronisation modelling in
favour of cross-modal biometric matching, exhibiting robustness to transient
visual corruption but suffering when overlapping speech or front-end
segmentation errors occur. In this paper, a simple yet effective ensemble
approach is proposed to fuse synchronisation-dependent and
synchronisation-agnostic model outputs via weighted averaging, thereby
harnessing complementary cues without introducing complex fusion architectures.
A refined preprocessing pipeline for the FVA-based component is also introduced
to optimise ensemble integration. Experiments on the Ego4D-AVD validation set
demonstrate that the ensemble attains 70.2% and 66.7% mean Average Precision
(mAP) with TalkNet and Light-ASD backbones, respectively. A qualitative
analysis stratified by face image quality and utterance masking prevalence
further substantiates the complementary strengths of each component.

Abstract: Item information, such as titles and attributes, is essential for effective
user engagement in e-commerce. However, manual or semi-manual entry of
structured item specifics often produces inconsistent quality, errors, and slow
turnaround, especially for Customer-to-Customer sellers. Generating accurate
descriptions directly from item images offers a promising alternative. Existing
retrieval-based solutions address some of these issues but often miss
fine-grained visual details and struggle with niche or specialized categories.
  We propose Optimized Preference-Based AI for Listings (OPAL), a framework for
generating schema-compliant, high-quality item descriptions from images using a
fine-tuned multimodal large language model (MLLM). OPAL addresses key
challenges in multimodal e-commerce applications, including bridging modality
gaps and capturing detailed contextual information. It introduces two data
refinement methods: MLLM-Assisted Conformity Enhancement, which ensures
alignment with structured schema requirements, and LLM-Assisted Contextual
Understanding, which improves the capture of nuanced and fine-grained
information from visual inputs.
  OPAL uses visual instruction tuning combined with direct preference
optimization to fine-tune the MLLM, reducing hallucinations and improving
robustness across different backbone architectures. We evaluate OPAL on
real-world e-commerce datasets, showing that it consistently outperforms
baseline methods in both description quality and schema completion rates. These
results demonstrate that OPAL effectively bridges the gap between visual and
textual modalities, delivering richer, more accurate, and more consistent item
descriptions. This work advances automated listing optimization and supports
scalable, high-quality content generation in e-commerce platforms.

Abstract: Accessing suitable datasets is critical for research and development in
recommender systems. However, finding datasets that match specific
recommendation task or domains remains a challenge due to scattered sources and
inconsistent metadata. To address this gap, we propose a community-driven and
explainable dataset search engine tailored for recommender system research. Our
system supports semantic search across multiple dataset attributes, such as
dataset names, descriptions, and recommendation domain, and provides
explanations of search relevance to enhance transparency. The system encourages
community participation by allowing users to contribute standardized dataset
metadata in public repository. By improving dataset discoverability and search
interpretability, the system facilitates more efficient research reproduction.
The platform is publicly available at: https://ds4rs.com.

*Michael Weiss,Robert Rosenbach,Christian Eggenberger*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 比较优化点击率（CTR）与订单提交率（OSR）对电商业务的影响，发现优化OSR能显著提升GMV。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨不同优化目标（CTR与OSR）对电商业务指标（如GMV）的实际影响。

Method: 通过在线A/B测试比较优化CTR和OSR的效果。

Result: 优化OSR使GMV提升超过优化CTR的五倍，且不影响新产品发现。

Conclusion: 优化OSR更直接促进业务目标，同时揭示了不同目标下的特征重要性差异。

Abstract: Ranking product recommendations to optimize for a high click-through rate
(CTR) or for high conversion, such as add-to-cart rate (ACR) and
Order-Submit-Rate (OSR, view-to-purchase conversion) are standard practices in
e-commerce. Optimizing for CTR appears like a straightforward choice: Training
data (i.e., click data) are simple to collect and often available in large
quantities. Additionally, CTR is used far beyond e-commerce, making it a
generalist, easily implemented option. ACR and OSR, on the other hand, are more
directly linked to a shop's business goals, such as the Gross Merchandise Value
(GMV). In this paper, we compare the effects of using either of these
objectives using an online A/B test. Among our key findings, we demonstrate
that in our shops, optimizing for OSR produces a GMV uplift more than five
times larger than when optimizing for CTR, without sacrificing new product
discovery. Our results also provide insights into the different feature
importances for each of the objectives.

### [292] [Proxy Model-Guided Reinforcement Learning for Client Selection in Federated Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10401)
*Liang Qu,Jianxin Li,Wei Yuan,Penghui Ruan,Yuhui Shi,Hongzhi Yin*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 论文提出ProxyRL-FRS框架，通过代理模型和强化学习优化联邦推荐系统中的客户端选择策略，解决数据异质性和稀疏性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有联邦推荐系统采用随机客户端选择策略，忽视了用户数据的统计异质性，导致模型性能不佳。需要针对推荐场景的独特挑战（如贡献评估成本高、稀疏更新）设计专用方法。

Method: 提出ProxyRL-FRS框架：1) 在客户端部署双分支模型ProxyNCF，提供轻量级贡献评估；2) 设计基于强化学习的客户端选择策略，平衡推荐准确性和嵌入新鲜度。

Result: 在公共推荐数据集上的实验验证了ProxyRL-FRS的有效性。

Conclusion: ProxyRL-FRS通过代理模型和强化学习优化客户端选择，显著提升了联邦推荐系统的性能。

Abstract: Federated recommender systems have emerged as a promising privacy-preserving
paradigm, enabling personalized recommendation services without exposing users'
raw data. By keeping data local and relying on a central server to coordinate
training across distributed clients, FedRSs protect user privacy while
collaboratively learning global models. However, most existing FedRS frameworks
adopt fully random client selection strategy in each training round,
overlooking the statistical heterogeneity of user data arising from diverse
preferences and behavior patterns, thereby resulting in suboptimal model
performance. While some client selection strategies have been proposed in the
broader federated learning literature, these methods are typically designed for
generic tasks and fail to address the unique challenges of recommendation
scenarios, such as expensive contribution evaluation due to the large number of
clients, and sparse updates resulting from long-tail item distributions. To
bridge this gap, we propose ProxyRL-FRS, a proxy model-guided reinforcement
learning framework tailored for client selection in federated recommendation.
Specifically, we first introduce ProxyNCF, a dual-branch model deployed on each
client, which augments standard Neural Collaborative Filtering with an
additional proxy model branch that provides lightweight contribution
estimation, thus eliminating the need for expensive per-round local training
traditionally required to evaluate a client's contribution. Furthermore, we
design a staleness-aware SA reinforcement learning agent that selects clients
based on the proxy-estimated contribution, and is guided by a reward function
balancing recommendation accuracy and embedding staleness, thereby enriching
the update coverage of item embeddings. Experiments conducted on public
recommendation datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of ProxyRL-FRS.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 论文探讨了如何为统一生成模型构建通用的语义ID，以同时优化搜索和推荐任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统ID和任务特定的语义ID在统一模型中表现不佳，需要一种能同时适应搜索和推荐的语义ID方案。

Method: 比较了多种构建语义ID的策略，包括任务特定和跨任务方法，并测试了是否应为每个任务分配独立的语义ID。最终采用双编码器模型，在搜索和推荐任务上微调，构建统一的语义ID空间。

Result: 实验表明，基于双编码器模型和统一语义ID空间的方案在搜索和推荐任务中均表现优异。

Conclusion: 研究为通用语义ID的设计提供了有效方案，并启发了未来统一生成推荐架构的探索。

Abstract: Generative models powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) are emerging as a
unified solution for powering both recommendation and search tasks. A key
design choice in these models is how to represent items, traditionally through
unique identifiers (IDs) and more recently with Semantic IDs composed of
discrete codes, obtained from embeddings. While task-specific embedding models
can improve performance for individual tasks, they may not generalize well in a
joint setting. In this paper, we explore how to construct Semantic IDs that
perform well both in search and recommendation when using a unified model. We
compare a range of strategies to construct Semantic IDs, looking into
task-specific and cross-tasks approaches, and also whether each task should
have its own semantic ID tokens in a joint search and recommendation generative
model. Our results show that using a bi-encoder model fine-tuned on both search
and recommendation tasks to obtain item embeddings, followed by the
construction of a unified Semantic ID space provides an effective trade-off,
enabling strong performance in both tasks. We hope these findings spark
follow-up work on generalisable, semantically grounded ID schemes and inform
the next wave of unified generative recommender architectures.

*Krzysztof Daniell,Igor Buzhinsky,Sebastian Björkqvist*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于图变换器的密集检索方法，用于专利搜索，通过图表征发明特征及其关系，显著提高了检索质量和计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 专利搜索因文档数量庞大和需要复杂比较而具有挑战性，因此需要高效的搜索工具。

Method: 使用图变换器处理发明图表，并以专利审查员的引用作为相关性信号进行训练。

Result: 相比公开文本嵌入模型，该方法在检索质量和计算效率上有显著提升。

Conclusion: 该方法能模拟专业审查员的检索方式，提供更高效的专利搜索工具。

Abstract: Finding relevant prior art is crucial when deciding whether to file a new
patent application or invalidate an existing patent. However, searching for
prior art is challenging due to the large number of patent documents and the
need for nuanced comparisons to determine novelty. An accurate search engine is
therefore invaluable for speeding up the process. We present a Graph
Transformer-based dense retrieval method for patent searching where each
invention is represented by a graph describing its features and their
relationships. Our model processes these invention graphs and is trained using
prior art citations from patent office examiners as relevance signals. Using
graphs as input significantly improves the computational efficiency of
processing long documents, while leveraging examiner citations allows the model
to learn domain-specific similarities beyond simple text-based matching. The
result is a search engine that emulates how professional patent examiners
identify relevant documents. We compare our approach against publicly available
text embedding models and show substantial improvements in both prior art
retrieval quality and computational efficiency.

### [295] [DAS: Dual-Aligned Semantic IDs Empowered Industrial Recommender System](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10584)
*Wencai Ye,Mingjie Sun,Shaoyun Shi,Peng Wang,Wenjin Wu,Peng Jiang*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新型的单阶段双对齐语义ID方法（DAS），通过同时优化量化和对齐，解决了传统两阶段方法的信息丢失和对齐策略不灵活的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的语义ID在多模态推荐系统中缺乏协作信号，导致与下游推荐目标不匹配，且传统两阶段对齐方法存在信息丢失和策略不灵活的问题。

Method: DAS方法通过多视图对比对齐和双学习技术，同时优化量化和对齐，包括ID-based CF debias模块和三种对比对齐方法。

Result: DAS在离线和在线A/B测试中表现优异，已在快手App的广告场景中成功部署，每日服务超过4亿用户。

Conclusion: DAS方法有效解决了语义ID对齐中的信息丢失和策略不灵活问题，提升了推荐系统的性能。

Abstract: Semantic IDs are discrete identifiers generated by quantizing the Multi-modal
Large Language Models (MLLMs) embeddings, enabling efficient multi-modal
content integration in recommendation systems. However, their lack of
collaborative signals results in a misalignment with downstream discriminative
and generative recommendation objectives. Recent studies have introduced
various alignment mechanisms to address this problem, but their two-stage
framework design still leads to two main limitations: (1) inevitable
information loss during alignment, and (2) inflexibility in applying adaptive
alignment strategies, consequently constraining the mutual information
maximization during the alignment process. To address these limitations, we
propose a novel and flexible one-stage Dual-Aligned Semantic IDs (DAS) method
that simultaneously optimizes quantization and alignment, preserving semantic
integrity and alignment quality while avoiding the information loss typically
associated with two-stage methods. Meanwhile, DAS achieves more efficient
alignment between the semantic IDs and collaborative signals, with the
following two innovative and effective approaches: (1) Multi-view Constrative
Alignment: To maximize mutual information between semantic IDs and
collaborative signals, we first incorporate an ID-based CF debias module, and
then design three effective contrastive alignment methods: dual user-to-item
(u2i), dual item-to-item/user-to-user (i2i/u2u), and dual co-occurrence
item-to-item/user-to-user (i2i/u2u). (2) Dual Learning: By aligning the dual
quantizations of users and ads, the constructed semantic IDs for users and ads
achieve stronger alignment. Finally, we conduct extensive offline experiments
and online A/B tests to evaluate DAS's effectiveness, which is now successfully
deployed across various advertising scenarios at Kuaishou App, serving over 400
million users daily.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新框架，通过优化注意力机制和移除冗余计算，显著提升了生成推荐模型的效率和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有生成推荐模型存在效率瓶颈，如相对时间注意力偏置的索引操作和查询-键注意力图的计算，影响了训练和推理速度。

Method: 提出Functional Relative Attention Bias和Attention-Free Token Mixer模块，优化注意力机制并移除冗余计算，应用于FuXi-α生成FuXi-β模型。

Result: FuXi-β在多个数据集上表现优于现有模型，NDCG@10指标提升27%至47%，并显著加速。

Conclusion: 新框架有效解决了效率瓶颈，同时保持了模型的扩展性，为生成推荐系统提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Scaling laws for autoregressive generative recommenders reveal potential for
larger, more versatile systems but mean greater latency and training costs. To
accelerate training and inference, we investigated the recent generative
recommendation models HSTU and FuXi-$\alpha$, identifying two efficiency
bottlenecks: the indexing operations in relative temporal attention bias and
the computation of the query-key attention map. Additionally, we observed that
relative attention bias in self-attention mechanisms can also serve as
attention maps. Previous works like Synthesizer have shown that alternative
forms of attention maps can achieve similar performance, naturally raising the
question of whether some attention maps are redundant. Through empirical
experiments, we discovered that using the query-key attention map might degrade
the model's performance in recommendation tasks. To address these bottlenecks,
we propose a new framework applicable to Transformer-like recommendation
models. On one hand, we introduce Functional Relative Attention Bias, which
avoids the time-consuming operations of the original relative attention bias,
thereby accelerating the process. On the other hand, we remove the query-key
attention map from the original self-attention layer and design a new
Attention-Free Token Mixer module. Furthermore, by applying this framework to
FuXi-$\alpha$, we introduce a new model, FuXi-$\beta$. Experiments across
multiple datasets demonstrate that FuXi-$\beta$ outperforms previous
state-of-the-art models and achieves significant acceleration compared to
FuXi-$\alpha$, while also adhering to the scaling law. Notably, FuXi-$\beta$
shows an improvement of 27% to 47% in the NDCG@10 metric on large-scale
industrial datasets compared to FuXi-$\alpha$. Our code is available in a
public repository: https://github.com/USTC-StarTeam/FuXi-beta

TL;DR: HPMRec是一个基于超复数嵌入的多模态推荐框架，通过非线性跨模态交互和提示感知补偿机制解决现有方法的局限性，提升推荐性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态推荐方法存在单表示能力有限、线性模态融合忽略非线性相关性以及静态优化无法动态缓解GCN过平滑问题。

Method: HPMRec利用超复数嵌入增强多模态特征多样性，通过超复数乘法建立非线性跨模态交互，并引入提示感知补偿机制缓解过平滑问题。

Result: 在四个公开数据集上的实验表明，HPMRec实现了最先进的推荐性能。

Conclusion: HPMRec通过创新方法有效解决了多模态推荐中的关键挑战，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Modern recommender systems face critical challenges in handling information
overload while addressing the inherent limitations of multimodal representation
learning. Existing methods suffer from three fundamental limitations: (1)
restricted ability to represent rich multimodal features through a single
representation, (2) existing linear modality fusion strategies ignore the deep
nonlinear correlations between modalities, and (3) static optimization methods
failing to dynamically mitigate the over-smoothing problem in graph
convolutional network (GCN). To overcome these limitations, we propose HPMRec,
a novel Hypercomplex Prompt-aware Multimodal Recommendation framework, which
utilizes hypercomplex embeddings in the form of multi-components to enhance the
representation diversity of multimodal features. HPMRec adopts the hypercomplex
multiplication to naturally establish nonlinear cross-modality interactions to
bridge semantic gaps, which is beneficial to explore the cross-modality
features. HPMRec also introduces the prompt-aware compensation mechanism to aid
the misalignment between components and modality-specific features loss, and
this mechanism fundamentally alleviates the over-smoothing problem. It further
designs self-supervised learning tasks that enhance representation diversity
and align different modalities. Extensive experiments on four public datasets
show that HPMRec achieves state-of-the-art recommendation performance.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: CrossDenoise是一种轻量级框架，通过分解噪声估计为用户、项目和交互特定因素，显著提升推荐系统的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 隐式反馈中的噪声（如假阳性和假阴性）严重影响推荐准确性，现有去噪方法存在计算开销大或超参数调整复杂等问题。

Method: CrossDenoise通过基于排名的线性映射计算实体声誉因子（用户/项目可靠性），并结合交互级权重（基于ECDF），设计轻量且模型无关。

Result: 在多个数据集和模型上，CrossDenoise显著优于现有方法，例如在Yelp上NDCG@50提升27.01%，且计算开销极低。

Conclusion: CrossDenoise有效分离噪声样本，具有鲁棒性和可扩展性，为隐式反馈去噪提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Recommender systems heavily rely on implicit feedback, which is inherently
noisy due to false positives and negatives, severely degrading recommendation
accuracy. Existing denoising strategies often overlook entity-aware modeling,
suffer from high computational overhead, or demand excessive hyperparameter
tuning, limiting their real-world applicability. We propose CrossDenoise, a
novel and lightweight framework that addresses these challenges by
disentangling noise estimation into user-, item-, and interaction-specific
factors. Leveraging empirical observations that show significant heterogeneity
in user and item noise propensities, CrossDenoise computes entity reputation
factors (user/item reliability) via a rank-based linear mapping of average
training losses. These are fused with interaction-level weights derived from an
empirical cumulative distribution function (ECDF) of individual losses. This
design is model-agnostic, computationally efficient, and requires only two
intuitive hyperparameters. Extensive experiments on ML-1M, Yelp, and
Amazon-book datasets, across GMF, NeuMF, and CDAE backbones, demonstrate that
CrossDenoise consistently and significantly outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines. For instance, it achieves up to 27.01% NDCG@50 gain on Yelp with
NeuMF, while incurring negligible computational and memory overhead. Our
analysis confirms that CrossDenoise effectively separates clean from noisy
samples and remains robust under varied hyperparameter settings. It offers a
practical and scalable solution for denoising implicit feedback.

TL;DR: FormalGrad通过将形式化方法融入LLM代码生成循环，利用伪梯度指导模型迭代优化，显著提升了代码的正确性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM生成的代码常缺乏正确性、鲁棒性和效率的保证，尤其在需要严格约束的领域问题突出。

Method: FormalGrad将代码视为可微分变量，将形式化约束转化为伪梯度，指导LLM迭代优化生成结果。

Result: 在HumanEval和LiveCodeBench基准测试中，性能分别提升27%和41%，生成代码具有形式化验证的鲁棒性和高效性。

Conclusion: FormalGrad为高风险应用中的AI辅助软件开发提供了可靠解决方案。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities
in code generation, they often produce solutions that lack guarantees of
correctness, robustness, and efficiency. The limitation is acute in domains
requiring strict constraints. FormalGrad introduces a principled framework that
integrates formal methods directly into an iterative LLM-based generation loop.
It uniquely treats code as a differentiable variable, converting structured
feedback and formal constraints into a textual pseudo-gradient. This gradient
guides the model to iteratively refine solutions, ensuring they are not only
functional but also robust and formally justified. We evaluate FormalGrad on
the HumanEval, HumanEval+, and LiveCodeBench benchmarks. Our implementation
outperforms strong baselines, achieving an absolute improvement of up to 27% on
HumanEval and a 41% relative improvement on the challenging LiveCodeBench V6.
FormalGrad generates formally justified code that is robust and efficient,
paving the way for reliable AI-assisted software development in high-stakes
applications.

TL;DR: Saracoder通过分层特征优化框架解决了RAG在代码补全中的语义误导、冗余和同质性问题，并引入外部符号消歧模块提升准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG方法在代码补全中依赖文本相似性，导致语义误导、冗余和同质性问题，且无法解决外部符号歧义。

Method: Saracoder采用分层特征优化模块，通过语义关系提炼、重复修剪、基于图的结构相似性评估和结果重排；同时引入外部感知标识符消歧模块。

Result: 在CrossCodeEval和RepoEval-Updated基准测试中，Saracoder显著优于现有基线。

Conclusion: 多维度系统优化检索结果为构建更准确、鲁棒的代码补全系统提供了新范式。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for repository-level code completion
commonly relies on superficial text similarity, leading to results plagued by
semantic misguidance, redundancy, and homogeneity, while also failing to
resolve external symbol ambiguity. To address these challenges, we introduce
Saracoder, a Hierarchical Feature-Optimized retrieval framework. Its core
Hierarchical Feature Optimization module systematically refines candidates by
distilling deep semantic relationships, pruning exact duplicates, assessing
structural similarity with a novel graph-based metric that weighs edits by
their topological importance, and reranking results to maximize both relevance
and diversity. Furthermore, an External-Aware Identifier Disambiguator module
accurately resolves cross-file symbol ambiguity via dependency analysis.
Extensive experiments on the challenging CrossCodeEval and RepoEval-Updated
benchmarks demonstrate that Saracoder significantly outperforms existing
baselines across multiple programming languages and models. Our work proves
that systematically refining retrieval results across multiple dimensions
provides a new paradigm for building more accurate and robust repository-level
code completion systems.

Motivation: 现有的AI编程助手（如低延迟代码补全和基于聊天的编辑）存在局限性，无法主动预测开发者的一系列相关编辑，导致用户体验不佳。

Method: 研究团队构建了一个高质量的监督微调数据集和评估基准，并对一系列模型进行了监督微调，进行了全面评估。

Result: 实验结果表明，微调后的模型在预测开发者下一步编辑方面表现优于基线模型。

Conclusion: 该研究为一种新的交互范式奠定了基础，使AI助手能够主动预测开发者行为，而不仅仅是对显式指令做出反应。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has led to the
widespread adoption of AI-powered coding assistants integrated into a
development environment. On one hand, low-latency code completion offers
completion suggestions but is fundamentally constrained to the cursor's current
position. On the other hand, chat-based editing can perform complex
modifications, yet forces developers to stop their work, describe the intent in
natural language, which causes a context-switch away from the code. This
creates a suboptimal user experience, as neither paradigm proactively predicts
the developer's next edit in a sequence of related edits. To bridge this gap
and provide the seamless code edit suggestion, we introduce the task of Next
Edit Prediction, a novel task designed to infer developer intent from recent
interaction history to predict both the location and content of the subsequent
edit. Specifically, we curate a high-quality supervised fine-tuning dataset and
an evaluation benchmark for the Next Edit Prediction task. Then, we conduct
supervised fine-tuning on a series of models and performed a comprehensive
evaluation of both the fine-tuned models and other baseline models, yielding
several novel findings. This work lays the foundation for a new interaction
paradigm that proactively collaborate with developers by anticipating their
following action, rather than merely reacting to explicit instructions.

TL;DR: 预训练语言模型（PTLM）的开发涉及上游（如GitHub）和下游（如Hugging Face）平台的协作，但存在版本不一致和同步问题。研究发现，两平台的提交活动有不同侧重点，并识别出八种同步模式，揭示了当前跨平台发布实践的碎片化风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究PTLM在GitHub和Hugging Face平台间的开发协调问题，揭示跨平台协作中的挑战及其对模型质量和一致性的影响。

Method: 对325个PTLM家族（904个Hugging Face变体）进行混合方法研究，分析提交活动的协调方式，包括延迟、同步类型和强度三个维度。

Result: 发现GitHub贡献者关注模型版本、代码质量和性能优化，而Hugging Face贡献者关注模型描述和推理设置。识别出八种同步模式，部分同步模式揭示了跨平台发布的碎片化问题。

Conclusion: 当前PTLM跨平台发布实践存在结构性问题，可能导致模型不完整或过时。识别同步模式对改进发布流程的监督和可追溯性至关重要。

Abstract: Pretrained language models (PTLMs) have advanced natural language processing
(NLP), enabling progress in tasks like text generation and translation. Like
software package management, PTLMs are trained using code and environment
scripts in upstream repositories (e.g., GitHub, GH) and distributed as variants
via downstream platforms like Hugging Face (HF). Coordinating development
between GH and HF poses challenges such as misaligned release timelines,
inconsistent versioning, and limited reuse of PTLM variants. We conducted a
mixed-method study of 325 PTLM families (904 HF variants) to examine how commit
activities are coordinated. Our analysis reveals that GH contributors typically
make changes related to specifying the version of the model, improving code
quality, performance optimization, and dependency management within the
training scripts, while HF contributors make changes related to improving model
descriptions, data set handling, and setup required for model inference.
Furthermore, to understand the synchronization aspects of commit activities
between GH and HF, we examined three dimensions of these activities -- lag
(delay), type of synchronization, and intensity -- which together yielded eight
distinct synchronization patterns. The prevalence of partially synchronized
patterns, such as Disperse synchronization and Sparse synchronization, reveals
structural disconnects in current cross-platform release practices. These
patterns often result in isolated changes -- where improvements or fixes made
on one platform are never replicated on the other -- and in some cases,
indicate an abandonment of one repository in favor of the other. Such
fragmentation risks exposing end users to incomplete, outdated, or behaviorally
inconsistent models. Hence, recognizing these synchronization patterns is
critical for improving oversight and traceability in PTLM release workflows.

TL;DR: 论文研究了Solidity版本更新带来的编译错误问题，评估了LLMs在解决这些错误中的表现，并提出了SMCFIXER框架，显著提高了修复准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Solidity频繁的版本更新导致编译错误和迁移问题，亟需有效的解决方案。

Method: 通过实证研究分析编译错误，评估多种LLMs的修复能力，并提出SMCFIXER框架结合专家知识和LLM修复机制。

Result: 81.68%的合约在不同版本编译时出错，SMCFIXER比GPT-4o基线提高了24.24%，达到96.97%的准确率。

Conclusion: SMCFIXER通过结合专家知识和LLM，显著提升了Solidity编译错误的修复效果，为智能合约迁移提供了可靠工具。

Abstract: Solidity, the dominant smart contract language for Ethereum, has rapidly
evolved with frequent version updates to enhance security, functionality, and
developer experience. However, these continual changes introduce significant
challenges, particularly in compilation errors, code migration, and
maintenance. Therefore, we conduct an empirical study to investigate the
challenges in the Solidity version evolution and reveal that 81.68% of examined
contracts encounter errors when compiled across different versions, with 86.92%
of compilation errors.
  To mitigate these challenges, we conducted a systematic evaluation of large
language models (LLMs) for resolving Solidity compilation errors during version
migrations. Our empirical analysis across both open-source (LLaMA3, DeepSeek)
and closed-source (GPT-4o, GPT-3.5-turbo) LLMs reveals that although these
models exhibit error repair capabilities, their effectiveness diminishes
significantly for semantic-level issues and shows strong dependency on prompt
engineering strategies. This underscores the critical need for domain-specific
adaptation in developing reliable LLM-based repair systems for smart contracts.
  Building upon these insights, we introduce SMCFIXER, a novel framework that
systematically integrates expert knowledge retrieval with LLM-based repair
mechanisms for Solidity compilation error resolution. The architecture
comprises three core phases: (1) context-aware code slicing that extracts
relevant error information; (2) expert knowledge retrieval from official
documentation; and (3) iterative patch generation for Solidity migration.
Experimental validation across Solidity version migrations demonstrates our
approach's statistically significant 24.24% improvement over baseline GPT-4o on

Abstract: Long lived software projects encompass a large number of artifacts, which
undergo many revisions throughout their history. Empirical software engineering
researchers studying software evolution gather and collect datasets with
millions of events, representing changes introduced to specific artifacts. In
this paper, we propose EvoScat, a tool that attempts addressing temporal
scalability through the usage of interactive density scatterplot to provide a
global overview of large historical datasets mined from open source
repositories in a single visualization. EvoScat intents to provide researchers
with a mean to produce scalable visualizations that can help them explore and
characterize evolution datasets, as well as comparing the histories of
individual artifacts, both in terms of 1) observing how rapidly different
artifacts age over multiple-year-long time spans 2) how often metrics
associated with each artifacts tend towards an improvement or worsening. The
paper shows how the tool can be tailored to specific analysis needs (pace of
change comparison, clone detection, freshness assessment) thanks to its support
for flexible configuration of history scaling and alignment along the time
axis, artifacts sorting and interactive color mapping, enabling the analysis of
millions of events obtained by mining the histories of tens of thousands of
software artifacts. We include in this paper a gallery showcasing datasets
gathering specific artifacts (OpenAPI descriptions, GitHub workflow
definitions) across multiple repositories, as well as diving into the history
of specific popular open source projects.

### [305] [FPT-Approximability of Stable Matching Problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10129)
*Jiehua Chen,Sanjukta Roy,Sofia Simola*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 研究了稳定匹配相关三个优化问题的参数化近似性，包括最小化阻塞对数、最大化稳定匹配规模等，揭示了其计算复杂性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索稳定匹配问题的参数化近似性，以解决其NP-hard和W[1]-hard的计算困难。

Method: 分析三个问题的计算复杂性，证明其近似难度，并提出针对特定参数的FPT-近似方案。

Result: 前两个问题难以近似，第三个问题针对特定参数提出了FPT-近似方案。

Conclusion: 稳定匹配问题的参数化近似性具有挑战性，但部分问题可通过特定参数实现高效近似。

Abstract: We study parameterized approximability of three optimization problems related
to stable matching: (1) Min-BP-SMI: Given a stable marriage instance and a
number k, find a size-at-least-k matching that minimizes the number $\beta$ of
blocking pairs; (2) Min-BP-SRI: Given a stable roommates instance, find a
matching that minimizes the number $\beta$ of blocking pairs; (3) Max-SMTI:
Given a stable marriage instance with preferences containing ties, find a
maximum-size stable matching.
  The first two problems are known to be NP-hard to approximate to any constant
factor and W[1]-hard with respect to $\beta$, making the existence of an EPTAS
or FPT-algorithms unlikely. We show that they are W[1]-hard with respect to
$\beta$ to approximate to any function of $\beta$. This means that unless
FPT=W[1], there is no FPT-approximation scheme for the parameter $\beta$. The
last problem (Max-SMTI) is known to be NP-hard to approximate to factor-29/33
and W[1]-hard with respect to the number of ties. We complement this and
present an FPT-approximation scheme for the parameter "number of agents with
ties".

Result: 实验表明，该方法在真实场景中可扩展到实际问题规模，并显著优于基线方法，同时通过消融研究验证了对手建模的重要性。

Conclusion: 该研究为对抗性环境中的路由规划提供了一种高效且可扩展的解决方案，强调了随机性和对手建模的关键作用。

Abstract: We consider the problem of routing for logistics purposes, in a contested
environment where an adversary attempts to disrupt the vehicle along the chosen
route. We construct a game-theoretic model that captures the problem of optimal
routing in such an environment. While basic robust deterministic routing plans
are already challenging to devise, they tend to be predictable, which can limit
their effectiveness. By introducing calculated randomness via modeling the
route planning process as a two-player zero-sum game, we compute immediately
deployable plans that are diversified and harder to anticipate. Although
solving the game exactly is intractable in theory, our use of the double-oracle
framework enables us to achieve computation times on the order of seconds,
making the approach operationally viable. In particular, the framework is
modular enough to accommodate specialized routing algorithms as oracles. We
evaluate our method on real-world scenarios, showing that it scales effectively
to realistic problem sizes and significantly benefits from explicitly modeling
the adversary's capabilities, as demonstrated through ablation studies and
comparisons with baseline approaches.

Abstract: Equilibria of realistic multiplayer games constitute a key solution concept
both in practical applications, such as online advertising auctions and
electricity markets, and in analytical frameworks used to study strategic
voting in elections or assess policy impacts in integrated assessment models.
However, efficiently computing these equilibria requires games to have a
carefully designed structure and satisfy numerous restrictions; otherwise, the
computational complexity becomes prohibitive. In particular, finding even
approximate Nash equilibria in general-sum normal-form games with two or more
players is known to be PPAD-complete. Current state-of-the-art algorithms for
computing Nash equilibria in multiplayer normal-form games either suffer from
poor scalability due to their reliance on non-convex optimization solvers, or
lack guarantees of convergence to a true equilibrium. In this paper, we propose
a formulation of the Nash equilibrium computation problem as a polynomial
complementarity problem and develop a complete and sound spatial
branch-and-bound algorithm based on this formulation. We provide a qualitative
analysis arguing why one should expect our approach to perform well, and show
the relationship between approximate solutions to our formulation and that of
computing an approximate Nash equilibrium. Empirical evaluations demonstrate
that our algorithm substantially outperforms existing complete methods.
