### [1] [Efficient Video-to-Audio Generation via Multiple Foundation Models Mapper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04957)
*Gehui Chen,Guan'an Wang,Xiaowen Huang,Jitao Sang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MFM-Mapper通过融合双视觉编码器特征和使用GPT-2替换线性映射器，显著提升了视频到音频生成的训练效率和性能，仅需16%的训练量即可达到竞争性结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频到音频生成方法需要大量资源从头训练，而基于基础模型的映射方法虽然减少了训练成本，但在语义和时间特征提取方面仍有改进空间。

Method: 提出多基础模型映射器(MFM-Mapper)，融合双视觉编码器的特征来获取更丰富的语义和时间信息，并用GPT-2替代线性映射器来改善特征对齐，将跨模态特征映射视为自回归翻译任务。

Result: MFM-Mapper展现出卓越的训练效率，仅需先前映射方法16%的训练规模，就在语义和时间一致性方面获得更好性能，与大规模训练模型相比具有竞争力。

Conclusion: 该方法通过有效利用多个基础模型和先进的映射架构，显著降低了视频到音频生成的训练成本，同时保持了高质量的生成效果。

Abstract: Recent Video-to-Audio (V2A) generation relies on extracting semantic and
temporal features from video to condition generative models. Training these
models from scratch is resource intensive. Consequently, leveraging foundation
models (FMs) has gained traction due to their cross-modal knowledge transfer
and generalization capabilities. One prior work has explored fine-tuning a
lightweight mapper network to connect a pre-trained visual encoder with a
text-to-audio generation model for V2A. Inspired by this, we introduce the
Multiple Foundation Model Mapper (MFM-Mapper). Compared to the previous mapper
approach, MFM-Mapper benefits from richer semantic and temporal information by
fusing features from dual visual encoders. Furthermore, by replacing a linear
mapper with GPT-2, MFM-Mapper improves feature alignment, drawing parallels
between cross-modal features mapping and autoregressive translation tasks. Our
MFM-Mapper exhibits remarkable training efficiency. It achieves better
performance in semantic and temporal consistency with fewer training consuming,
requiring only 16\% of the training scale compared to previous mapper-based
work, yet achieves competitive performance with models trained on a much larger
scale.

### [2] [Facial Emotion Recognition does not detect feeling unsafe in automated driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04490)
*Abel van Elburg,Konstantinos Gkentsidis,Mathieu Sarrazin,Sarah Barendswaard,Varun Kotian,Riender Happee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 通过驾驶模拟器实验研究自动驾驶风根险感知，发现车辆运动咈皮电导可以预测主观风险感知，而面部表情识别效果不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究自动驾驶车的风险感知对公众接受度的重要影响，希望找到客观评估风险感知的方法。

Method: 使用32名参与者进行驾驶模拟器实验，测量主观舒适度、车辆运动、面部表情、皮电导、心率咈眼动跟踪等数据，并使用神经网络模型进行分析。

Result: 动态驾驶风格导致更强的不舒适感，行人跨路事件加剧了风险感知。面部表情识别效果不好，仅少数人显示惊讶表情。车辆运动咈皮电导模型能够有效预测主观风险感知。

Conclusion: 车辆运动咈皮电导可以作为客观评估自动驾驶风险感知的有效方法，而面部表情识别在这个场景下效果有限。

Abstract: Trust and perceived safety play a crucial role in the public acceptance of
automated vehicles. To understand perceived risk, an experiment was conducted
using a driving simulator under two automated driving styles and optionally
introducing a crossing pedestrian. Data was collected from 32 participants,
consisting of continuous subjective comfort ratings, motion, webcam footage for
facial expression, skin conductance, heart rate, and eye tracking. The
continuous subjective perceived risk ratings showed significant discomfort
associated with perceived risk during cornering and braking followed by relief
or even positive comfort on continuing the ride. The dynamic driving style
induced a stronger discomfort as compared to the calm driving style. The
crossing pedestrian did not affect discomfort with the calm driving style but
doubled the comfort decrement with the dynamic driving style. This illustrates
the importance of consequences of critical interactions in risk perception.
Facial expression was successfully analyzed for 24 participants but most
(15/24) did not show any detectable facial reaction to the critical event.
Among the 9 participants who did, 8 showed a Happy expression, and only 4
showed a Surprise expression. Fear was never dominant. This indicates that
facial expression recognition is not a reliable method for assessing perceived
risk in automated vehicles. To predict perceived risk a neural network model
was implemented using vehicle motion and skin conductance. The model correlated
well with reported perceived risk, demonstrating its potential for objective
perceived risk assessment in automated vehicles, reducing subjective bias and
highlighting areas for future research.

### [3] [PromptEnhancer: A Simple Approach to Enhance Text-to-Image Models via Chain-of-Thought Prompt Rewriting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04545)
*Linqing Wang,Ximing Xing,Yiji Cheng,Zhiyuan Zhao,Jiale Tao,Qixun Wang,Ruihuang Li,Xin Li,Mingrui Wu,Xinchi Deng,Chunyu Wang,Qinglin Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PromptEnhancer是一个通用的提示词重写框架，通过强化学习训练Chain-of-Thought重写器，显著提升文本到图像生成模型对复杂提示的理解和生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本到图像扩散模型在处理复杂用户提示时存在属性绑定、否定和组合关系等方面的困难，导致用户意图与生成结果之间存在显著不匹配。

Method: 提出PromptEnhancer框架，通过强化学习训练Chain-of-Thought重写器，使用专门的AlignEvaluator奖励模型提供细粒度反馈，基于24个关键点的系统分类法优化提示重写。

Result: 在HunyuanImage 2.1模型上的广泛实验表明，PromptEnhancer在各种语义和组合挑战中显著提高了图像-文本对齐度。

Conclusion: 该框架无需修改预训练模型权重即可提升任何T2I模型性能，并引入了新的人类偏好基准来促进未来研究。

Abstract: Recent advancements in text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have demonstrated
remarkable capabilities in generating high-fidelity images. However, these
models often struggle to faithfully render complex user prompts, particularly
in aspects like attribute binding, negation, and compositional relationships.
This leads to a significant mismatch between user intent and the generated
output. To address this challenge, we introduce PromptEnhancer, a novel and
universal prompt rewriting framework that enhances any pretrained T2I model
without requiring modifications to its weights. Unlike prior methods that rely
on model-specific fine-tuning or implicit reward signals like image-reward
scores, our framework decouples the rewriter from the generator. We achieve
this by training a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) rewriter through reinforcement
learning, guided by a dedicated reward model we term the AlignEvaluator. The
AlignEvaluator is trained to provide explicit and fine-grained feedback based
on a systematic taxonomy of 24 key points, which are derived from a
comprehensive analysis of common T2I failure modes. By optimizing the CoT
rewriter to maximize the reward from our AlignEvaluator, our framework learns
to generate prompts that are more precisely interpreted by T2I models.
Extensive experiments on the HunyuanImage 2.1 model demonstrate that
PromptEnhancer significantly improves image-text alignment across a wide range
of semantic and compositional challenges. Furthermore, we introduce a new,
high-quality human preference benchmark to facilitate future research in this
direction.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniPic2-SD3.5M-Kontext是一个2B参数的DiT模型，通过架构改进和大规模预训练，结合创新的渐进式双任务强化策略，在图像生成和编辑方面达到最先进性能，并成功扩展到统一多模态框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前开源多模态模型过于注重参数规模扩展而忽视训练策略优化，限制了效率和性能。需要开发更高效的训练方法来提升图像生成和编辑能力。

Method: 基于SD3.5-Medium进行架构修改，大规模高质量数据预训练，提出渐进式双任务强化策略(PDTR)，分阶段强化文本到图像生成和编辑任务，最后通过连接器与Qwen2.5-VL-7B集成构建统一多模态模型。

Result: 模型在图像生成和编辑方面超越了参数量更大的BAGEL(7B)和Flux-Kontext(12B)模型，验证了不同任务的强化阶段相互促进且无负面干扰。UniPic2-Metaquery在多样化任务中达到顶级性能。

Conclusion: 提出的训练范式Skywork UniPic 2.0具有有效性和通用性，通过优化的训练策略而非单纯参数扩展，实现了高性能的统一多模态理解、生成和编辑能力。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal models have demonstrated impressive
capabilities in unified image generation and editing. However, many prominent
open-source models prioritize scaling model parameters over optimizing training
strategies, limiting their efficiency and performance. In this work, we present
UniPic2-SD3.5M-Kontext, a 2B-parameter DiT model based on SD3.5-Medium, which
achieves state-of-the-art image generation and editing while extending
seamlessly into a unified multimodal framework. Our approach begins with
architectural modifications to SD3.5-Medium and large-scale pre-training on
high-quality data, enabling joint text-to-image generation and editing
capabilities. To enhance instruction following and editing consistency, we
propose a novel Progressive Dual-Task Reinforcement strategy (PDTR), which
effectively strengthens both tasks in a staged manner. We empirically validate
that the reinforcement phases for different tasks are mutually beneficial and
do not induce negative interference. After pre-training and reinforcement
strategies, UniPic2-SD3.5M-Kontext demonstrates stronger image generation and
editing capabilities than models with significantly larger generation
parameters-including BAGEL (7B) and Flux-Kontext (12B). Furthermore, following
the MetaQuery, we connect the UniPic2-SD3.5M-Kontext and Qwen2.5-VL-7B via a
connector and perform joint training to launch a unified multimodal model
UniPic2-Metaquery. UniPic2-Metaquery integrates understanding, generation, and
editing, achieving top-tier performance across diverse tasks with a simple and
scalable training paradigm. This consistently validates the effectiveness and
generalizability of our proposed training paradigm, which we formalize as
Skywork UniPic 2.0.

### [5] [Inpaint4Drag: Repurposing Inpainting Models for Drag-Based Image Editing via Bidirectional Warping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04582)
*Jingyi Lu,Kai Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Inpaint4Drag是一个基于像素空间的拖拽式图像编辑框架，通过双向变形和图像修复实现实时编辑，相比现有方法大幅提升交互体验和精度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有拖拽式图像编辑方法主要依赖生成模型的潜在空间操作，存在精度有限、反馈延迟和模型特定限制等问题，需要更直接高效的解决方案

Method: 将拖拽编辑分解为像素空间的双向变形和图像修复，将图像区域视为可变形材料，通过弹性物体变形原理保持自然形状，可作为通用适配器适用于任何修复模型

Result: 实现实时变形预览(0.01秒)和高效修复(0.3秒)，在512x512分辨率下显著优于需要数分钟编辑的现有方法，具有优异的视觉质量和精确控制

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一个通用、高效的拖拽式图像编辑框架，能够自动继承未来修复技术的改进，在保持实时性能的同时实现高质量的编辑效果

Abstract: Drag-based image editing has emerged as a powerful paradigm for intuitive
image manipulation. However, existing approaches predominantly rely on
manipulating the latent space of generative models, leading to limited
precision, delayed feedback, and model-specific constraints. Accordingly, we
present Inpaint4Drag, a novel framework that decomposes drag-based editing into
pixel-space bidirectional warping and image inpainting. Inspired by elastic
object deformation in the physical world, we treat image regions as deformable
materials that maintain natural shape under user manipulation. Our method
achieves real-time warping previews (0.01s) and efficient inpainting (0.3s) at
512x512 resolution, significantly improving the interaction experience compared
to existing methods that require minutes per edit. By transforming drag inputs
directly into standard inpainting formats, our approach serves as a universal
adapter for any inpainting model without architecture modification,
automatically inheriting all future improvements in inpainting technology.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior visual
quality and precise control while maintaining real-time performance. Project

### [6] [DisPatch: Disarming Adversarial Patches in Object Detection with Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04597)
*Jin Ma,Mohammed Aldeen,Christopher Salas,Feng Luo,Mashrur Chowdhury,Mert Pesé,Long Cheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DISPATCH是首个基于扩散模型的物体检测防御框架，采用"再生与修正"策略，通过扩散模型重新生成整个图像来消除对抗性补丁攻击，无需事先了解攻击类型，在多种攻击和检测器上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的物体检测器容易受到对抗性补丁攻击，这些攻击可以隐藏真实物体或创建虚假物体，造成严重后果。需要一种有效、通用且能抵抗自适应攻击的理想防御方法。

Method: 提出DISPATCH框架，利用扩散模型的生成能力重新生成整个图像，使其与良性数据对齐，然后通过修正过程识别并替换对抗性区域为重新生成的良性对应部分。该方法与攻击类型无关，无需事先了解现有补丁。

Result: 在多种检测器和攻击上的实验表明，DISPATCH在隐藏攻击上达到89.3%的最佳mAP.5分数，在非目标创建攻击上将攻击成功率降低到24.8%，且对自适应攻击保持强鲁棒性。

Conclusion: DISPATCH是一种实用可靠的物体检测系统防御方法，通过生成式模型消除攻击效果同时保持输入图像的完整性，在对抗性补丁防御方面表现优异。

Abstract: Object detection is fundamental to various real-world applications, such as
security monitoring and surveillance video analysis. Despite their
advancements, state-of-theart object detectors are still vulnerable to
adversarial patch attacks, which can be easily applied to real-world objects to
either conceal actual items or create non-existent ones, leading to severe
consequences. Given the current diversity of adversarial patch attacks and
potential unknown threats, an ideal defense method should be effective,
generalizable, and robust against adaptive attacks. In this work, we introduce
DISPATCH, the first diffusion-based defense framework for object detection.
Unlike previous works that aim to "detect and remove" adversarial patches,
DISPATCH adopts a "regenerate and rectify" strategy, leveraging generative
models to disarm attack effects while preserving the integrity of the input
image. Specifically, we utilize the in-distribution generative power of
diffusion models to regenerate the entire image, aligning it with benign data.
A rectification process is then employed to identify and replace adversarial
regions with their regenerated benign counterparts. DISPATCH is attack-agnostic
and requires no prior knowledge of the existing patches. Extensive experiments
across multiple detectors and attacks demonstrate that DISPATCH consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art defenses on both hiding attacks and creating
attacks, achieving the best overall mAP.5 score of 89.3% on hiding attacks, and
lowering the attack success rate to 24.8% on untargeted creating attacks.
Moreover, it maintains strong robustness against adaptive attacks, making it a
practical and reliable defense for object detection systems.

### [7] [WATCH: World-aware Allied Trajectory and pose reconstruction for Camera and Human](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04600)
*Qijun Ying,Zhongyuan Hu,Rui Zhang,Ronghui Li,Yu Lu,Zijiao Zeng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WATCH是一个从单目视频重建全局人体运动的统一框架，通过解析航向角分解和相机轨迹整合机制，解决了相机方向信息利用不足和相机平移线索整合无效的问题，在野外基准测试中达到了最先进的轨迹重建性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从野外单目视频重建全局人体运动在VR、图形和机器人应用中需求日益增长，但面临深度模糊、运动模糊以及相机与人体运动纠缠等挑战。现有方法在利用相机方向信息和整合相机平移线索方面存在不足。

Method: 提出WATCH框架：1）引入解析航向角分解技术，相比现有几何方法具有更好的效率和可扩展性；2）设计受世界模型启发的相机轨迹整合机制，提供利用相机平移信息的有效途径。

Result: 在野外基准测试中，WATCH在端到端轨迹重建方面达到了最先进的性能，证明了联合建模相机-人体运动关系的有效性。

Conclusion: 该工作为解决相机平移整合这一长期挑战提供了新的见解，代码将公开可用。

Abstract: Global human motion reconstruction from in-the-wild monocular videos is
increasingly demanded across VR, graphics, and robotics applications, yet
requires accurate mapping of human poses from camera to world coordinates-a
task challenged by depth ambiguity, motion ambiguity, and the entanglement
between camera and human movements. While human-motion-centric approaches excel
in preserving motion details and physical plausibility, they suffer from two
critical limitations: insufficient exploitation of camera orientation
information and ineffective integration of camera translation cues. We present
WATCH (World-aware Allied Trajectory and pose reconstruction for Camera and
Human), a unified framework addressing both challenges. Our approach introduces
an analytical heading angle decomposition technique that offers superior
efficiency and extensibility compared to existing geometric methods.
Additionally, we design a camera trajectory integration mechanism inspired by
world models, providing an effective pathway for leveraging camera translation
information beyond naive hard-decoding approaches. Through experiments on
in-the-wild benchmarks, WATCH achieves state-of-the-art performance in
end-to-end trajectory reconstruction. Our work demonstrates the effectiveness
of jointly modeling camera-human motion relationships and offers new insights
for addressing the long-standing challenge of camera translation integration in
global human motion reconstruction. The code will be available publicly.

### [8] [Sali4Vid: Saliency-Aware Video Reweighting and Adaptive Caption Retrieval for Dense Video Captioning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04602)
*MinJu Jeon,Si-Woo Kim,Ye-Chan Kim,HyunGee Kim,Dong-Jin Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Sali4Vid是一个简单有效的显著性感知框架，通过视频重加权和自适应字幕检索来解决密集视频字幕任务中的两个关键问题，在YouCook2和ViTT数据集上达到最先进效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有端到端模型存在两个局限性：(1)仅对文本应用时间戳监督，将所有视频帧同等对待；(2)从固定大小的视频块中检索字幕，忽略了场景转换。

Method: 提出Sali4Vid框架，包含两个核心组件：显著性感知视频重加权（将时间戳标注转换为基于sigmoid的帧重要性权重）和基于语义的自适应字幕检索（通过帧相似性分割视频以捕捉场景转换）。

Result: 在YouCook2和ViTT数据集上实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 联合改进视频加权和检索对于密集视频字幕任务具有显著益处，Sali4Vid框架简单而有效。

Abstract: Dense video captioning aims to temporally localize events in video and
generate captions for each event. While recent works propose end-to-end models,
they suffer from two limitations: (1) applying timestamp supervision only to
text while treating all video frames equally, and (2) retrieving captions from
fixed-size video chunks, overlooking scene transitions. To address these, we
propose Sali4Vid, a simple yet effective saliency-aware framework. We introduce
Saliency-aware Video Reweighting, which converts timestamp annotations into
sigmoid-based frame importance weights, and Semantic-based Adaptive Caption
Retrieval, which segments videos by frame similarity to capture scene
transitions and improve caption retrieval. Sali4Vid achieves state-of-the-art
results on YouCook2 and ViTT, demonstrating the benefit of jointly improving
video weighting and retrieval for dense video captioning

Abstract: Traffic congestion and violations pose significant challenges for urban
mobility and road safety. Traditional traffic monitoring systems, such as fixed
cameras and sensor-based methods, are often constrained by limited coverage,
low adaptability, and poor scalability. To address these challenges, this paper
introduces an advanced unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based traffic surveillance
system capable of accurate vehicle detection, classification, tracking, and
behavioral analysis in real-world, unconstrained urban environments. The system
leverages multi-scale and multi-angle template matching, Kalman filtering, and
homography-based calibration to process aerial video data collected from
altitudes of approximately 200 meters. A case study in urban area demonstrates
robust performance, achieving a detection precision of 91.8%, an F1-score of
90.5%, and tracking metrics (MOTA/MOTP) of 92.1% and 93.7%, respectively.
Beyond precise detection, the system classifies five vehicle types and
automatically detects critical traffic violations, including unsafe lane
changes, illegal double parking, and crosswalk obstructions, through the fusion
of geofencing, motion filtering, and trajectory deviation analysis. The
integrated analytics module supports origin-destination tracking, vehicle count
visualization, inter-class correlation analysis, and heatmap-based congestion
modeling. Additionally, the system enables entry-exit trajectory profiling,
vehicle density estimation across road segments, and movement direction
logging, supporting comprehensive multi-scale urban mobility analytics.
Experimental results confirms the system's scalability, accuracy, and practical
relevance, highlighting its potential as an enforcement-aware,
infrastructure-independent traffic monitoring solution for next-generation
smart cities.

### [10] [VCMamba: Bridging Convolutions with Multi-Directional Mamba for Efficient Visual Representation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04669)
*Mustafa Munir,Alex Zhang,Radu Marculescu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VCMamba是一个新颖的视觉骨干网络，结合了CNN的局部特征提取能力和多向Mamba SSM的全局建模能力，在ImageNet和ADE20K上取得了优异性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ViT和SSM在全局上下文建模方面表现出色，但缺乏CNN的细粒度局部特征提取能力；而CNN虽然擅长局部特征但缺乏全局推理能力，需要结合两者优势

Method: 采用卷积stem和分层结构，早期阶段使用卷积块提取局部特征，后期阶段使用多向Mamba块建模长距离依赖和全局上下文，保持线性复杂度

Result: VCMamba-B在ImageNet-1K达到82.6% top-1准确率，比PlainMamba-L3高0.3%且参数减少37%；在ADE20K上获得47.1 mIoU，比EfficientFormer-L7高2.0 mIoU且参数减少62%

Conclusion: VCMamba成功整合了CNN和Mamba SSM的优势，在保持线性复杂度的同时实现了优异的性能，为视觉任务提供了高效的混合架构解决方案

Abstract: Recent advances in Vision Transformers (ViTs) and State Space Models (SSMs)
have challenged the dominance of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in
computer vision. ViTs excel at capturing global context, and SSMs like Mamba
offer linear complexity for long sequences, yet they do not capture
fine-grained local features as effectively as CNNs. Conversely, CNNs possess
strong inductive biases for local features but lack the global reasoning
capabilities of transformers and Mamba. To bridge this gap, we introduce
\textit{VCMamba}, a novel vision backbone that integrates the strengths of CNNs
and multi-directional Mamba SSMs. VCMamba employs a convolutional stem and a
hierarchical structure with convolutional blocks in its early stages to extract
rich local features. These convolutional blocks are then processed by later
stages incorporating multi-directional Mamba blocks designed to efficiently
model long-range dependencies and global context. This hybrid design allows for
superior feature representation while maintaining linear complexity with
respect to image resolution. We demonstrate VCMamba's effectiveness through
extensive experiments on ImageNet-1K classification and ADE20K semantic
segmentation. Our VCMamba-B achieves 82.6% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K,
surpassing PlainMamba-L3 by 0.3% with 37% fewer parameters, and outperforming
Vision GNN-B by 0.3% with 64% fewer parameters. Furthermore, VCMamba-B obtains
47.1 mIoU on ADE20K, exceeding EfficientFormer-L7 by 2.0 mIoU while utilizing
62% fewer parameters. Code is available at
https://github.com/Wertyuui345/VCMamba.

*Vanshika Vats,Ashwani Rathee,James Davis*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出多智能体训练免费框架，通过Worker-Supervisor迭代架构协调通用视觉语言模型，确保语义分割结果严格遵循复杂的文本标注指南


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实应用中的语义分割不仅需要准确的分割掩码，还必须严格遵守复杂的文本标注指南。传统方法依赖昂贵的任务特定重训练，而现有的开放词汇分割方法在处理段落级复杂指南时表现不佳

Method: 多智能体训练免费框架，包含Worker执行分割、Supervisor根据检索到的指南进行批判、轻量级强化学习停止策略决定循环终止时机，形成迭代精炼架构

Result: 在Waymo和ReasonSeg数据集上评估，显著优于最先进的基线方法，展现出强大的泛化能力和指令遵循能力

Conclusion: 该框架能够有效解决复杂标注指南的遵循问题，在保证分割质量的同时平衡计算资源使用，为实际应用提供了可行的解决方案

Abstract: Semantic segmentation in real-world applications often requires not only
accurate masks but also strict adherence to textual labeling guidelines. These
guidelines are typically complex and long, and both human and automated
labeling often fail to follow them faithfully. Traditional approaches depend on
expensive task-specific retraining that must be repeated as the guidelines
evolve. Although recent open-vocabulary segmentation methods excel with simple
prompts, they often fail when confronted with sets of paragraph-length
guidelines that specify intricate segmentation rules. To address this, we
introduce a multi-agent, training-free framework that coordinates
general-purpose vision-language models within an iterative Worker-Supervisor
refinement architecture. The Worker performs the segmentation, the Supervisor
critiques it against the retrieved guidelines, and a lightweight reinforcement
learning stop policy decides when to terminate the loop, ensuring
guideline-consistent masks while balancing resource use. Evaluated on the Waymo
and ReasonSeg datasets, our method notably outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines, demonstrating strong generalization and instruction adherence.

### [12] [Domain Adaptation for Different Sensor Configurations in 3D Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04711)
*Satoshi Tanaka,Kok Seang Tan,Isamu Yamashita*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出两种技术来解决3D物体检测中不同传感器配置的域适应问题：下游微调和部分层微调，通过多数据集训练和选择性层更新来提升跨配置泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 不同车辆平台使用不同的传感器配置导致点云分布变化，使得在一个配置上训练的模型在其他配置上性能下降，而现有研究主要关注环境域差距和单一LiDAR内的密度变化，不同传感器配置间的域差距尚未充分探索。

Method: 提出两种技术：1) 下游微调 - 在多数据集训练后进行数据集特定微调；2) 部分层微调 - 只更新部分层以提高跨配置泛化能力。使用同一地理区域收集的多个传感器配置配对数据集进行实验。

Result: 联合训练结合下游微调和部分层微调始终优于每个配置的简单联合训练，证明了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该研究为将3D物体检测模型适配到多样化车辆平台提供了实用且可扩展的解决方案，解决了不同传感器配置间的域适应问题。

Abstract: Recent advances in autonomous driving have underscored the importance of
accurate 3D object detection, with LiDAR playing a central role due to its
robustness under diverse visibility conditions. However, different vehicle
platforms often deploy distinct sensor configurations, causing performance
degradation when models trained on one configuration are applied to another
because of shifts in the point cloud distribution. Prior work on multi-dataset
training and domain adaptation for 3D object detection has largely addressed
environmental domain gaps and density variation within a single LiDAR; in
contrast, the domain gap for different sensor configurations remains largely
unexplored. In this work, we address domain adaptation across different sensor
configurations in 3D object detection. We propose two techniques: Downstream
Fine-tuning (dataset-specific fine-tuning after multi-dataset training) and
Partial Layer Fine-tuning (updating only a subset of layers to improve
cross-configuration generalization). Using paired datasets collected in the
same geographic region with multiple sensor configurations, we show that joint
training with Downstream Fine-tuning and Partial Layer Fine-tuning consistently
outperforms naive joint training for each configuration. Our findings provide a
practical and scalable solution for adapting 3D object detection models to the
diverse vehicle platforms.

Method: 设计CD-Mamba混合模型，将卷积操作与Mamba状态空间模型相结合。卷积神经网络捐捕局部空间依赖关系，Mamba模型长程依赖关系，实现像素级细节和片段级依赖关系的全面捐捕。

Result: 大量实验验证了CD-Mamba的有效性，证明其在云检测任务上超越了现有方法的性能。

Conclusion: CD-Mamba通过整合卷积和Mamba模型的优势，能够同时处理不同空间尺度的依赖关系，显著提高了遥感图像云检测的准确性和可靠性。

Abstract: Remote sensing images are frequently obscured by cloud cover, posing
significant challenges to data integrity and reliability. Effective cloud
detection requires addressing both short-range spatial redundancies and
long-range atmospheric similarities among cloud patches. Convolutional neural
networks are effective at capturing local spatial dependencies, while Mamba has
strong capabilities in modeling long-range dependencies. To fully leverage both
local spatial relations and long-range dependencies, we propose CD-Mamba, a
hybrid model that integrates convolution and Mamba's state-space modeling into
a unified cloud detection network. CD-Mamba is designed to comprehensively
capture pixelwise textural details and long term patchwise dependencies for
cloud detection. This design enables CD-Mamba to manage both pixel-wise
interactions and extensive patch-wise dependencies simultaneously, improving
detection accuracy across diverse spatial scales. Extensive experiments
validate the effectiveness of CD-Mamba and demonstrate its superior performance
over existing methods.

TL;DR: 提出Task Consistency Training (TCT)框架解决医学图像分割中的类别不平衡问题，无需额外模型，通过一致性约束和过滤策略有效利用未标注数据


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像分割中获取所有类别的完整标注耗时费力，部分标注数据集存在严重类别不平衡，现有方法需要额外模型且容易产生标签噪声导致性能下降

Method: TCT框架包含主分割头和多辅助任务头，通过一致性约束利用未标注解剖结构，采用过滤策略排除低一致性噪声数据，引入统一辅助不确定性加权损失防止特定任务主导

Result: 在8个不同临床站点的腹部数据集上进行广泛实验，证明了方法的有效性

Conclusion: TCT框架能够有效解决部分标注数据集中的类别不平衡问题，无需额外模型，通过一致性训练和智能过滤策略提升分割性能

Abstract: Versatile medical image segmentation (VMIS) targets the segmentation of
multiple classes, while obtaining full annotations for all classes is often
impractical due to the time and labor required. Leveraging partially labeled
datasets (PLDs) presents a promising alternative; however, current VMIS
approaches face significant class imbalance due to the unequal category
distribution in PLDs. Existing methods attempt to address this by generating
pseudo-full labels. Nevertheless, these typically require additional models and
often result in potential performance degradation from label noise. In this
work, we introduce a Task Consistency Training (TCT) framework to address class
imbalance without requiring extra models. TCT includes a backbone network with
a main segmentation head (MSH) for multi-channel predictions and multiple
auxiliary task heads (ATHs) for task-specific predictions. By enforcing a
consistency constraint between the MSH and ATH predictions, TCT effectively
utilizes unlabeled anatomical structures. To avoid error propagation from
low-consistency, potentially noisy data, we propose a filtering strategy to
exclude such data. Additionally, we introduce a unified auxiliary
uncertainty-weighted loss (UAUWL) to mitigate segmentation quality declines
caused by the dominance of specific tasks. Extensive experiments on eight
abdominal datasets from diverse clinical sites demonstrate our approach's
effectiveness.

TL;DR: 该论文针对SAM和SAM2在恶劣天气条件下分割性能下降的问题，提出了两种不确定性感知方法来提升自动驾驶场景的分割鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉基础模型（如SAM和SAM2）在视觉模糊性高的恶劣天气条件下表现不佳，缺乏不确定性量化能力，而自动驾驶在安全关键场景中需要更可靠的分割结果。

Method: 1. 为SAM2设计多步微调程序，将不确定性指标直接融入损失函数；2. 将医学影像中的不确定性感知适配器（UAT）适配到驾驶场景中。

Result: 在CamVid、BDD100K和GTA驾驶数据集上的实验表明，UAT-SAM在极端天气下优于标准SAM，而带有不确定性感知损失的SAM2在各种驾驶场景中都获得了性能提升。

Conclusion: 显式的不确定性建模对于在挑战性环境中进行安全关键的自动驾驶具有重要价值，不确定性感知方法能显著提升分割模型在恶劣天气条件下的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Recent advances in vision foundation models, such as the Segment Anything
Model (SAM) and its successor SAM2, have achieved state-of-the-art performance
on general image segmentation benchmarks. However, these models struggle in
adverse weather conditions where visual ambiguity is high, largely due to their
lack of uncertainty quantification. Inspired by progress in medical imaging,
where uncertainty-aware training has improved reliability in ambiguous cases,
we investigate two approaches to enhance segmentation robustness for autonomous
driving. First, we introduce a multi-step finetuning procedure for SAM2 that
incorporates uncertainty metrics directly into the loss function, improving
overall scene recognition. Second, we adapt the Uncertainty-Aware Adapter
(UAT), originally designed for medical image segmentation, to driving contexts.
We evaluate both methods on CamVid, BDD100K, and GTA driving datasets.
Experiments show that UAT-SAM outperforms standard SAM in extreme weather,
while SAM2 with uncertainty-aware loss achieves improved performance across
diverse driving scenes. These findings underscore the value of explicit
uncertainty modeling for safety-critical autonomous driving in challenging
environments.

Abstract: Despite advances in practical and multimodal fine-grained Human Activity

HAR system that operates fully on smartwatches, addressing privacy and latency
issues associated with external data processing. By optimizing each component
of the pipeline, WatchHAR achieves compounding performance gains. We introduce
a novel architecture that unifies sensor data preprocessing and inference into
an end-to-end trainable module, achieving 5x faster processing while
maintaining over 90% accuracy across more than 25 activity classes. WatchHAR
outperforms state-of-the-art models for event detection and activity
classification while running directly on the smartwatch, achieving 9.3 ms
processing time for activity event detection and 11.8 ms for multimodal
activity classification. This research advances on-device activity recognition,
realizing smartwatches' potential as standalone, privacy-aware, and
minimally-invasive continuous activity tracking devices.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MCANet是一个多标签分类框架，通过多尺度特征学习和类别特定的残差注意力机制，显著提升了飓风后无人机图像损伤评估的准确性和可解释性，在RescueNet数据集上达到91.75%的mAP。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CNN方法难以捕捉多尺度空间特征，且无法有效区分视觉相似或共现的损伤类型，这限制了飓风后快速准确损伤评估的能力。

Method: 提出MCANet框架：1) 使用Res2Net层次化主干网络丰富多尺度空间上下文；2) 多头部类别特定残差注意力模块，每个注意力分支关注不同空间粒度；3) 平衡局部细节与全局上下文。

Result: 在RescueNet数据集(4,494张UAV图像)上，MCANet达到91.75% mAP，优于ResNet、Res2Net、VGG等基准模型。使用8个注意力头时性能提升至92.35%，对Road Blocked等困难类别的AP提升超过6%。类激活映射证实了模型定位损伤相关区域的能力。

Conclusion: MCANet为灾后风险评估、应急路线规划和数字孪生灾害响应提供了有效工具。未来可集成灾害特定知识图谱和多模态大语言模型，提升对未知灾害的适应性和语义理解能力。

Abstract: Rapid and accurate post-hurricane damage assessment is vital for disaster
response and recovery. Yet existing CNN-based methods struggle to capture
multi-scale spatial features and to distinguish visually similar or
co-occurring damage types. To address these issues, we propose MCANet, a
multi-label classification framework that learns multi-scale representations
and adaptively attends to spatially relevant regions for each damage category.
MCANet employs a Res2Net-based hierarchical backbone to enrich spatial context
across scales and a multi-head class-specific residual attention module to
enhance discrimination. Each attention branch focuses on different spatial
granularities, balancing local detail with global context. We evaluate MCANet
on the RescueNet dataset of 4,494 UAV images collected after Hurricane Michael.
MCANet achieves a mean average precision (mAP) of 91.75%, outperforming ResNet,
Res2Net, VGG, MobileNet, EfficientNet, and ViT. With eight attention heads,
performance further improves to 92.35%, boosting average precision for
challenging classes such as Road Blocked by over 6%. Class activation mapping
confirms MCANet's ability to localize damage-relevant regions, supporting
interpretability. Outputs from MCANet can inform post-disaster risk mapping,
emergency routing, and digital twin-based disaster response. Future work could
integrate disaster-specific knowledge graphs and multimodal large language
models to improve adaptability to unseen disasters and enrich semantic
understanding for real-world decision-making.

Motivation: 检测视频中的动态人群分组需要同时考虑局部外观特征和全局场景上下文，且分组结构应保持时间一致性

Method: 使用增强的视觉语言模型(VLM)提取每帧的局部和全局特征，通过基于分组概率图的全局优化方法检测动态变化的分组

Result: 在公开数据集上的实验结果表明，该方法优于最先进的分组检测方法

Conclusion: 提出的动态分组检测方法通过VLM特征提取和时序一致性优化，能够有效处理视频中动态变化的人群分组检测问题

Abstract: This paper proposes dynamic human group detection in videos. For detecting
complex groups, not only the local appearance features of in-group members but
also the global context of the scene are important. Such local and global
appearance features in each frame are extracted using a Vision-Language Model
(VLM) augmented for group detection in our method. For further improvement, the
group structure should be consistent over time. While previous methods are
stabilized on the assumption that groups are not changed in a video, our method
detects dynamically changing groups by global optimization using a graph with
all frames' groupness probabilities estimated by our groupness-augmented CLIP
features. Our experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms
state-of-the-art group detection methods on public datasets. Code:

Motivation: 现有计算机视觉洪水检测方法存在精度限制和泛化能力差的问题，依赖固定物体检测器和任务特定训练，需要开发能够跨不同洪水场景准确估计深度的通用方法。

Method: 结合GPT-4o的语义推理能力和结构化领域知识图谱，动态识别RGB图像中的参考物体，从知识图谱检索验证高度，估计淹没比例，应用统计异常值过滤计算最终深度值。

Result: 在MyCoast New York的110张众包图像上评估，平均绝对误差为8.17厘米，比GPT-4o基线降低20.5%，优于之前的CNN方法，具有良好的场景泛化能力和近实时操作性能。

Conclusion: FloodVision为零样本洪水深度估计提供了有效解决方案，适合集成到数字孪生平台和公民报告应用中，增强智慧城市的洪水韧性。

Abstract: Timely and accurate floodwater depth estimation is critical for road
accessibility and emergency response. While recent computer vision methods have
enabled flood detection, they suffer from both accuracy limitations and poor
generalization due to dependence on fixed object detectors and task-specific
training. To enable accurate depth estimation that can generalize across
diverse flood scenarios, this paper presents FloodVision, a zero-shot framework
that combines the semantic reasoning abilities of the foundation
vision-language model GPT-4o with a structured domain knowledge graph. The
knowledge graph encodes canonical real-world dimensions for common urban
objects including vehicles, people, and infrastructure elements to ground the
model's reasoning in physical reality. FloodVision dynamically identifies
visible reference objects in RGB images, retrieves verified heights from the
knowledge graph to mitigate hallucination, estimates submergence ratios, and
applies statistical outlier filtering to compute final depth values. Evaluated
on 110 crowdsourced images from MyCoast New York, FloodVision achieves a mean
absolute error of 8.17 cm, reducing the GPT-4o baseline 10.28 cm by 20.5% and
surpassing prior CNN-based methods. The system generalizes well across varying
scenes and operates in near real-time, making it suitable for future
integration into digital twin platforms and citizen-reporting apps for smart
city flood resilience.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有CLIP-based方法中双塔框架效果差、单塔框架效率低的问题，希望同时获得高效果和高效率。

Method: 提出PIG方法，包含伪查询生成器为每个视频生成伪查询，使视频特征和文本特征在收到真实查询前就能进行细粒度交互。

Result: 在5个常用文本-视频检索基准测试中，R@1指标提升1.6%~3.9%，效率与双塔模型相当，性能接近state-of-the-art。

Conclusion: 混合塔框架成功结合了双塔和单塔框架的优势，在保持高效率的同时显著提升了检索效果。

Abstract: The Text-to-Video Retrieval (T2VR) task aims to retrieve unlabeled videos by
textual queries with the same semantic meanings. Recent CLIP-based approaches
have explored two frameworks: Two-Tower versus Single-Tower framework, yet the
former suffers from low effectiveness, while the latter suffers from low
efficiency. In this study, we explore a new Hybrid-Tower framework that can
hybridize the advantages of the Two-Tower and Single-Tower framework, achieving
high effectiveness and efficiency simultaneously. We propose a novel hybrid
method, Fine-grained Pseudo-query Interaction and Generation for T2VR, ie, PIG,
which includes a new pseudo-query generator designed to generate a pseudo-query
for each video. This enables the video feature and the textual features of
pseudo-query to interact in a fine-grained manner, similar to the Single-Tower
approaches to hold high effectiveness, even before the real textual query is
received. Simultaneously, our method introduces no additional storage or
computational overhead compared to the Two-Tower framework during the inference
stage, thus maintaining high efficiency. Extensive experiments on five commonly
used text-video retrieval benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves a
significant improvement over the baseline, with an increase of $1.6\% \sim
3.9\%$ in R@1. Furthermore, our method matches the efficiency of Two-Tower
models while achieving near state-of-the-art performance, highlighting the
advantages of the Hybrid-Tower framework.

Conclusion: 该方法在医学图像超分辨率任务中表现出优越性能，为临床低分辨率MRI图像的质量提升提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: We propose a novel architecture called MLP-SRGAN, which is a single-dimension
Super Resolution Generative Adversarial Network (SRGAN) that utilizes
Multi-Layer Perceptron Mixers (MLP-Mixers) along with convolutional layers to
upsample in the slice direction. MLP-SRGAN is trained and validated using high
resolution (HR) FLAIR MRI from the MSSEG2 challenge dataset. The method was
applied to three multicentre FLAIR datasets (CAIN, ADNI, CCNA) of images with
low spatial resolution in the slice dimension to examine performance on
held-out (unseen) clinical data. Upsampled results are compared to several
state-of-the-art SR networks. For images with high resolution (HR) ground
truths, peak-signal-to-noise-ratio (PSNR) and structural similarity index
(SSIM) are used to measure upsampling performance. Several new structural,
no-reference image quality metrics were proposed to quantify sharpness (edge
strength), noise (entropy), and blurriness (low frequency information) in the
absence of ground truths. Results show MLP-SRGAN results in sharper edges, less
blurring, preserves more texture and fine-anatomical detail, with fewer
parameters, faster training/evaluation time, and smaller model size than
existing methods. Code for MLP-SRGAN training and inference, data generators,
models and no-reference image quality metrics will be available at

Conclusion: 预处理和学习基础方法对于在多样化条件下实现稳健的月球图像注册至关重要。

Abstract: Accurate image registration is critical for lunar exploration, enabling
surface mapping, resource localization, and mission planning. Aligning data
from diverse lunar sensors -- optical (e.g., Orbital High Resolution Camera,
Narrow and Wide Angle Cameras), hyperspectral (Imaging Infrared Spectrometer),
and radar (e.g., Dual-Frequency Synthetic Aperture Radar, Selene/Kaguya
mission) -- is challenging due to differences in resolution, illumination, and
sensor distortion. We evaluate five feature matching algorithms: SIFT, ASIFT,
AKAZE, RIFT2, and SuperGlue (a deep learning-based matcher), using
cross-modality image pairs from equatorial and polar regions. A preprocessing
pipeline is proposed, including georeferencing, resolution alignment, intensity
normalization, and enhancements like adaptive histogram equalization, principal
component analysis, and shadow correction. SuperGlue consistently yields the
lowest root mean square error and fastest runtimes. Classical methods such as
SIFT and AKAZE perform well near the equator but degrade under polar lighting.
The results highlight the importance of preprocessing and learning-based
approaches for robust lunar image registration across diverse conditions.

Abstract: Skin diseases are among the most prevalent health concerns worldwide, yet
conventional diagnostic methods are often costly, complex, and unavailable in
low-resource settings. Automated classification using deep learning has emerged
as a promising alternative, but existing studies are mostly limited to
dermoscopic datasets and a narrow range of disease classes. In this work, we
curate a large dataset of over 50 skin disease categories captured with mobile
devices, making it more representative of real-world conditions. We evaluate
multiple convolutional neural networks and Transformer-based architectures,
demonstrating that Transformer models, particularly the Swin Transformer,
achieve superior performance by effectively capturing global contextual
features. To enhance interpretability, we incorporate Gradient-weighted Class
Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM), which highlights clinically relevant regions and
provides transparency in model predictions. Our results underscore the
potential of Transformer-based approaches for mobile-acquired skin lesion
classification, paving the way toward accessible AI-assisted dermatological

Conclusion: 混合专家模型是获取良好校准预测不确定性的有效方法，在语义分割任务中表现出色，特别是在处理分布外数据时

Abstract: Estimating accurate and well-calibrated predictive uncertainty is important
for enhancing the reliability of computer vision models, especially in
safety-critical applications like traffic scene perception. While ensemble
methods are commonly used to quantify uncertainty by combining multiple models,
a mixture of experts (MoE) offers an efficient alternative by leveraging a
gating network to dynamically weight expert predictions based on the input.
Building on the promising use of MoEs for semantic segmentation in our previous
works, we show that well-calibrated predictive uncertainty estimates can be
extracted from MoEs without architectural modifications. We investigate three
methods to extract predictive uncertainty estimates: predictive entropy, mutual
information, and expert variance. We evaluate these methods for an MoE with two
experts trained on a semantical split of the A2D2 dataset. Our results show
that MoEs yield more reliable uncertainty estimates than ensembles in terms of
conditional correctness metrics under out-of-distribution (OOD) data.
Additionally, we evaluate routing uncertainty computed via gate entropy and
find that simple gating mechanisms lead to better calibration of routing
uncertainty estimates than more complex classwise gates. Finally, our
experiments on the Cityscapes dataset suggest that increasing the number of
experts can further enhance uncertainty calibration. Our code is available at

Motivation: 现有Mamba方法在光场超分辨率中存在多方向扫描策略效率低下、特征提取冗余的问题，且状态空间在保持空间-角度和视差信息方面存在局限

Method: 提出子空间简单扫描策略(Sub-SS)和子空间简单Mamba块(SSMB)；采用双阶段建模：第一阶段使用空间-角度残差子空间Mamba块(SA-RSMB)进行浅层特征提取，第二阶段使用双分支并行结构结合极平面Mamba块(EPMB)和极平面Transformer块(EPTB)进行深度特征精炼

Result: LFMT在真实和合成光场数据集上显著优于当前最先进方法，在保持低计算复杂度的同时实现了性能的实质性提升

Conclusion: LFMT框架成功整合了Mamba和Transformer的优势，能够全面探索空间、角度和极平面域的信息，为光场超分辨率提供了高效且高性能的解决方案

Abstract: Recently, Mamba-based methods, with its advantage in long-range information
modeling and linear complexity, have shown great potential in optimizing both
computational cost and performance of light field image super-resolution
(LFSR). However, current multi-directional scanning strategies lead to
inefficient and redundant feature extraction when applied to complex LF data.
To overcome this challenge, we propose a Subspace Simple Scanning (Sub-SS)
strategy, based on which we design the Subspace Simple Mamba Block (SSMB) to
achieve more efficient and precise feature extraction. Furthermore, we propose
a dual-stage modeling strategy to address the limitation of state space in
preserving spatial-angular and disparity information, thereby enabling a more
comprehensive exploration of non-local spatial-angular correlations.
Specifically, in stage I, we introduce the Spatial-Angular Residual Subspace
Mamba Block (SA-RSMB) for shallow spatial-angular feature extraction; in stage
II, we use a dual-branch parallel structure combining the Epipolar Plane Mamba
Block (EPMB) and Epipolar Plane Transformer Block (EPTB) for deep epipolar
feature refinement. Building upon meticulously designed modules and strategies,
we introduce a hybrid Mamba-Transformer framework, termed LFMT. LFMT integrates
the strengths of Mamba and Transformer models for LFSR, enabling comprehensive
information exploration across spatial, angular, and epipolar-plane domains.
Experimental results demonstrate that LFMT significantly outperforms current
state-of-the-art methods in LFSR, achieving substantial improvements in
performance while maintaining low computational complexity on both real-word
and synthetic LF datasets.

However, these methods rely exclusively on the referred target for supervision,
overlooking the potential benefits of prominent prospective targets. Moreover,
existing approaches often fail to incorporate multi-granularity discrimination,
which is crucial for robust object identification in complex scenarios. To
address these limitations, we propose PropVG, an end-to-end proposal-based
framework that, to the best of our knowledge, is the first to seamlessly
integrate foreground object proposal generation with referential object
comprehension without requiring additional detectors. Furthermore, we introduce
a Contrastive-based Refer Scoring (CRS) module, which employs contrastive
learning at both sentence and word levels to enhance the capability in
understanding and distinguishing referred objects. Additionally, we design a
Multi-granularity Target Discrimination (MTD) module that fuses object- and
semantic-level information to improve the recognition of absent targets.
Extensive experiments on gRefCOCO (GREC/GRES), Ref-ZOM, R-RefCOCO, and RefCOCO
(REC/RES) benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of PropVG. The codes and
models are available at https://github.com/Dmmm1997/PropVG.

TL;DR: TemporalFlowViz是一个针对超燃冲压发动机燃烧模拟的视觉分析系统，通过Vision Transformer提取特征、降维聚类和视觉语言模型生成自然语言描述，支持专家进行燃烧模式分析和知识发现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 超燃冲压发动机燃烧模拟产生的时空流场数据规模大、维度高，给视觉解释、特征区分和跨案例比较带来巨大挑战，需要专门的分析工具来支持专家理解复杂的燃烧动力学。

Method: 使用预训练的Vision Transformer从时间序列流场图像中提取高维嵌入，应用降维和基于密度的聚类发现潜在燃烧模式，构建时间轨迹跟踪模拟演化，并通过视觉语言模型生成自然语言描述。

Result: 通过两个专家案例研究和专家反馈证明，TemporalFlowViz能够增强假设生成、支持可解释模式发现，并促进大规模超燃冲压发动机燃烧分析中的知识发现。

Conclusion: TemporalFlowViz提供了一个有效的参数感知视觉分析工作流，成功解决了高维时空流场数据的分析挑战，为燃烧动力学研究提供了强大的可视化分析工具。

Abstract: Understanding the complex combustion dynamics within scramjet engines is
critical for advancing high-speed propulsion technologies. However, the large
scale and high dimensionality of simulation-generated temporal flow field data
present significant challenges for visual interpretation, feature
differentiation, and cross-case comparison. In this paper, we present
TemporalFlowViz, a parameter-aware visual analytics workflow and system
designed to support expert-driven clustering, visualization, and interpretation
of temporal flow fields from scramjet combustion simulations. Our approach
leverages hundreds of simulated combustion cases with varying initial
conditions, each producing time-sequenced flow field images. We use pretrained
Vision Transformers to extract high-dimensional embeddings from these frames,
apply dimensionality reduction and density-based clustering to uncover latent
combustion modes, and construct temporal trajectories in the embedding space to
track the evolution of each simulation over time. To bridge the gap between
latent representations and expert reasoning, domain specialists annotate
representative cluster centroids with descriptive labels. These annotations are
used as contextual prompts for a vision-language model, which generates
natural-language summaries for individual frames and full simulation cases. The
system also supports parameter-based filtering, similarity-based case
retrieval, and coordinated multi-view exploration to facilitate in-depth
analysis. We demonstrate the effectiveness of TemporalFlowViz through two
expert-informed case studies and expert feedback, showing TemporalFlowViz
enhances hypothesis generation, supports interpretable pattern discovery, and
enhances knowledge discovery in large-scale scramjet combustion analysis.

TL;DR: OmniFHT是一个无需姿态信息的3D折射率重建框架，通过傅里叶衍射定理和隐式神经表示，实现了对流动细胞的高通量断层成像，支持任意几何形状和多轴旋转。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有成像方法假设细胞进行均匀单轴旋转且需要已知每个帧的姿态，这限制了方法对近球形细胞的适用性，无法准确成像具有复杂旋转的不规则形状细胞，只能分析细胞群体的子集。

Method: 利用傅里叶衍射定理和隐式神经表示(INRs)，在弱散射假设下联合优化每个细胞的未知旋转轨迹和体积结构，支持稀疏采样投影和受限角度覆盖的连续表示。

Result: 能够从仅10个视图或120度角度范围内产生高保真结果，首次实现了整个流动细胞群体的原位高通量断层成像。

Conclusion: 为流式细胞术平台提供了一个可扩展且无偏的无标记形态计量分析解决方案。

Abstract: High-throughput 3D quantitative phase imaging (QPI) in flow cytometry enables
label-free, volumetric characterization of individual cells by reconstructing
their refractive index (RI) distributions from multiple viewing angles during
flow through microfluidic channels. However, current imaging methods assume
that cells undergo uniform, single-axis rotation, which require their poses to
be known at each frame. This assumption restricts applicability to
near-spherical cells and prevents accurate imaging of irregularly shaped cells
with complex rotations. As a result, only a subset of the cellular population
can be analyzed, limiting the ability of flow-based assays to perform robust
statistical analysis. We introduce OmniFHT, a pose-free 3D RI reconstruction
framework that leverages the Fourier diffraction theorem and implicit neural
representations (INRs) for high-throughput flow cytometry tomographic imaging.
By jointly optimizing each cell's unknown rotational trajectory and volumetric
structure under weak scattering assumptions, OmniFHT supports arbitrary cell
geometries and multi-axis rotations. Its continuous representation also allows
accurate reconstruction from sparsely sampled projections and restricted
angular coverage, producing high-fidelity results with as few as 10 views or
only 120 degrees of angular range. OmniFHT enables, for the first time, in
situ, high-throughput tomographic imaging of entire flowing cell populations,
providing a scalable and unbiased solution for label-free morphometric analysis
in flow cytometry platforms.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 基于半谷斯拟合的移动自主航空机器人重建方案CoRe-GS，通过语义分割和颜色筛选实现对象层面的高效精细重建，训练时间减少约25%，保持了高质量新视角渲染效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 移动自主航空机器人在远程指导和灾难响应等关键应用中需要既准确又高效的3D重建。传统方法重建整个场景效率低下，而关键对象通常在数据采集早期已可识别，因此需要一种能够重点重建关键对象的高效方案。

Method: 提出CoRe-GS方法：首先使用语义半谷斯拟合生成粗糕的可分割场景，然后通过新题的颜色基础有效筛选技术对语义对象进行精细化处理，实现高效的对象隔离和重建。

Result: 在SCRREAM（实际外部）和NeRDS 360（合成室内）两个数据集上评估，显示运行时间减少，新视角渲染质量提升，训练时间比完整语义GS训练周期约减少25%。

Conclusion: CoRe-GS方案通过聚焦关键对象的重建策略，在保持高质量3D重建的同时显著提升了效率，为移动自主航空机器人的实时应用提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Mobile reconstruction for autonomous aerial robotics holds strong potential
for critical applications such as tele-guidance and disaster response. These
tasks demand both accurate 3D reconstruction and fast scene processing. Instead
of reconstructing the entire scene in detail, it is often more efficient to
focus on specific objects, i.e., points of interest (PoIs). Mobile robots
equipped with advanced sensing can usually detect these early during data
acquisition or preliminary analysis, reducing the need for full-scene
optimization. Gaussian Splatting (GS) has recently shown promise in delivering
high-quality novel view synthesis and 3D representation by an incremental
learning process. Extending GS with scene editing, semantics adds useful
per-splat features to isolate objects effectively.
  Semantic 3D Gaussian editing can already be achieved before the full training
cycle is completed, reducing the overall training time. Moreover, the
semantically relevant area, the PoI, is usually already known during capturing.
To balance high-quality reconstruction with reduced training time, we propose
CoRe-GS. We first generate a coarse segmentation-ready scene with semantic GS
and then refine it for the semantic object using our novel color-based
effective filtering for effective object isolation. This is speeding up the
training process to be about a quarter less than a full training cycle for
semantic GS. We evaluate our approach on two datasets, SCRREAM (real-world,
outdoor) and NeRDS 360 (synthetic, indoor), showing reduced runtime and higher
novel-view-synthesis quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前前列腺癌冷冻消融治疗的手动规划过程依赖专家经验、耗时且结果不一致，需要自动化解决方案来提高治疗质量和可扩展性

Method: 将冷冻消融规划建模为马尔可夫决策过程，在模拟环境中通过强化学习代理顺序选择冷冻消融针位置和冰球直径，基于肿瘤覆盖率的奖励函数指导学习

Result: 在583个回顾性前列腺癌病例上评估，Cryo-RL相比最佳几何优化基线方法Dice系数提升超过8个百分点，达到人类专家水平，规划时间显著减少

Conclusion: 强化学习能够提供临床可行、可重复且高效的冷冻消融规划方案，具有重要的临床应用潜力

Abstract: Cryoablation is a minimally invasive localised treatment for prostate cancer
that destroys malignant tissue during de-freezing, while sparing surrounding
healthy structures. Its success depends on accurate preoperative planning of
cryoprobe placements to fully cover the tumour and avoid critical anatomy. This
planning is currently manual, expertise-dependent, and time-consuming, leading
to variability in treatment quality and limited scalability. In this work, we
introduce Cryo-RL, a reinforcement learning framework that models cryoablation
planning as a Markov decision process and learns an optimal policy for
cryoprobe placement. Within a simulated environment that models clinical
constraints and stochastic intraoperative variability, an agent sequentially
selects cryoprobe positions and ice sphere diameters. Guided by a reward
function based on tumour coverage, this agent learns a cryoablation strategy
that leads to optimal cryoprobe placements without the need for any
manually-designed plans. Evaluated on 583 retrospective prostate cancer cases,
Cryo-RL achieved over 8 percentage-point Dice improvements compared with the
best automated baselines, based on geometric optimisation, and matched human
expert performance while requiring substantially less planning time. These
results highlight the potential of reinforcement learning to deliver clinically
viable, reproducible, and efficient cryoablation plans.

TL;DR: 这篇论文研究了如何利用预训练计算机视觉模型预测对蜘蛛图片的恐惧程度，为调整式治疗提供技术支持。通过过渡学习三个模型，在313张图片数据集上平均MAE达到10.1-11.0，并进行了可解释性分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了开发能够根据患者反应动态调整视觉刺激的计算机化暴露治疗系统，需要先验证计算机视觉模型能否准确预测对蜘蛛图片的恐惧程度。

Method: 采用过渡学习方法调整三个预训练计算机视觉模型，在标准化的313张蜘蛛图片数据集上预测人类恐惧评分（0-100分度），使用交叉验证评估模型性能，并进行学习曲线和可解释性分析。

Result: 模型平均绝对误差（MAE）在10.1到11.0之间，学习曲线显示数据集缩减会明显降低性能，但过大数据集也无显著改善。可解释性分析证明模型基于蜘蛛特征做出预测，远视角度和人造蜘蛛图片导致更高错误。

Conclusion: 这些发现证明了可解释性计算机视觉模型在预测恐惧程度方面的潜力，强调了模型可解释性和足够数据集规模对开发有效情感感知治疗技术的重要性。

Abstract: Advances in computer vision have opened new avenues for clinical
applications, particularly in computerized exposure therapy where visual
stimuli can be dynamically adjusted based on patient responses. As a critical
step toward such adaptive systems, we investigated whether pretrained computer
vision models can accurately predict fear levels from spider-related images. We
adapted three diverse models using transfer learning to predict human fear
ratings (on a 0-100 scale) from a standardized dataset of 313 images. The
models were evaluated using cross-validation, achieving an average mean
absolute error (MAE) between 10.1 and 11.0. Our learning curve analysis
revealed that reducing the dataset size significantly harmed performance,
though further increases yielded no substantial gains. Explainability
assessments showed the models' predictions were based on spider-related
features. A category-wise error analysis further identified visual conditions
associated with higher errors (e.g., distant views and artificial/painted
spiders). These findings demonstrate the potential of explainable computer
vision models in predicting fear ratings, highlighting the importance of both
model explainability and a sufficient dataset size for developing effective
emotion-aware therapeutic technologies.

Method: 结合视觉语言模型和3D仿真渲染引擎，生成不同锈蚀条件的合成数据，用于训练计算机视觉模型。

Conclusion: 该方法可定制且易于扩展到其他工业磨损检测场景，为缺乏真实数据的CV任务提供了有效的合成数据解决方案。

Abstract: We propose an approach to generate synthetic data to train computer vision
(CV) models for industrial wear and tear detection. Wear and tear detection is
an important CV problem for predictive maintenance tasks in any industry.
However, data curation for training such models is expensive and time-consuming
due to the unavailability of datasets for different wear and tear scenarios.
Our approach employs a vision language model along with a 3D simulation and
rendering engine to generate synthetic data for varying rust conditions. We
evaluate our approach by training a CV model for rust detection using the
generated dataset and tested the trained model on real images of rusted
industrial objects. The model trained with the synthetic data generated by our
approach, outperforms the other approaches with a mAP50 score of 0.87. The
approach is customizable and can be easily extended to other industrial wear
and tear detection scenarios

Motivation: 皮脊细胞内脂豆计数是关键指标，但手动计数耗时主观，需要自动化解决方案

Method: 使用Nile Red染色图像，分为14个类别，通过数据增广扩展到50,000个细胞。比较基线MLP模型和注意力MIL模型（基于ResNet-50特征）

Result: 基线MLP表现更稳定（平均MAE=5.6），注意力MIL不稳定（平均MAE=10.7）但在某些折叠中更优

Conclusion: 简单的包级聚合提供了健壮基线，注意力MIL需要任务对齐池化和正则化才能充分发挥潜力

Abstract: Sebocytes are lipid-secreting cells whose differentiation is marked by the
accumulation of intracellular lipid droplets, making their quantification a key
readout in sebocyte biology. Manual counting is labor-intensive and subjective,
motivating automated solutions. Here, we introduce a simple attention-based
multiple instance learning (MIL) framework for sebocyte image analysis. Nile
Red-stained sebocyte images were annotated into 14 classes according to droplet
counts, expanded via data augmentation to about 50,000 cells. Two models were
benchmarked: a baseline multi-layer perceptron (MLP) trained on aggregated
patch-level counts, and an attention-based MIL model leveraging ResNet-50
features with instance weighting. Experiments using five-fold cross-validation
showed that the baseline MLP achieved more stable performance (mean MAE = 5.6)
compared with the attention-based MIL, which was less consistent (mean MAE =
10.7) but occasionally superior in specific folds. These findings indicate that
simple bag-level aggregation provides a robust baseline for slide-level droplet
counting, while attention-based MIL requires task-aligned pooling and
regularization to fully realize its potential in sebocyte image analysis.

Motivation: 单图像新视角合成任务由于未观察区域存在多重解释而高度不适定，现有方法往往基于模糊先验和输入视图附近的插值生成不可见区域，导致严重失真。

Method: 构建检索和增强系统，利用多模态大语言模型选择符合要求的参考图像；引入带多级隔离层的即插即用适配器模块动态生成目标视图的参考特征；设计解耦三重注意力机制有效对齐和整合多分支特征。

Result: 大量实验表明，UniView显著提升了新视角合成性能，在具有挑战性的数据集上优于最先进的方法。

Conclusion: 通过利用相似物体的参考图像提供强先验信息，UniView有效解决了单图像新视角合成中的失真问题，取得了优异的性能表现。

Abstract: The task of synthesizing novel views from a single image is highly ill-posed
due to multiple explanations for unobserved areas. Most current methods tend to
generate unseen regions from ambiguity priors and interpolation near input
views, which often lead to severe distortions. To address this limitation, we
propose a novel model dubbed as UniView, which can leverage reference images
from a similar object to provide strong prior information during view
synthesis. More specifically, we construct a retrieval and augmentation system
and employ a multimodal large language model (MLLM) to assist in selecting
reference images that meet our requirements. Additionally, a plug-and-play
adapter module with multi-level isolation layers is introduced to dynamically
generate reference features for the target views. Moreover, in order to
preserve the details of an original input image, we design a decoupled triple
attention mechanism, which can effectively align and integrate multi-branch
features into the synthesis process. Extensive experiments have demonstrated
that our UniView significantly improves novel view synthesis performance and
outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the challenging datasets.

Motivation: 现有红外-可见光图像融合方法假设高质量输入，无法处理双源退化场景，需要手动选择多个预增强步骤，导致误差累积和性能下降

Method: 设计引导频域模态特定提取(GFMSE)模块进行频域退化感知和抑制，以及引导空域模态聚合融合(GSMAF)模块进行跨模态退化过滤和自适应多源特征聚合

Result: 大量定性和定量实验表明，GD^2Fusion在双源退化场景下相比现有算法和策略实现了更优的融合性能

Conclusion: GD^2Fusion通过协同整合视觉语言模型和双域联合优化，有效解决了双源退化场景下的图像融合问题，代码将在论文接受后公开

Abstract: Most existing infrared-visible image fusion (IVIF) methods assume
high-quality inputs, and therefore struggle to handle dual-source degraded
scenarios, typically requiring manual selection and sequential application of
multiple pre-enhancement steps. This decoupled pre-enhancement-to-fusion
pipeline inevitably leads to error accumulation and performance degradation. To
overcome these limitations, we propose Guided Dual-Domain Fusion (GD^2Fusion),
a novel framework that synergistically integrates vision-language models (VLMs)
for degradation perception with dual-domain (frequency/spatial) joint
optimization. Concretely, the designed Guided Frequency Modality-Specific
Extraction (GFMSE) module performs frequency-domain degradation perception and
suppression and discriminatively extracts fusion-relevant sub-band features.
Meanwhile, the Guided Spatial Modality-Aggregated Fusion (GSMAF) module carries
out cross-modal degradation filtering and adaptive multi-source feature
aggregation in the spatial domain to enhance modality complementarity and
structural consistency. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments
demonstrate that GD^2Fusion achieves superior fusion performance compared with
existing algorithms and strategies in dual-source degraded scenarios. The code
will be publicly released after acceptance of this paper.

Abstract: Breast cancer remains a leading cause of cancer-related mortality among women
worldwide. Ultrasound imaging, widely used due to its safety and
cost-effectiveness, plays a key role in early detection, especially in patients
with dense breast tissue. This paper presents a comprehensive study on the
application of machine learning and deep learning techniques for breast cancer
classification using ultrasound images. Using datasets such as BUSI, BUS-BRA,
and BrEaST-Lesions USG, we evaluate classical machine learning models (SVM,
KNN) and deep convolutional neural networks (ResNet-18, EfficientNet-B0,
GoogLeNet). Experimental results show that ResNet-18 achieves the highest

models, though outperformed by CNNs, achieve competitive performance when
enhanced with deep feature extraction. Grad-CAM visualizations further improve
model transparency by highlighting diagnostically relevant image regions. These
findings support the integration of AI-based diagnostic tools into clinical
workflows and demonstrate the feasibility of deploying high-performing,

Conclusion: SLVM模型和Dark-traffic数据集有效解决了低光照交通场景感知问题，为相关研究提供了重要基准和解决方案。

Abstract: Fast and accurate object perception in low-light traffic scenes has attracted
increasing attention. However, due to severe illumination degradation and the
lack of reliable visual cues, existing perception models and methods struggle
to quickly adapt to and accurately predict in low-light environments. Moreover,
there is the absence of available large-scale benchmark specifically focused on
low-light traffic scenes. To bridge this gap, we introduce a physically
grounded illumination degradation method tailored to real-world low-light
settings and construct Dark-traffic, the largest densely annotated dataset to
date for low-light traffic scenes, supporting object detection, instance
segmentation, and optical flow estimation. We further propose the Separable
Learning Vision Model (SLVM), a biologically inspired framework designed to
enhance perception under adverse lighting. SLVM integrates four key components:
a light-adaptive pupillary mechanism for illumination-sensitive feature
extraction, a feature-level separable learning strategy for efficient
representation, task-specific decoupled branches for multi-task separable
learning, and a spatial misalignment-aware fusion module for precise
multi-feature alignment. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SLVM achieves
state-of-the-art performance with reduced computational overhead. Notably, it
outperforms RT-DETR by 11.2 percentage points in detection, YOLOv12 by 6.1
percentage points in instance segmentation, and reduces endpoint error (EPE) of
baseline by 12.37% on Dark-traffic. On the LIS benchmark, the end-to-end
trained SLVM surpasses Swin Transformer+EnlightenGAN and
ConvNeXt-T+EnlightenGAN by an average of 11 percentage points across key
metrics, and exceeds Mask RCNN (with light enhancement) by 3.1 percentage
points. The Dark-traffic dataset and complete code is released at

Abstract: The study explores the integration of transfer learning (TL) with

ShuffleNet. Experiments were conducted on three benchmark datasets: AHCD,
HIJJA, and IFHCDB. MobileNet emerged as the top-performing model, consistently
achieving superior accuracy, robustness, and efficiency, with ShuffleNet
excelling in generalization, particularly under full fine-tuning. The IFHCDB
dataset yielded the highest results, with 99% accuracy using MnasNet under full

AHCD dataset achieved competitive accuracy (97%) with ShuffleNet, while HIJJA
posed significant challenges due to its variability, achieving a peak accuracy
of 92% with ShuffleNet. Notably, full fine-tuning demonstrated the best overall
performance, balancing accuracy and convergence speed, while partial
fine-tuning underperformed across metrics. These findings underscore the

Result: 系统能够处理复杂几何形状、非流形网格，并有效泛化到各种人形角色（人类、机器人、卡通角色、生物和外星人），同时保持计算效率，实现高质量3D服装拟合。

Conclusion: LUIVITON提供了一个完全自动化的虚拟试穿解决方案，支持服装尺寸和材质的快速定制，无需2D缝制图案即可生成高质量的3D服装拟合效果。

Abstract: We present LUIVITON, an end-to-end system for fully automated virtual try-on,
capable of draping complex, multi-layer clothing onto diverse and arbitrarily
posed humanoid characters. To address the challenge of aligning complex
garments with arbitrary and highly diverse body shapes, we use SMPL as a proxy
representation and separate the clothing-to-body draping problem into two
correspondence tasks: 1) clothing-to-SMPL and 2) body-to-SMPL correspondence,
where each has its unique challenges. While we address the clothing-to-SMPL
fitting problem using a geometric learning-based approach for
partial-to-complete shape correspondence prediction, we introduce a diffusion
model-based approach for body-to-SMPL correspondence using multi-view
consistent appearance features and a pre-trained 2D foundation model. Our
method can handle complex geometries, non-manifold meshes, and generalizes
effectively to a wide range of humanoid characters -- including humans, robots,
cartoon subjects, creatures, and aliens, while maintaining computational
efficiency for practical adoption. In addition to offering a fully automatic
fitting solution, LUIVITON supports fast customization of clothing size,
allowing users to adjust clothing sizes and material properties after they have
been draped. We show that our system can produce high-quality 3D clothing
fittings without any human labor, even when 2D clothing sewing patterns are not
available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业产品检测通常仅使用正常样本训练异常检测模型，虽然可以收集缺陷样本但需要像素级标注，限制了可扩展性。需要一种能够利用少量用户交互和文本描述来生成精确标注的方法。

Method: 提出ADClick交互式图像分割算法，通过少量用户点击和简短文本描述生成像素级异常标注。进一步开发ADClick-Seg跨模态框架，使用基于原型的方法对齐视觉特征和文本提示，结合像素级先验和语言引导线索。

Result: ADClick在MVTec AD上达到AP=96.1%的优异性能。ADClick-Seg在具有挑战性的多类别异常检测任务上取得AP=80.0%、PRO=97.5%、Pixel-AUROC=99.1%的state-of-the-art结果。

Conclusion: ADClick和ADClick-Seg通过结合交互式分割和跨模态学习，有效解决了工业异常检测中标注成本高的问题，显著提升了模型性能，为实际工业应用提供了高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Industrial product inspection is often performed using Anomaly Detection (AD)
frameworks trained solely on non-defective samples. Although defective samples
can be collected during production, leveraging them usually requires
pixel-level annotations, limiting scalability. To address this, we propose
ADClick, an Interactive Image Segmentation (IIS) algorithm for industrial
anomaly detection. ADClick generates pixel-wise anomaly annotations from only a
few user clicks and a brief textual description, enabling precise and efficient
labeling that significantly improves AD model performance (e.g., AP = 96.1\% on
MVTec AD). We further introduce ADClick-Seg, a cross-modal framework that
aligns visual features and textual prompts via a prototype-based approach for
anomaly detection and localization. By combining pixel-level priors with
language-guided cues, ADClick-Seg achieves state-of-the-art results on the
challenging ``Multi-class'' AD task (AP = 80.0\%, PRO = 97.5\%, Pixel-AUROC =
99.1\% on MVTec AD).

Abstract: Background: To systematically review and perform a meta-analysis of
artificial intelligence (AI)-driven methods for detecting and correcting
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) motion artifacts, assessing current
developments, effectiveness, challenges, and future research directions.
Methods: A comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted,
focusing on deep learning (DL) approaches, particularly generative models, for
the detection and correction of MRI motion artifacts. Quantitative data were
extracted regarding utilized datasets, DL architectures, and performance
metrics. Results: DL, particularly generative models, show promise for reducing
motion artifacts and improving image quality; however, limited
generalizability, reliance on paired training data, and risk of visual
distortions remain key challenges that motivate standardized datasets and
reporting. Conclusions: AI-driven methods, particularly DL generative models,
show significant potential for improving MRI image quality by effectively
addressing motion artifacts. However, critical challenges must be addressed,
including the need for comprehensive public datasets, standardized reporting
protocols for artifact levels, and more advanced, adaptable DL techniques to
reduce reliance on extensive paired datasets. Addressing these aspects could
substantially enhance MRI diagnostic accuracy, reduce healthcare costs, and

Motivation: 现有方法主要使用低阶几何先验（如法向量），且通过噪声敏感方法估计不可靠，需要更鲁棒的几何约束来改进高斯溅射优化

Method: 提出基于主曲率初始化高斯尺度，引入高效且抗噪声的几何结构估计方法，为框架提供动态几何先验

Result: 在多个数据集的新视角合成实验中，GeoSplat显著提升了高斯溅射性能，超越了之前的基线方法

Conclusion: 该框架通过整合高阶几何先验和鲁棒估计方法，有效解决了现有几何约束方法的局限性，为高斯溅射优化提供了更可靠的几何指导

Abstract: A few recent works explored incorporating geometric priors to regularize the
optimization of Gaussian splatting, further improving its performance. However,
those early studies mainly focused on the use of low-order geometric priors
(e.g., normal vector), and they are also unreliably estimated by
noise-sensitive methods, like local principal component analysis. To address
their limitations, we first present GeoSplat, a general geometry-constrained
optimization framework that exploits both first-order and second-order
geometric quantities to improve the entire training pipeline of Gaussian
splatting, including Gaussian initialization, gradient update, and
densification. As an example, we initialize the scales of 3D Gaussian
primitives in terms of principal curvatures, leading to a better coverage of
the object surface than random initialization. Secondly, based on certain
geometric structures (e.g., local manifold), we introduce efficient and
noise-robust estimation methods that provide dynamic geometric priors for our
framework. We conduct extensive experiments on multiple datasets for novel view
synthesis, showing that our framework: GeoSplat, significantly improves the
performance of Gaussian splatting and outperforms previous baselines.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新的混合深度学习模型SIT，结合CNN的特征提取能力和Transformer的关系建模能力，通过多尺度特征交互模型来提高面部美学预测的性能，在SCUT-FBP5500数据集上创造了新的SOTA结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CNN模型在处理图像时通常在固定尺度上处理信息，容易忽略不同细尺度特征之间的关联性，而面部美学评估正需要考虑局部和全局特征的复杂交互作用。

Method: 提出Scale-Interaction Transformer (SIT)混合模型，首先使用并行卷积的多尺度模块提取不同感受野范围的面部特征，然后将这些多尺度表征构造为序列，通过Transformer编码器的自注意力机制显式建模它们之间的交互和上下文关系。

Result: 在SCUT-FBP5500标准数据集上，SIT模型达到了现有最高水平，获得了0.9187的Pearson相关系数，显著超过了之前的方法。

Conclusion: 显式建模多尺度视觉线索之间的交互作用对于高性能面部美孩预测至关重要，SIT模型的成功显示了混合CNN-Transformer模型在需要全局上下文理解的复杂图像回归任务中的潜力。

Abstract: Automated Facial Beauty Prediction (FBP) is a challenging computer vision
task due to the complex interplay of local and global facial features that
influence human perception. While Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) excel at
feature extraction, they often process information at a fixed scale,
potentially overlooking the critical inter-dependencies between features at
different levels of granularity. To address this limitation, we introduce the
Scale-Interaction Transformer (SIT), a novel hybrid deep learning architecture
that synergizes the feature extraction power of CNNs with the relational
modeling capabilities of Transformers. The SIT first employs a multi-scale
module with parallel convolutions to capture facial characteristics at varying
receptive fields. These multi-scale representations are then framed as a
sequence and processed by a Transformer encoder, which explicitly models their
interactions and contextual relationships via a self-attention mechanism. We
conduct extensive experiments on the widely-used SCUT-FBP5500 benchmark
dataset, where the proposed SIT model establishes a new state-of-the-art. It
achieves a Pearson Correlation of 0.9187, outperforming previous methods. Our
findings demonstrate that explicitly modeling the interplay between multi-scale
visual cues is crucial for high-performance FBP. The success of the SIT
architecture highlights the potential of hybrid CNN-Transformer models for
complex image regression tasks that demand a holistic, context-aware
understanding.

TL;DR: 使用稀疏混合专家(MoE)层替换CNN中的残差块或卷积层，在不增加推理成本的情况下提升模型对抗攻击的鲁棒性，特别是在结合对抗训练时效果显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提升卷积神经网络对抗对抗攻击的鲁棒性，传统方法往往需要资源密集的对策，而MoE层可以在不增加推理成本的情况下增加模型容量。

Method: 在ResNet架构的深层阶段插入单个MoE层，结合对抗训练，使用CIFAR-100数据集进行实验，评估PGD和AutoPGD攻击下的鲁棒性。

Result: 插入MoE层后模型鲁棒性得到一致提升，发现switch loss会导致路由崩溃到少数过度使用的专家上，意外地使这些路径更加鲁棒，某些单个专家的鲁棒性甚至超过门控MoE模型。

Conclusion: 稀疏MoE层能有效提升CNN对抗攻击的鲁棒性，鲁棒子路径通过专家专业化出现，为对抗鲁棒性研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Robustifying convolutional neural networks (CNNs) against adversarial attacks
remains challenging and often requires resource-intensive countermeasures. We
explore the use of sparse mixture-of-experts (MoE) layers to improve robustness
by replacing selected residual blocks or convolutional layers, thereby
increasing model capacity without additional inference cost. On ResNet
architectures trained on CIFAR-100, we find that inserting a single MoE layer
in the deeper stages leads to consistent improvements in robustness under PGD
and AutoPGD attacks when combined with adversarial training. Furthermore, we
discover that when switch loss is used for balancing, it causes routing to
collapse onto a small set of overused experts, thereby concentrating
adversarial training on these paths and inadvertently making them more robust.
As a result, some individual experts outperform the gated MoE model in
robustness, suggesting that robust subpaths emerge through specialization. Our
code is available at https://github.com/KASTEL-MobilityLab/robust-sparse-moes.

<details>

Motivation: 解决现实应用中源数据不可用、目标标签稀缺的域适应问题，特别是在医学和生物学领域中的连续值预测任务

Method: 基于Contradistinguisher框架，开发了CRAFT方法，用于源自由半监督的预训练模型迁移，不需要中间表示对齐

Result: 在两个神经科学数据集（EEG注视预测和MRI脑年龄预测）上，CRAFT在标签稀缺时比微调模型RMSE提升9%，比四种最先进的源自由方法性能高3%以上

Conclusion: CRAFT是生物学和医学中普遍存在的回归任务的高效源自由半监督深度迁移方法

Abstract: Deep learning models deployed in real-world applications (e.g., medicine)
face challenges because source models do not generalize well to domain-shifted
target data. Many successful domain adaptation (DA) approaches require full
access to source data. Yet, such requirements are unrealistic in scenarios
where source data cannot be shared either because of privacy concerns or
because it is too large and incurs prohibitive storage or computational costs.
Moreover, resource constraints may limit the availability of labeled targets.
We illustrate this challenge in a neuroscience setting where source data are
unavailable, labeled target data are meager, and predictions involve
continuous-valued outputs. We build upon Contradistinguisher (CUDA), an
efficient framework that learns a shared model across the labeled source and
unlabeled target samples, without intermediate representation alignment. Yet,
CUDA was designed for unsupervised DA, with full access to source data, and for
classification tasks. We develop CRAFT -- a Contradistinguisher-based
Regularization Approach for Flexible Training -- for source-free (SF),
semi-supervised transfer of pretrained models in regression tasks. We showcase
the efficacy of CRAFT in two neuroscience settings: gaze prediction with
electroencephalography (EEG) data and ``brain age'' prediction with structural
MRI data. For both datasets, CRAFT yielded up to 9% improvement in
root-mean-squared error (RMSE) over fine-tuned models when labeled training
examples were scarce. Moreover, CRAFT leveraged unlabeled target data and
outperformed four competing state-of-the-art source-free domain adaptation
models by more than 3%. Lastly, we demonstrate the efficacy of CRAFT on two
other real-world regression benchmarks. We propose CRAFT as an efficient
approach for source-free, semi-supervised deep transfer for regression that is
ubiquitous in biology and medicine.

Abstract: High-quality textures are critical for realistic 3D content creation, yet
existing generative methods are slow, rely on UV maps, and often fail to remain
faithful to a reference image. To address these challenges, we propose a
transformer-based framework that predicts a 3D texture field directly from a
single image and a mesh, eliminating the need for UV mapping and differentiable
rendering, and enabling faster texture generation. Our method integrates a
triplane representation with depth-based backprojection losses, enabling
efficient training and faster inference. Once trained, it generates
high-fidelity textures in a single forward pass, requiring only 0.2s per shape.
Extensive qualitative, quantitative, and user preference evaluations
demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on
single-image texture reconstruction in terms of both fidelity to the input
image and perceptual quality, highlighting its practicality for scalable,
high-quality, and controllable 3D content creation.

TL;DR: SGS-3D是一种基于"分割-生长"框架的训练免费精炼方法，通过融合语义和几何信息来提升3D实例分割精度，解决了2D到3D提升方法中的模糊语义引导和深度约束不足问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于2D到3D提升的3D实例分割方法由于提升过程中积累的误差（模糊语义引导和深度约束不足）而难以产生精确的实例级分割结果。

Method: 提出"分割-生长"框架：首先使用几何基元净化和分割模糊的提升掩码，然后在场景中将其生长为完整实例。包括基于3D几何基元共现的掩码过滤策略来识别和移除模糊掩码，以及利用空间连续性和高级特征构建细粒度对象实例。

Result: 在ScanNet200、ScanNet++和KITTI-360数据集上的实验结果表明，SGS-3D显著提高了分割精度和鲁棒性，能够从预训练模型的不准确掩码中生成高保真对象实例，并在不同室内外环境中保持强泛化能力。

Conclusion: SGS-3D作为一种训练免费的精炼方法，通过联合融合语义和几何信息，有效解决了3D实例分割中的模糊语义引导问题，实现了高精度的分割结果和良好的跨环境泛化性能。

Abstract: Accurate 3D instance segmentation is crucial for high-quality scene
understanding in the 3D vision domain. However, 3D instance segmentation based
on 2D-to-3D lifting approaches struggle to produce precise instance-level
segmentation, due to accumulated errors introduced during the lifting process
from ambiguous semantic guidance and insufficient depth constraints. To tackle
these challenges, we propose splitting and growing reliable semantic mask for
high-fidelity 3D instance segmentation (SGS-3D), a novel "split-then-grow"
framework that first purifies and splits ambiguous lifted masks using geometric
primitives, and then grows them into complete instances within the scene.
Unlike existing approaches that directly rely on raw lifted masks and sacrifice
segmentation accuracy, SGS-3D serves as a training-free refinement method that
jointly fuses semantic and geometric information, enabling effective
cooperation between the two levels of representation. Specifically, for
semantic guidance, we introduce a mask filtering strategy that leverages the
co-occurrence of 3D geometry primitives to identify and remove ambiguous masks,
thereby ensuring more reliable semantic consistency with the 3D object
instances. For the geometric refinement, we construct fine-grained object
instances by exploiting both spatial continuity and high-level features,
particularly in the case of semantic ambiguity between distinct objects.
Experimental results on ScanNet200, ScanNet++, and KITTI-360 demonstrate that
SGS-3D substantially improves segmentation accuracy and robustness against
inaccurate masks from pre-trained models, yielding high-fidelity object
instances while maintaining strong generalization across diverse indoor and
outdoor environments. Code is available in the supplementary materials.

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了手语识别中对比学习的局限性，通过学习更有意义的表示显著改善了手语识别性能，在多个下游任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Sign language recognition (SLR) is a machine learning task aiming to identify
signs in videos. Due to the scarcity of annotated data, unsupervised methods
like contrastive learning have become promising in this field. They learn
meaningful representations by pulling positive pairs (two augmented versions of
the same instance) closer and pushing negative pairs (different from the
positive pairs) apart. In SLR, in a sign video, only certain parts provide
information that is truly useful for its recognition. Applying contrastive
methods to SLR raises two issues: (i) contrastive learning methods treat all
parts of a video in the same way, without taking into account the relevance of
certain parts over others; (ii) shared movements between different signs make
negative pairs highly similar, complicating sign discrimination. These issues
lead to learning non-discriminative features for sign recognition and poor
results in downstream tasks. In response, this paper proposes a self-supervised
learning framework designed to learn meaningful representations for SLR. This
framework consists of two key components designed to work together: (i) a new
self-supervised approach with free-negative pairs; (ii) a new data augmentation
technique. This approach shows a considerable gain in accuracy compared to
several contrastive and self-supervised methods, across linear evaluation,
semi-supervised learning, and transferability between sign languages.

TL;DR: 这篇论文研究了大语言模型在符号图形编程任务中的表现，通过SVG程序生成来评估LLM的视觉理解能力，并提出了一种基于加强学习和可验证奖励的方法来提升SVG生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大语言模型在符号图形编程任务中的表现，通过生成SVG程序来测试LLM对视觉世界的理解能力，并尝试缩小专有模型与开源模型之间的性能差距。

Method: 首先构建了SGP-GenBench评测标准，测试对象保真性、场景保真性和组合性。提出了基于加强学习的方法，使用格式有效性检查确保SVG可渲染，并通过SigLIP和DINO等视觉编码器实现跨模态奖励对齐。

Result: 在Qwen-2.5-7B模型上应用该方法后，SVG生成质量和语义理解显著提升，达到了与领先系统相当的性能。RL训练还促使模型更好地将对象分解为可控制的原语，并添加了提升场景一致性的上下文细节。

Conclusion: 符号图形编程为跨模态基础提供了一个精确且可解释的视角，通过加强学习与可验证奖励的结合可以有效提升LLM在该任务上的表现。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at program synthesis, yet their ability to
produce symbolic graphics programs (SGPs) that render into precise visual
content remains underexplored. We study symbolic graphics programming, where
the goal is to generate an SGP from a natural-language description. This task
also serves as a lens into how LLMs understand the visual world by prompting
them to generate images rendered from SGPs. Among various SGPs, our paper
sticks to scalable vector graphics (SVGs). We begin by examining the extent to
which LLMs can generate SGPs. To this end, we introduce SGP-GenBench, a
comprehensive benchmark covering object fidelity, scene fidelity, and
compositionality (attribute binding, spatial relations, numeracy). On
SGP-GenBench, we discover that frontier proprietary models substantially
outperform open-source models, and performance correlates well with general
coding capabilities. Motivated by this gap, we aim to improve LLMs' ability to
generate SGPs. We propose a reinforcement learning (RL) with verifiable rewards
approach, where a format-validity gate ensures renderable SVG, and a
cross-modal reward aligns text and the rendered image via strong vision
encoders (e.g., SigLIP for text-image and DINO for image-image). Applied to
Qwen-2.5-7B, our method substantially improves SVG generation quality and
semantics, achieving performance on par with frontier systems. We further
analyze training dynamics, showing that RL induces (i) finer decomposition of
objects into controllable primitives and (ii) contextual details that improve
scene coherence. Our results demonstrate that symbolic graphics programming
offers a precise and interpretable lens on cross-modal grounding.

Abstract: The ability to compose learned concepts and apply them in novel settings is

rule-based tasks which apply a set of transformations to objects in grid-like

interoperable transformations, along with extensive control over grid
parametrization and object properties. This flexibility enables the creation of
millions of unique task rules -- surpassing concurrent datasets by several

virtually unlimited sample generation per rule. We provide baseline experiments

Result: 在多个数据集上的广泛实验验证表明，WinT3R在在线重建质量、相机位姿估计和重建速度方面达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: WinT3R通过创新的滑动窗口机制和紧凑相机表示设计，成功解决了重建质量与实时性能的权衡问题，实现了高效高质量的在线三维重建。

Abstract: We present WinT3R, a feed-forward reconstruction model capable of online
prediction of precise camera poses and high-quality point maps. Previous
methods suffer from a trade-off between reconstruction quality and real-time
performance. To address this, we first introduce a sliding window mechanism
that ensures sufficient information exchange among frames within the window,
thereby improving the quality of geometric predictions without large
computation. In addition, we leverage a compact representation of cameras and
maintain a global camera token pool, which enhances the reliability of camera
pose estimation without sacrificing efficiency. These designs enable WinT3R to
achieve state-of-the-art performance in terms of online reconstruction quality,
camera pose estimation, and reconstruction speed, as validated by extensive
experiments on diverse datasets. Code and model are publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLMs在图表理解中主要依赖识别而非推理，面对无标注图表时出现严重幻觉和性能下降，需要开发真正的视觉推理能力

Method: 提出ChartReasoner方法，通过模拟人类行为，在图表理解中基于视觉推理进行数值估计，建立了CRBench评估基准

Result: ChartReasoner-3B/7B在图表推理方面取得优越性能，超越GPT-4o和Gemini-2.5-Flash，在公开基准上也表现出显著的视觉推理能力提升

Conclusion: ChartReasoner方法能够引导MLLMs合理理解图表，显著提升图表理解性能，解决了现有模型依赖识别而非推理的问题

Abstract: Although Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated
increasingly impressive performance in chart understanding, most of them
exhibit alarming hallucinations and significant performance degradation when
handling non-annotated charts. Therefore, a question arises: Do MLLMs really
understand the charts? Since a human is capable of understanding charts and
estimating the values by visual reasoning, we first carefully establish a
comprehensive Chart Reasoning Benchmark CRBench to rigorously evaluate the
visual reasoning abilities of MLLMs on non-annotated charts. We argue that
MLLMs are primarily relying on recognition rather than reasoning to interpret
the charts. To steer MLLMs to reasonable chart understanding, we propose
ChartReasoner that mimics human behavior by grounding their estimation in chart
understanding. Extensive results on the proposed CRBench show that
ChartReasnoner-3B/7B achieves superior performance in chart reasoning, even
compared to GPT-4o and Gemini-2.5-Flash. More importantly, ChartReasnoner also
demonstrates the visual reasoning abilities in general chart comprehension on
public benchmarks, leading to significant performance gains and enabling MLLMs
to rationally understand the charts. The code and dataset will be publicly
available upon publication.

Method: 在两个主要本体（人类表型本体和基因本体）和两个高性能模型（GPT-4o和LLaMa 3.1 405B）上分析预测结果，评估9个与术语熟悉度、标识符使用、形态学和本体结构相关的候选特征，进行单变量和多变量分析。

Result: 分析表明，本体标识符的暴露程度是链接成功的最强预测因子。

Conclusion: 大语言模型在生物医学本体术语链接任务中的性能主要受标识符暴露程度的影响，这为改进模型在该领域的表现提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Large language models often perform well on biomedical NLP tasks but may fail
to link ontology terms to their correct identifiers. We investigate why these
failures occur by analyzing predictions across two major ontologies, Human
Phenotype Ontology and Gene Ontology, and two high-performing models, GPT-4o

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统知识图谱问答方法依赖语义解析，检索严格必要的信息，导致覆盖率低、受限于严格模式要求和语义模糊问题。

Method: 提出检索-过滤-摘要的三步流程：检索可能包含相关信息的广泛子图，过滤噪声，使用微调的LLM在知识子图上进行思维链推理和摘要。

Result: 实验显示KERAG在质量上超越最先进方法约7%，超过GPT-4o(Tool)10-21%。

Conclusion: KERAG通过更广泛的知识检索和有效的噪声过滤机制，显著提升了知识图谱问答的覆盖率和准确性。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mitigates hallucination in Large
Language Models (LLMs) by incorporating external data, with Knowledge Graphs
(KGs) offering crucial information for question answering. Traditional
Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA) methods rely on semantic parsing,
which typically retrieves knowledge strictly necessary for answer generation,
thus often suffer from low coverage due to rigid schema requirements and
semantic ambiguity. We present KERAG, a novel KG-based RAG pipeline that
enhances QA coverage by retrieving a broader subgraph likely to contain
relevant information. Our retrieval-filtering-summarization approach, combined
with fine-tuned LLMs for Chain-of-Thought reasoning on knowledge sub-graphs,
reduces noises and improves QA for both simple and complex questions.
Experiments demonstrate that KERAG surpasses state-of-the-art solutions by
about 7% in quality and exceeds GPT-4o (Tool) by 10-21%.

Motivation: 解决MLLM计算成本高与小模型性能低之间的矛盾，寻求性能和效率的平衡。

Method: 使用不确定性驱动的流水线机制：先由小模型快速处理所有输入，将高不确定性的困难样本转给MLLM深度分析，并通过加权平均和提示验证处理模糊/冲突预测。

Result: 在标准数据集上达到最先进性能，同时只需MLLM完全运行时的少量计算资源。

Conclusion: U-ACS系统通过样本难度识别和动态资源分配，在保持高精度的同时显著提升了计算效率。

Abstract: The advent of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has significantly
advanced the state-of-the-art in multimodal machine learning, yet their
substantial computational demands present a critical barrier to real-world
deployment. Conversely, smaller, specialized models offer high efficiency but
often at the cost of performance. To reconcile this performance-efficiency
trade-off, we propose a novel Uncertainty-Aware Collaborative System (U-ACS)
that synergistically orchestrates a powerful MLLM (e.g., HumanOmni) and a
lightweight baseline model for multimodal sentiment analysis. The core of our
system is an uncertainty-driven cascade mechanism, where the efficient small
model first acts as a rapid filter for all input samples. Only those samples
yielding high predictive uncertainty, thereby indicating greater difficulty,
are selectively escalated to the MLLM for more sophisticated analysis.
Furthermore, our system introduces advanced strategies to handle ambiguous or
conflicting predictions, including weighted averaging for predictions of
similar polarity and a prompt-based cross-verification to resolve conflicting
predictions when both models exhibit high uncertainty. This
sample-difficulty-aware approach allows for a dynamic allocation of
computational resources, drastically reducing inference costs while retaining
the high accuracy of MLLM. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets
demonstrate that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance,
while requiring only a fraction of the computational resources compared to
using a standalone MLLM.

Conclusion: 这项工作为评估LLM在同行评审中的使用提供了实践基础，有助于开发更精确、公平和可靠的检测方法。

Abstract: The growing integration of large language models (LLMs) into the peer review
process presents potential risks to the fairness and reliability of scholarly
evaluation. While LLMs offer valuable assistance for reviewers with language
refinement, there is growing concern over their use to generate substantive
review content. Existing general AI-generated text detectors are vulnerable to
paraphrasing attacks and struggle to distinguish between surface language
refinement and substantial content generation, suggesting that they primarily
rely on stylistic cues. When applied to peer review, this limitation can result
in unfairly suspecting reviews with permissible AI-assisted language
enhancement, while failing to catch deceptively humanized AI-generated reviews.
To address this, we propose a paradigm shift from style-based to content-based
detection. Specifically, we introduce CoCoNUTS, a content-oriented benchmark
built upon a fine-grained dataset of AI-generated peer reviews, covering six
distinct modes of human-AI collaboration. Furthermore, we develop CoCoDet, an
AI review detector via a multi-task learning framework, designed to achieve
more accurate and robust detection of AI involvement in review content. Our
work offers a practical foundation for evaluating the use of LLMs in peer
review, and contributes to the development of more precise, equitable, and
reliable detection methods for real-world scholarly applications. Our code and
data will be publicly available at https://github.com/Y1hanChen/COCONUTS.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 短文本情感分类面临类别不平衡、训练样本少、标签主观性强等挑战，上下文有限加剧了数据稀疏性和歧义性，阻碍有效学习

Method: 评估BERT和RoBERTa等小型Transformer模型，重点研究三个关键因素：领域特定继续预训练、生成式数据增强、分类头架构变体

Result: 数据增强能提高分类性能，但在增强数据集上继续预训练会引入噪声而非提升准确率，分类头修改带来的收益有限

Conclusion: 为资源受限环境下优化BERT模型提供了实用指导，改进了短文本数据集情感分类策略

Abstract: Sentiment classification in short text datasets faces significant challenges
such as class imbalance, limited training samples, and the inherent
subjectivity of sentiment labels -- issues that are further intensified by the
limited context in short texts. These factors make it difficult to resolve
ambiguity and exacerbate data sparsity, hindering effective learning. In this
paper, we evaluate the effectiveness of small Transformer-based models (i.e.,
BERT and RoBERTa, with fewer than 1 billion parameters) for multi-label
sentiment classification, with a particular focus on short-text settings.
Specifically, we evaluated three key factors influencing model performance: (1)
continued domain-specific pre-training, (2) data augmentation using
automatically generated examples, specifically generative data augmentation,
and (3) architectural variations of the classification head. Our experiment
results show that data augmentation improves classification performance, while
continued pre-training on augmented datasets can introduce noise rather than
boost accuracy. Furthermore, we confirm that modifications to the
classification head yield only marginal benefits. These findings provide
practical guidance for optimizing BERT-based models in resource-constrained
settings and refining strategies for sentiment classification in short-text
datasets.

TL;DR: PtoP是一个基于大语言模型的MBTI人格预测框架，通过检索增强生成和合成少数类过采样技术解决LLM幻觉问题和类别不平衡问题，在社交媒体数据集上实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从社交媒体帖子预测人格类型在心理学和社会学中有重要应用价值。虽然大语言模型在理解人格特质方面展现出巨大潜力，但直接应用面临两个关键挑战：LLM固有的幻觉问题和MBTI类型在人群中自然分布不平衡的问题。

Method: 提出PostToPersonality (PtoP)框架：1）利用检索增强生成和上下文学习来缓解LLM的幻觉问题；2）通过合成少数类过采样技术微调预训练LLM，生成合成样本来平衡类别不平衡问题。

Result: 在真实世界社交媒体数据集上的实验表明，PtoP相比10个机器学习和深度学习基线方法，达到了最先进的性能表现。

Conclusion: PtoP框架成功解决了LLM在MBTI预测中的幻觉和类别不平衡问题，为社交媒体人格预测提供了有效的解决方案，在多个基准方法中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Personality prediction from social media posts is a critical task that
implies diverse applications in psychology and sociology. The Myers Briggs Type
Indicator (MBTI), a popular personality inventory, has been traditionally
predicted by machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques. Recently,
the success of Large Language Models (LLMs) has revealed their huge potential
in understanding and inferring personality traits from social media content.
However, directly exploiting LLMs for MBTI prediction faces two key challenges:
the hallucination problem inherent in LLMs and the naturally imbalanced
distribution of MBTI types in the population. In this paper, we propose
PostToPersonality (PtoP), a novel LLM based framework for MBTI prediction from
social media posts of individuals. Specifically, PtoP leverages Retrieval
Augmented Generation with in context learning to mitigate hallucination in
LLMs. Furthermore, we fine tune a pretrained LLM to improve model specification
in MBTI understanding with synthetic minority oversampling, which balances the
class imbalance by generating synthetic samples. Experiments conducted on a
real world social media dataset demonstrate that PtoP achieves state of the art
performance compared with 10 ML and DL baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生物医学文献快速增长需要可扩展的NLP解决方案，评估GPT-5和GPT-4o在生物医学领域的性能表现

Method: 使用标准化BioNLP基准测试，在12个数据集上评估zero-shot、one-shot和five-shot提示，涵盖6类任务，使用固定提示模板和相同解码参数

Result: GPT-5在five-shot下macro-average得分0.557，优于GPT-4(0.506)和GPT-4o(0.508)；MedQA准确率达94.1%，超越监督SOTA 50+点；化学NER和关系抽取表现优异，但摘要和疾病NER仍落后

Conclusion: GPT-5已成为推理型生物医学问答的部署就绪通用模型，但精确抽取和证据密集型摘要仍需微调或混合方法，基准测试为BioNLP系统设计提供指导

Abstract: The rapid expansion of biomedical literature has heightened the need for
scalable natural language processing (NLP) solutions. While GPT-4 substantially
narrowed the gap with task-specific systems, especially in question answering,
its performance across other domains remained uneven. We updated a standardized
BioNLP benchmark to evaluate GPT-5 and GPT-4o under zero-, one-, and five-shot
prompting across 12 datasets spanning six task families: named entity
recognition, relation extraction, multi-label document classification, question
answering, text summarization, and text simplification. Using fixed prompt
templates, identical decoding parameters, and batch inference, we report
primary metrics per dataset and include prior results for GPT-4, GPT-3.5, and
LLaMA-2-13B for comparison. GPT-5 achieved the strongest overall benchmark
performance, with macro-average scores rising to 0.557 under five-shot
prompting versus 0.506 for GPT-4 and 0.508 for GPT-4o. On MedQA, GPT-5 reached
94.1% accuracy, exceeding the previous supervised state of the art by over
fifty points, and attained parity with supervised systems on PubMedQA (0.734).
In extraction tasks, GPT-5 delivered major gains in chemical NER (0.886 F1) and
ChemProt relation extraction (0.616 F1), outperforming GPT-4 and GPT-4o, though
summarization and disease NER still lagged behind domain-specific baselines.
These results establish GPT-5 as a general-purpose model now offering
deployment-ready performance for reasoning-oriented biomedical QA, while
precision-critical extraction and evidence-dense summarization continue to
favor fine-tuned or hybrid approaches. The benchmark delineates where simple
prompting suffices and where retrieval-augmented or planning-based scaffolds
are likely required, providing actionable guidance for BioNLP system design as
frontier models advance.

Motivation: 大型语言模型虽然取得重大突破，但仍会产生不可靠或误导性输出，当前研究主要关注量化模型不确定性，而很少诊断不确定性的具体来源。

Method: 收集目标LLM的多个响应，使用辅助LLM分析这些响应的分歧模式，推理不确定性的可能来源（输入歧义、知识缺乏等），并在知识缺乏情况下识别具体缺失的事实或概念。

Result: 在AmbigQA、OpenBookQA和MMLU-Pro数据集上验证了该框架的通用性，能够有效诊断不同的不确定性来源。

Conclusion: 这种不确定性诊断方法显示出通过相关人工干预来提升LLM性能和可靠性的潜力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have delivered significant breakthroughs across
diverse domains but can still produce unreliable or misleading outputs, posing
critical challenges for real-world applications. While many recent studies
focus on quantifying model uncertainty, relatively little work has been devoted
to \textit{diagnosing the source of uncertainty}. In this study, we show that,
when an LLM is uncertain, the patterns of disagreement among its multiple
generated responses contain rich clues about the underlying cause of
uncertainty. To illustrate this point, we collect multiple responses from a
target LLM and employ an auxiliary LLM to analyze their patterns of
disagreement. The auxiliary model is tasked to reason about the likely source
of uncertainty, such as whether it stems from ambiguity in the input question,
a lack of relevant knowledge, or both. In cases involving knowledge gaps, the
auxiliary model also identifies the specific missing facts or concepts
contributing to the uncertainty. In our experiment, we validate our framework
on AmbigQA, OpenBookQA, and MMLU-Pro, confirming its generality in diagnosing
distinct uncertainty sources. Such diagnosis shows the potential for relevant
manual interventions that improve LLM performance and reliability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索自动文本情感识别在争议解决中的价值，因为争议比谈判引发更强情感和不同社会过程，需要更好理解情感表达如何影响争议结果。

Method: 使用大型买家-卖家争议对话语料库，分析情感表达如何影响主观和客观结果，并比较大语言模型与传统情感标注方法的效果。

Result: 大语言模型在情感强度标注方面比先前方法具有显著更强的解释力，更接近人类标注者的决策，支持情感表达影响冲突升级和解决的理论模型。

Conclusion: 情感表达在争议解决中起关键作用，基于代理的系统可通过识别和缓解情感升级来有效管理争议，大语言模型为此提供了更好的技术基础。

Abstract: In conflict, people use emotional expressions to shape their counterparts'
thoughts, feelings, and actions. This paper explores whether automatic text
emotion recognition offers insight into this influence in the context of
dispute resolution. Prior work has shown the promise of such methods in
negotiations; however, disputes evoke stronger emotions and different social
processes. We use a large corpus of buyer-seller dispute dialogues to
investigate how emotional expressions shape subjective and objective outcomes.
We further demonstrate that large-language models yield considerably greater
explanatory power than previous methods for emotion intensity annotation and
better match the decisions of human annotators. Findings support existing
theoretical models for how emotional expressions contribute to conflict
escalation and resolution and suggest that agent-based systems could be useful
in managing disputes by recognizing and potentially mitigating emotional
escalation.

Abstract: Many of language models' impressive capabilities originate from their
in-context learning: based on instructions or examples, they can infer and
perform new tasks without weight updates. In this work, we investigate
\emph{when} representations for new tasks are formed in language models, and
\emph{how} these representations change over the course of context. We focus on
''transferrable'' task representations -- vector representations that can
restore task context in another instance of the model, even without the full
prompt. We show that these representations evolve in non-monotonic and sporadic
ways, and are distinct from a more inert representation of high-level task
categories that persists throughout the context. Specifically, models often
condense multiple evidence into these transferrable task representations, which
align well with the performance improvement based on more examples in the
context. However, this accrual process exhibits strong locality along the
sequence dimension, coming online only at certain tokens -- despite task
identity being reliably decodable throughout the context. Moreover, these local
but transferrable task representations tend to capture minimal ''task scopes'',
such as a semantically-independent subtask, and models rely on more
temporally-distributed representations to support longer and composite tasks.
This two-fold locality (temporal and semantic) underscores a kind of
just-in-time computational process underlying language models' ability to adapt
to new evidence and learn new tasks on the fly.

Motivation: 大语言模型部署面临高计算和内存成本挑战，现有剪枝方法往往忽略了实际应用中预填元-解码分离(PD)的特性。

Method: 构建剪枝和蓄粉集合，为预填元和解码阶段独立进行迭代块移除＋介绍令牌感知缓存剪枝机制，在解码阶段选择性重用首尾令牌序列的KV缓存条目

Result: 在PD分离和统一设置下均获得了一致的强劲性能，在默认设置下实现了320.56%的推理速度提升和4.95倍的数据传输带宽消耗降低

Conclusion: 该方法有效地解决了LLM部署中的计算和内存成本问题，为预填元-解码分离推理提供了一种高效的剪枝方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate exceptional capabilities across
various tasks, but their deployment is constrained by high computational and
memory costs. Model pruning provides an effective means to alleviate these
demands. However, existing methods often ignore the characteristics of
prefill-decode (PD) disaggregation in practice. In this paper, we propose a
novel pruning method for PD disaggregation inference, enabling more precise and
efficient block and KV Cache pruning. Our approach constructs pruning and
distillation sets to perform iterative block removal independently for the
prefill and decode stages, obtaining better pruning solutions. Moreover, we
introduce a token-aware cache pruning mechanism that retains all KV Cache in
the prefill stage but selectively reuses entries for the first and last token
sequences in selected layers during decode, reducing communication costs with
minimal overhead. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach
consistently achieves strong performance in both PD disaggregation and PD
unified settings without disaggregation. Under the default settings, our method
achieves a 20.56% inference speedup and a 4.95 times reduction in data
transmission bandwidth consumption.

Motivation: 大型语言模型在金融应用中有巨大潜力，但缺乏在专业金融场景下的系统性评估，特别是针对全球最严格的CFA专业认证的评估

Method: 使用1,560道CFA官方模拟考题，比较多模态、推理专用和轻量级三类LLM，采用零样本提示和新颖的RAG管道整合CFA课程内容

Result: 推理导向模型在零样本设置下表现最优，RAG管道显著提升复杂场景准确率，知识差距是主要失败原因，文本可读性影响很小

Conclusion: 为金融领域LLM部署提供实用指导，帮助从业者基于证据进行模型选择和成本效益优化

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models presents significant
opportunities for financial applications, yet systematic evaluation in
specialized financial contexts remains limited. This study presents the first
comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art LLMs using 1,560 multiple-choice
questions from official mock exams across Levels I-III of CFA, most rigorous
professional certifications globally that mirror real-world financial analysis
complexity. We compare models distinguished by core design priorities:
multi-modal and computationally powerful, reasoning-specialized and highly
accurate, and lightweight efficiency-optimized.
  We assess models under zero-shot prompting and through a novel
Retrieval-Augmented Generation pipeline that integrates official CFA curriculum
content. The RAG system achieves precise domain-specific knowledge retrieval
through hierarchical knowledge organization and structured query generation,
significantly enhancing reasoning accuracy in professional financial
certification evaluation.
  Results reveal that reasoning-oriented models consistently outperform others
in zero-shot settings, while the RAG pipeline provides substantial improvements
particularly for complex scenarios. Comprehensive error analysis identifies
knowledge gaps as the primary failure mode, with minimal impact from text
readability. These findings provide actionable insights for LLM deployment in
finance, offering practitioners evidence-based guidance for model selection and
cost-performance optimization.

Motivation: 大型语言模型在复杂指令遵循、减少幻觉和空间推理方面存在明显局限性，需要开发新的框架来提升这些能力。

Method: 集成中等规模LLM代理，采用新颖的抽象机制和话语模块来解析指令，在上下文中学习环境的动态高层次表示。

Result: 在自然协作构建任务中，COCORELI表现优于使用更大LLM的单LLM CoT和代理式LLM系统，能够大幅避免幻觉、识别缺失信息、请求澄清并更新学习到的对象。

Conclusion: COCORELI框架有效解决了LLM的关键局限性，其抽象能力不仅限于环境理解，还可扩展到其他领域如ToolBench API完成任务。

Abstract: We present COCORELI, a hybrid agent framework designed to tackle the

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MOSAIC是一个基于开源语言模型MedGemma-4B的多语言、分类法无关的放射学报告分类系统，支持零样本/少样本提示和轻量微调，在多种语言和影像模态上达到接近专家水平的性能，且计算效率高。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有放射学报告分类方法存在局限性：基于规则的方法难以处理语言变异性，监督模型需要大量标注数据，基于LLM的系统依赖闭源或资源密集型模型，且大多仅限于英语和单一模态/分类法。

Method: 基于紧凑的开源语言模型MedGemma-4B，支持零样本/少样本提示和轻量微调，可在消费级GPU上部署，支持多语言、多模态和多种分类法。

Result: 在7个数据集（英语、西班牙语、法语、丹麦语）上评估，平均宏观F1分数达88%，接近或超过专家水平，仅需24GB GPU内存。数据增强后，仅80个标注样本即可在丹麦语报告上达到82%的加权F1分数。

Conclusion: MOSAIC为临床环境提供了大型或专有LLM的实用替代方案，代码和模型开源，邀请社区评估和扩展到新语言、分类法和模态。

Abstract: Radiology reports contain rich clinical information that can be used to train
imaging models without relying on costly manual annotation. However, existing
approaches face critical limitations: rule-based methods struggle with
linguistic variability, supervised models require large annotated datasets, and
recent LLM-based systems depend on closed-source or resource-intensive models
that are unsuitable for clinical use. Moreover, current solutions are largely
restricted to English and single-modality, single-taxonomy datasets. We
introduce MOSAIC, a multilingual, taxonomy-agnostic, and computationally
efficient approach for radiological report classification. Built on a compact
open-access language model (MedGemma-4B), MOSAIC supports both zero-/few-shot
prompting and lightweight fine-tuning, enabling deployment on consumer-grade
GPUs. We evaluate MOSAIC across seven datasets in English, Spanish, French, and
Danish, spanning multiple imaging modalities and label taxonomies. The model
achieves a mean macro F1 score of 88 across five chest X-ray datasets,
approaching or exceeding expert-level performance, while requiring only 24 GB
of GPU memory. With data augmentation, as few as 80 annotated samples are
sufficient to reach a weighted F1 score of 82 on Danish reports, compared to 86
with the full 1600-sample training set. MOSAIC offers a practical alternative
to large or proprietary LLMs in clinical settings. Code and models are
open-source. We invite the community to evaluate and extend MOSAIC on new
languages, taxonomies, and modalities.

TL;DR: RECAP是一个新的基准测试，用于评估和改进意图重写技术，通过将模糊的用户-代理对话重构为简洁的用户目标表示，以提高对话助手的规划能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的对话往往存在模糊性、不完整性和动态变化，传统基于分类的方法在开放域设置中泛化能力差，导致意图检测和下游规划效果不佳。

Method: 提出RECAP基准数据集，包含歧义、意图漂移、模糊性和多目标对话等挑战；开发基于LLM的评估器来评估重写意图的规划效用；采用基于提示的重写方法，并微调两个基于DPO的重写器。

Result: 基于提示的重写方法优于基线，微调DPO重写器带来了额外的效用提升，证明了意图重写对于改进开放域对话系统代理规划的有效性。

Conclusion: 意图重写是改善开放域对话系统中代理规划的关键且可行的组件，RECAP基准为这一领域的研究提供了重要工具和评估标准。

Abstract: Understanding user intent is essential for effective planning in
conversational assistants, particularly those powered by large language models
(LLMs) coordinating multiple agents. However, real-world dialogues are often
ambiguous, underspecified, or dynamic, making intent detection a persistent
challenge. Traditional classification-based approaches struggle to generalize
in open-ended settings, leading to brittle interpretations and poor downstream
planning. We propose RECAP (REwriting Conversations for Agent Planning), a new
benchmark designed to evaluate and advance intent rewriting, reframing
user-agent dialogues into concise representations of user goals. RECAP captures
diverse challenges such as ambiguity, intent drift, vagueness, and mixed-goal
conversations. Alongside the dataset, we introduce an LLM-based evaluator that
assesses planning utility given the rewritten intent. Using RECAP, we develop a
prompt-based rewriting approach that outperforms baselines. We further
demonstrate that fine-tuning two DPO-based rewriters yields additional utility
gains. Our results highlight intent rewriting as a critical and tractable
component for improving agent planning in open-domain dialogue systems.

Abstract: While integrating speech encoder with LLM requires substantial data and
resources, use cases face limitations due to insufficient availability. To
address this, we propose a solution with a parameter-efficient adapter that
converts speech embeddings into LLM-compatible tokens, focusing on end-to-end
automatic speech recognition (ASR), named entity recognition (NER), and
sentiment analysis (SA). To reduce labeling costs, we employ an LLM-based
synthetic dataset annotation technique. The proposed adapter, using 7x fewer
trainable parameters, achieves significant performance gains: a 26% relative
Word Error Rates (WER) improvement on the LibriSpeech ASR task, a 6.3% relative
F1 score increase on the NER task, and a 32% relative F1 score boost on the SA
task. Moreover, using advanced techniques such as adding a classifier
regularizer and optimizing the LLM with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) yields
notable performance gains, with Spoken Language Understanding Evaluation (SLUE)
score improvement of 6.6% and 9.5%

TL;DR: 本文提出了首个专门评测推理解码方法在测试时扩展场景下性能的综合性基准，发现简单的n-元语法方法在处理重复逻辑时显示了独特优势，建议与模型基础或训练基础方法结合以平衡处理重复和多样化逻辑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 测试时扩展能提升大语言模型的逻辑能力，但产生的重复逻辑迹进行导致计算开销过大。推理解码方法有期待减少这种效率低下问题，但其在结构化重复丰富的测试时扩展环境中的效果尚未充分探索。

Method: 建立了一个综合性基准，包含一致的实验协议和代表性测试时扩展范式（如Best-of-N采样和多轮思考），对三类主要推理解码方法（模型基础、训练基础和n-元语法基础）进行公平比较。

Result: 大量实验显示，简单的n-元语法方法能够有效捕捉重复模式，在加速测试时扩展方面显示了独特潜力。这种现象说明将n-元语法方法与模型基础或训练基础方法结合，可以在测试时扩展中平衡对重复和多样化逻辑的加速效果。

Conclusion: 该基准有助于推动推理解码在测试时扩展领域的进一步研究，通过更好处理重复和多样化逻辑路径，实现更快速、更实用的大语言模型逻辑能力。

Abstract: Test-time scaling has emerged as a powerful paradigm for enhancing the
reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) by allocating additional
computational resources during inference. However, this paradigm is inherently
inefficient due to the generation of redundant and repetitive reasoning traces,
leading to significant computational overhead. Speculative decoding offers a
promising avenue for mitigating this inefficiency, yet its efficacy in the
structured, repetition-rich context of test-time scaling remains largely
unexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce the first comprehensive benchmark
designed to evaluate speculative decoding methods for accelerating LLM
test-time scaling. Our benchmark provides consistent experimental protocols
across representative test-time scaling paradigms (e.g., Best-of-N sampling and
multi-round thinking), enabling a fair comparison of three major categories of
speculative decoding: model-based, training-based, and n-gram-based methods.
Extensive experiments reveal that simple n-gram-based methods effectively
capture repetitive patterns, demonstrating unique potential in accelerating
test-time scaling. This phenomenon demonstrates the value of integrating
n-gram-based methods with model-based or training-based approaches to balance
acceleration for both repetitive and diverse reasoning in test-time scaling. We
hope this benchmark spurs further research on speculative decoding for
test-time scaling, enabling faster and more practical reasoning in LLMs through
better handling of repetitive and diverse reasoning paths.

TL;DR: ParaThinker通过并行思维框架解决LLM推理中的隧道视野问题，让模型同时生成多条推理路径并整合，相比顺序计算能更高效地提升推理性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LLM通过增加计算长度来提升推理能力，但存在边际效益递减的瓶颈，这是由于初始步骤不完美导致模型陷入次优推理路径的"隧道视野"问题

Method: 提出ParaThinker端到端框架，训练LLM并行生成多个多样化推理路径，然后整合成更优的最终答案，实现计算并行化而非顺序化

Result: 在挑战性推理基准测试中，ParaThinker相比顺序LLM取得显著准确率提升（1.5B模型平均提升12.3%，7B模型提升7.5%），仅增加7.1%的延迟开销

Conclusion: 并行计算（宽度扩展）比顺序计算（深度扩展）是更有效和高效的推理扩展方式，使小模型能超越更大模型，为未来LLM扩展确立了关键维度

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have been driven by test-time
compute scaling - a strategy that improves reasoning by generating longer,
sequential thought processes. While effective, this approach encounters a
significant bottleneck as computation increases, where further computation
offers only marginal performance gains. We argue this ceiling is not an
inherent limit of the model's capability but a flaw in the scaling strategy
itself, a phenomenon we term "Tunnel Vision", where a model's imperfect initial
steps lock it into a suboptimal reasoning path. To overcome this, we introduce
a new scaling paradigm: native thought parallelism. We present ParaThinker, an
end-to-end framework that trains an LLM to generate multiple, diverse reasoning
paths in parallel and synthesize them into a superior final answer. By
exploring different lines of thoughts simultaneously, ParaThinker effectively
sidesteps the Tunnel Vision issue and unlocks the model's latent reasoning
potential. Our approach demonstrates that scaling compute in parallel (width)
is a more effective and efficient way to superior reasoning than simply scaling
sequentially (depth). On challenging reasoning benchmarks, ParaThinker achieves
substantial accuracy improvements over sequential LLMs (12.3% for 1.5B and 7.5%
for 7B models on average with 8 parallel paths), while adding only negligible
latency overhead (7.1%). This enables smaller models to surpass much larger
counterparts and establishes parallel thinking as a critical, efficient
dimension for scaling future LLMs.

Abstract: Recently, text-to-molecule models have shown great potential across various
chemical applications, e.g., drug-discovery. These models adapt language models
to molecular data by representing molecules as sequences of atoms. However,
they rely on atom-level tokenizations, which primarily focus on modeling local
connectivity, thereby limiting the ability of models to capture the global
structural context within molecules. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel
text-to-molecule model, coined Context-Aware Molecular T5 (CAMT5). Inspired by
the significance of the substructure-level contexts in understanding molecule
structures, e.g., ring systems, we introduce substructure-level tokenization
for text-to-molecule models. Building on our tokenization scheme, we develop an
importance-based training strategy that prioritizes key substructures, enabling
CAMT5 to better capture the molecular semantics. Extensive experiments verify
the superiority of CAMT5 in various text-to-molecule generation tasks.
Intriguingly, we find that CAMT5 outperforms the state-of-the-art methods using
only 2% of training tokens. In addition, we propose a simple yet effective
ensemble strategy that aggregates the outputs of text-to-molecule models to
further boost the generation performance. Code is available at

Abstract: This paper presents an end-to-end mobile system that delivers
culturally-attuned safe driving feedback to drivers in Nigeria, a low-resource
environment with significant infrastructural challenges. The core of the system
is a novel dual-component Natural Language Generation (NLG) engine that
provides both legally-grounded safety tips and persuasive, theory-driven
behavioural reports. We describe the complete system architecture, including an
automatic trip detection service, on-device behaviour analysis, and a
sophisticated NLG pipeline that leverages a two-step reflection process to
ensure high-quality feedback. The system also integrates a specialized machine
learning model for detecting alcohol-influenced driving, a key local safety
issue. The architecture is engineered for robustness against intermittent
connectivity and noisy sensor data. A pilot deployment with 90 drivers
demonstrates the viability of our approach, and initial results on detected
unsafe behaviours are presented. This work provides a framework for applying

Motivation: 大型语言模型在稀有词汇预测方面存在困难，此前研究发现存在专门处理稀有词汇的"平台"神经元，但其功能组织机制尚不清楚。

Method: 通过在GPT-2 XL和Pythia模型中进行神经元影响分析、基于图的聚类和注意力头消融实验来研究稀有词汇处理机制。

Result: 发现：(1)稀有词汇处理需要额外的平台神经元，形成双计算机制；(2)平台神经元空间分布而非模块化聚集；(3)注意力机制没有优先路由到专门神经元。

Conclusion: 稀有词汇专业化通过分布式、训练驱动的分化而非架构模块化实现，既保持了上下文敏感灵活性，又实现了自适应能力分配。

Abstract: Large language models struggle with rare token prediction, yet the mechanisms
driving their specialization remain unclear. Prior work identified specialized
``plateau'' neurons for rare tokens following distinctive three-regime
influence patterns \cite{liu2025emergent}, but their functional organization is
unknown. We investigate this through neuron influence analyses, graph-based
clustering, and attention head ablations in GPT-2 XL and Pythia models. Our
findings show that: (1) rare token processing requires additional plateau
neurons beyond the power-law regime sufficient for common tokens, forming dual
computational regimes; (2) plateau neurons are spatially distributed rather
than forming modular clusters; and (3) attention mechanisms exhibit no
preferential routing to specialists. These results demonstrate that rare token
specialization arises through distributed, training-driven differentiation
rather than architectural modularity, preserving context-sensitive flexibility
while achieving adaptive capacity allocation.

Abstract: Visual Emotion Recognition (VER) is an important research topic due to its
wide range of applications, including opinion mining and advertisement design.
Extending this capability to recognize emotions at the individual level further
broadens its potential applications. Recently, Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) have attracted increasing attention and demonstrated performance
comparable to that of conventional VER methods. However, MLLMs are trained on
large and diverse datasets containing general opinions, which causes them to
favor majority viewpoints and familiar patterns. This tendency limits their
performance in a personalized VER, which is crucial for practical and
real-world applications, and indicates a key area for improvement. To address
this limitation, the proposed method employs discrete prompt tuning inspired by
the process of humans' prompt engineering to adapt the VER task to each
individual. Our method selects the best natural language representation from
the generated prompts and uses it to update the prompt for the realization of
accurate personalized VER.

k-nearest neighbour (kNN) density heuristic across both easy and hard
abstention splits, where hard cases are semantically challenging
near-distribution queries. The EBM achieves superior abstention performance
abstention on semantically hard cases, reaching AUROC 0.961 versus 0.950 for
softmax, while also reducing FPR@95 (0.235 vs 0.331). On easy negatives,
performance is comparable across methods, but the EBM's advantage becomes most
pronounced in safety-critical hard distributions. A comprehensive ablation with
controlled negative sampling and fair data exposure shows that robustness stems
primarily from the energy scoring head, while the inclusion or exclusion of
specific negative types (hard, easy, mixed) sharpens decision boundaries but is
not essential for generalisation to hard cases. These results demonstrate that
energy-based abstention scoring offers a more reliable confidence signal than
probability-based softmax confidence, providing a scalable and interpretable
foundation for safe RAG systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了DecMetrics框架，包含三个新指标来自动评估声明分解质量，并基于此开发了轻量级分解模型


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前研究主要关注生成式分解方法，但对分解后原子声明质量的评估不足，需要填补这一空白

Method: 引入COMPLETENESS、CORRECTNESS和SEMANTIC ENTROPY三个指标，将其作为奖励函数集成到轻量级声明分解模型的优化中

Result: 通过自动评估为声明分解建立了基准，提高了事实核查系统的可靠性和有效性

Conclusion: DecMetrics框架为声明分解质量评估提供了系统方法，通过指标驱动的模型优化提升了事实核查性能

Abstract: Claim decomposition plays a crucial role in the fact-checking process by
breaking down complex claims into simpler atomic components and identifying
their unfactual elements. Despite its importance, current research primarily
focuses on generative methods for decomposition, with insufficient emphasis on
evaluating the quality of these decomposed atomic claims. To bridge this gap,
we introduce \textbf{DecMetrics}, which comprises three new metrics:
\texttt{COMPLETENESS}, \texttt{CORRECTNESS}, and \texttt{SEMANTIC ENTROPY},
designed to automatically assess the quality of claims produced by
decomposition models. Utilizing these metrics, we develop a lightweight claim
decomposition model, optimizing its performance through the integration of
these metrics as a reward function. Through automatic evaluation, our approach
aims to set a benchmark for claim decomposition, enhancing both the reliability
and effectiveness of fact-checking systems.

TL;DR: 提出了RevUtil数据集和模型，用于评估同行评审评论的四个关键方面（可操作性、具体性、可验证性、帮助性），帮助提高评审质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着评审人员时间减少，需要自动化系统来确保评审质量，使反馈对作者更有用。

Method: 收集1,430条人工标注的评审评论，并使用10k条合成标注数据进行模型训练，包含评分理由。对评论的四个关键方面进行基准测试和理由生成。

Result: 微调模型在人类一致性方面达到甚至超过GPT-4o等强大闭源模型的水平。机器生成的评论在这四个方面普遍不如人类评审。

Conclusion: RevUtil数据集和相应模型能有效评估评审评论质量，为自动化同行评审支持系统提供基础。

Abstract: Providing constructive feedback to paper authors is a core component of peer
review. With reviewers increasingly having less time to perform reviews,
automated support systems are required to ensure high reviewing quality, thus
making the feedback in reviews useful for authors. To this end, we identify
four key aspects of review comments (individual points in weakness sections of
reviews) that drive the utility for authors: Actionability, Grounding &
Specificity, Verifiability, and Helpfulness. To enable evaluation and
development of models assessing review comments, we introduce the RevUtil
dataset. We collect 1,430 human-labeled review comments and scale our data with
10k synthetically labeled comments for training purposes. The synthetic data
additionally contains rationales, i.e., explanations for the aspect score of a
review comment. Employing the RevUtil dataset, we benchmark fine-tuned models
for assessing review comments on these aspects and generating rationales. Our
experiments demonstrate that these fine-tuned models achieve agreement levels
with humans comparable to, and in some cases exceeding, those of powerful
closed models like GPT-4o. Our analysis further reveals that machine-generated
reviews generally underperform human reviews on our four aspects.

TL;DR: ASCENDgpt是基于Transformer的心血管风险预测模型，通过创新的表型感知标记化方案，将47,155个原始ICD代码映射到176个临床有意义的表型标记，词汇量减少77.9%，在五种心血管结局预测中平均C-index达到0.816。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决电子健康记录(EHR)中大量ICD代码直接使用导致的计算效率低下和语义信息丢失问题，开发能够保持临床可解释性同时提高预测性能的心血管风险预测模型。

Method: 提出表型感知标记化方案，将原始ICD代码映射到临床表型标记；使用掩码语言建模目标在19,402个个体数据上进行预训练；针对心肌梗死、中风、MACE、心血管死亡和全因死亡率五种结局进行时间到事件预测的微调。

Conclusion: 基于表型的方法能够在保持计算效率的同时实现临床可解释的预测，证明了领域特定标记化和预训练在EHR风险预测任务中的有效性。

Abstract: We present ASCENDgpt, a transformer-based model specifically designed for
cardiovascular risk prediction from longitudinal electronic health records
(EHRs). Our approach introduces a novel phenotype-aware tokenization scheme
that maps 47,155 raw ICD codes to 176 clinically meaningful phenotype tokens,
achieving 99.6\% consolidation of diagnosis codes while preserving semantic
information. This phenotype mapping contributes to a total vocabulary of 10,442
tokens - a 77.9\% reduction when compared with using raw ICD codes directly. We
pretrain ASCENDgpt on sequences derived from 19402 unique individuals using a
masked language modeling objective, then fine-tune for time-to-event prediction
of five cardiovascular outcomes: myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, major
adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), cardiovascular death, and all-cause
mortality. Our model achieves excellent discrimination on the held-out test set
with an average C-index of 0.816, demonstrating strong performance across all
outcomes (MI: 0.792, stroke: 0.824, MACE: 0.800, cardiovascular death: 0.842,
all-cause mortality: 0.824). The phenotype-based approach enables clinically
interpretable predictions while maintaining computational efficiency. Our work
demonstrates the effectiveness of domain-specific tokenization and pretraining
for EHR-based risk prediction tasks.

*Hao Shi,Yusuke Fujita,Tomoya Mizumoto,Lianbo Liu,Atsushi Kojima,Yui Sudo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种使用序列化输出提示(SOP)来改善基于大语言模型的多讲者语音识别系统性能的方法，通过结构化提示和三阶段训练策略在复杂场景下显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多讲者语音识别系统要么省略提示要么仅使用简单任务定义提示，没有深入研究如何通过提示设计来提高系统性能。

Method: 提出SOP方法，在语音编码器后插入分离器和序列化CTC层，以先说先出方式分离和提取多讲者内容，通迈贪婪搜索解码获得SOP提示，采用三阶段训练策略包括SOT微调、序列化语音信息提取和SOP适配。

Result: 在LibriMix数据集上的实验结果显示，SOT模型在两讲者场景下表现良好，但在三讲者等更复杂条件下无法充分利用LLM。SOP方法在两者和三者条件下都显著提高了性能。

Conclusion: 通过SOP提示方法可以有效改善基于大语言模型的多讲者语音识别系统在复杂场景下的性能，为提示工程在语音识别领域的应用提供了新的视角。

Abstract: Prompts are crucial for task definition and for improving the performance of
large language models (LLM)-based systems. However, existing LLM-based
multi-talker (MT) automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems either omit
prompts or rely on simple task-definition prompts, with no prior work exploring
the design of prompts to enhance performance. In this paper, we propose
extracting serialized output prompts (SOP) and explicitly guiding the LLM using
structured prompts to improve system performance (SOP-MT-ASR). A Separator and
serialized Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) layers are inserted
after the speech encoder to separate and extract MT content from the mixed
speech encoding in a first-speaking-first-out manner. Subsequently, the SOP,
which serves as a prompt for LLMs, is obtained by decoding the serialized CTC
outputs using greedy search. To train the model effectively, we design a
three-stage training strategy, consisting of serialized output training (SOT)
fine-tuning, serialized speech information extraction, and SOP-based
adaptation. Experimental results on the LibriMix dataset show that, although
the LLM-based SOT model performs well in the two-talker scenario, it fails to
fully leverage LLMs under more complex conditions, such as the three-talker
scenario. The proposed SOP approach significantly improved performance under
both two- and three-talker conditions.

*Xinnian Zhao,Hugo Van Hamme*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 通过将TV字幕重构为上下文提示，而非直接监督信号，提出了一种弱监督ASR方法，通过迭代精炼伪标签和加权注意力机制，显著提高了语音识别的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: TV字幕虽然容易获得，但与音频的对齐不准确，无法直接作为词字词转写的监督目标。需要一种方法来处理语音和字幕文本之间的差异。

Method: 将TV字幕作为上下文丰富的提示，而非直接监督信号；通过迭代精炼生成伪譬转写文本作为主要目标；使用加权注意力机制在推理时强调相关字幕标记。

Result: 实验结果显示转写准确性有显著提高，证明了方法在精炼转写文本方面的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法能够生成高质量的伪标签数据集，为训练健壮的自动语音识别系统提供了基础资源。

Abstract: This study proposes a novel approach to using TV subtitles within a weakly
supervised (WS) Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) framework. Although TV
subtitles are readily available, their imprecise alignment with corresponding
audio limits their applicability as supervised targets for verbatim
transcription. Rather than using subtitles as direct supervision signals, our
method reimagines them as context-rich prompts. This design enables the model
to handle discrepancies between spoken audio and subtitle text. Instead,
generated pseudo transcripts become the primary targets, with subtitles acting
as guiding cues for iterative refinement. To further enhance the process, we
introduce a weighted attention mechanism that emphasizes relevant subtitle
tokens during inference. Our experiments demonstrate significant improvements
in transcription accuracy, highlighting the effectiveness of the proposed
method in refining transcripts. These enhanced pseudo-labeled datasets provide
high-quality foundational resources for training robust ASR systems.

*Charles Moslonka,Hicham Randrianarivo,Arthur Garnier,Emmanuel Malherbe*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种用于大语言模型问答任务中幻觉检测的应用方法，通过利用限数的前排对数概率来推断不确定性，无需多次查询重运行。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在问答任务中的幻觉现象严重影响其实际可靠性，特别是在数据访问受限的黑盒API场景下。

Method: 从非贪婪解码过程中获取的前排对数概率推导不确定性指标，首先提出熵配生成率(EPR)指标，然后通过监督学习进行增强。

Result: 在多个问答数据集和不同模型上评估，该方法显著提升了幻觉检测性能，仅使用少量对数概率(如前10个)即可实现高性能。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种即可部署的技术，能够在单次生成中提高LLM回答的可信过程，特别适用于问答和检索增强生成系统。

Abstract: Hallucinations in Large Language Model (LLM) outputs for Question Answering
(QA) tasks critically undermine their real-world reliability. This paper
introduces an applied methodology for robust, one-shot hallucination detection,
specifically designed for scenarios with limited data access, such as
interacting with black-box LLM APIs that typically expose only a few top
candidate log-probabilities per token. Our approach derives uncertainty
indicators directly from these readily available log-probabilities generated
during non-greedy decoding. We first derive an Entropy Production Rate (EPR)
metric that offers baseline performance, later augmented with supervised
learning. Our learned model uses features representing the entropic
contributions of the accessible top-ranked tokens within a single generated
sequence, requiring no multiple query re-runs. Evaluated across diverse QA
datasets and multiple LLMs, this estimator significantly improves hallucination
detection over using EPR alone. Crucially, high performance is demonstrated
using only the typically small set of available log-probabilities (e.g., top
<10 per token), confirming its practical efficiency and suitability for these
API-constrained deployments. This work provides a readily deployable technique
to enhance the trustworthiness of LLM responses from a single generation pass
in QA and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, with its utility
further demonstrated in a finance framework analyzing responses to queries on
annual reports from an industrial dataset.

TL;DR: 通过分析ICU出院摘要中的临床记录，结合BioBERT情感嵌入和词汇压力识别，建立了一种预测医护人员熬熬的高准确方法，超越传统的元数据基准方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床医生的职业熬熬对高强度监护室的患者安全构成重大威胁，现有研究主要依靠回顾性问卷或广泛的EHR元数据，忽视了临床记录中的迷人叙事信息。

Method: 分析MIMIC-IV数据库中10,000份ICU出院摘要，使用混合流水线：细调BioBERT情感嵌入、专门的词汇压力识别库、5主题LDA分析和工作负荷代理指标，最终通过提供者级别逻辑回归分类器进行预测。

Result: 在分层预留集上达到预精度0.80、召回0.89、F1分数0.84的性能，超过仅使用元数据的基准方法至少0.17个F1分数。专业特异性分析显示放射科、精神病学和神经科的医护人员熬熬风险更高。

Conclusion: ICU临床记录中含有可操作的信号，可用于主动的健康状况监测，为预防性的医护人员健康管理提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Clinician burnout poses a substantial threat to patient safety, particularly
in high-acuity intensive care units (ICUs). Existing research predominantly
relies on retrospective survey tools or broad electronic health record (EHR)
metadata, often overlooking the valuable narrative information embedded in
clinical notes. In this study, we analyze 10,000 ICU discharge summaries from
MIMIC-IV, a publicly available database derived from the electronic health
records of Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. The dataset encompasses
diverse patient data, including vital signs, medical orders, diagnoses,
procedures, treatments, and deidentified free-text clinical notes. We introduce
a hybrid pipeline that combines BioBERT sentiment embeddings fine-tuned for
clinical narratives, a lexical stress lexicon tailored for clinician burnout
surveillance, and five-topic latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) with workload
proxies. A provider-level logistic regression classifier achieves a precision
of 0.80, a recall of 0.89, and an F1 score of 0.84 on a stratified hold-out
set, surpassing metadata-only baselines by greater than or equal to 0.17 F1
score. Specialty-specific analysis indicates elevated burnout risk among
providers in Radiology, Psychiatry, and Neurology. Our findings demonstrate
that ICU clinical narratives contain actionable signals for proactive
well-being monitoring.

TL;DR: 研究发现开源大语言模型在大学推荐中存在严重的地理、人口和经济偏见，偏向全球北方国家机构并强化性别刻板印象，提出了新的多维度评估框架来量化这些偏见问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型被广泛用于教育规划等日常推荐任务，其推荐结果可能延续社会偏见，需要实证研究这些偏见以确保高等教育机会的公平性。

Method: 使用360个模拟用户配置文件（基于性别、国籍和经济状况变化），分析三个开源LLM（LLaMA-3.1-8B、Gemma-7B、Mistral-7B）生成的25,000多条大学和专业推荐，提出多维度评估框架来衡量人口和地理代表性。

Result: 结果显示强烈偏见：全球北方机构被过度偏爱，推荐经常强化性别刻板印象，机构重复现象普遍。LLaMA-3.1多样性最高，推荐了58个国家的481所独特大学，但系统性差异仍然存在。

Conclusion: 研究强调了在教育大语言模型中考虑偏见的紧迫性，以确保全球高等教育的公平获取，提出的评估框架为量化这些偏见问题提供了新方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used as daily recommendation
systems for tasks like education planning, yet their recommendations risk
perpetuating societal biases. This paper empirically examines geographic,
demographic, and economic biases in university and program suggestions from
three open-source LLMs: LLaMA-3.1-8B, Gemma-7B, and Mistral-7B. Using 360
simulated user profiles varying by gender, nationality, and economic status, we
analyze over 25,000 recommendations. Results show strong biases: institutions
in the Global North are disproportionately favored, recommendations often
reinforce gender stereotypes, and institutional repetition is prevalent. While
LLaMA-3.1 achieves the highest diversity, recommending 481 unique universities
across 58 countries, systemic disparities persist. To quantify these issues, we
propose a novel, multi-dimensional evaluation framework that goes beyond
accuracy by measuring demographic and geographic representation. Our findings
highlight the urgent need for bias consideration in educational LMs to ensure
equitable global access to higher education.

TL;DR: DeepTRACE是一个新颖的社会技术审计框架，用于评估生成式搜索引擎和深度研究LLM代理在答案文本、来源和引用方面的八个可测量维度，发现这些系统经常产生片面、过度自信且缺乏来源支持的回应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式搜索引擎和深度研究LLM代理虽然承诺提供可信的、基于来源的综合信息，但用户经常遇到过度自信、来源支持薄弱和引用实践混乱的问题，需要系统化的审计框架来评估和改进。

Method: 使用语句级分析（分解、置信度评分）构建引用和事实支持矩阵，通过自动化提取管道评估流行公共模型（GPT-4.5/5、You.com等），并采用与人类评分者验证一致的LLM法官进行评价。

Result: 生成式搜索引擎和深度研究代理在辩论查询中经常产生片面、高度自信的回应，且包含大量缺乏来源支持的陈述。深度研究配置虽然减少了过度自信并实现了高引用完整性，但在辩论查询中仍然高度片面，引用准确率在40-80%之间。

Conclusion: 当前生成式搜索和深度研究系统在引用准确性和事实支持方面存在显著缺陷，需要改进引用实践和证据推理能力，DeepTRACE框架为系统化评估和提升这些能力提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Generative search engines and deep research LLM agents promise trustworthy,
source-grounded synthesis, yet users regularly encounter overconfidence, weak
sourcing, and confusing citation practices. We introduce DeepTRACE, a novel
sociotechnically grounded audit framework that turns prior community-identified
failure cases into eight measurable dimensions spanning answer text, sources,
and citations. DeepTRACE uses statement-level analysis (decomposition,
confidence scoring) and builds citation and factual-support matrices to audit
how systems reason with and attribute evidence end-to-end. Using automated
extraction pipelines for popular public models (e.g., GPT-4.5/5, You.com,
Perplexity, Copilot/Bing, Gemini) and an LLM-judge with validated agreement to
human raters, we evaluate both web-search engines and deep-research
configurations. Our findings show that generative search engines and deep
research agents frequently produce one-sided, highly confident responses on
debate queries and include large fractions of statements unsupported by their
own listed sources. Deep-research configurations reduce overconfidence and can
attain high citation thoroughness, but they remain highly one-sided on debate
queries and still exhibit large fractions of unsupported statements, with
citation accuracy ranging from 40--80% across systems.

TL;DR: LLMs在处理混合上下文时倾向于采纳较少出现的信息，即使是不相关内容，这带来了可靠性风险。研究提出了Poisoned Context Testbed和基于Rescorla-Wagner模型的RW-Steering方法，通过微调使模型能够识别并忽略不适当内容。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的上下文往往混合相关和不相关内容，LLMs在处理这种混合上下文时存在可靠性风险，需要研究其处理机制并开发解决方案。

Method: 引入Poisoned Context Testbed测试平台，采用神经科学中的Rescorla-Wagner模型量化竞争性上下文信号对LLM输出的影响，并提出RW-Steering两阶段微调方法。

Result: 实验显示LLMs确实倾向于采纳较少出现的信息，RW-Steering方法将响应质量提高了39.8%，并逆转了不良行为曲线。

Conclusion: RW-Steering是一种鲁棒、可泛化的上下文工程解决方案，能够有效提高LLM在现实世界使用中的安全性。

Abstract: Incorporating external context can significantly enhance the response quality
of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, real-world contexts often mix
relevant information with disproportionate inappropriate content, posing
reliability risks. How do LLMs process and prioritize mixed context? To study
this, we introduce the Poisoned Context Testbed, pairing queries with
real-world contexts containing relevant and inappropriate content. Inspired by
associative learning in animals, we adapt the Rescorla-Wagner (RW) model from
neuroscience to quantify how competing contextual signals influence LLM
outputs. Our adapted model reveals a consistent behavioral pattern: LLMs
exhibit a strong tendency to incorporate information that is less prevalent in
the context. This susceptibility is harmful in real-world settings, where small
amounts of inappropriate content can substantially degrade response quality.
Empirical evaluations on our testbed further confirm this vulnerability. To
tackle this, we introduce RW-Steering, a two-stage finetuning-based approach
that enables the model to internally identify and ignore inappropriate signals.
Unlike prior methods that rely on extensive supervision across diverse context
mixtures, RW-Steering generalizes robustly across varying proportions of
inappropriate content. Experiments show that our best fine-tuned model improves
response quality by 39.8% and reverses the undesirable behavior curve,
establishing RW-Steering as a robust, generalizable context engineering
solution for improving LLM safety in real-world use.

Conclusion: 该论文为指令微调领域提供了一个系统的教学资源，通过简化表达和专业针对性提高了学习效果，并且提出了新的GRAPE研究方向。

Abstract: This paper provides a self-contained, from-scratch, exposition of key
algorithms for instruction tuning of models: SFT, Rejection Sampling,
REINFORCE, Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO), Proximal Policy
Optimization (PPO), Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), and Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO). Explanations of these algorithms often assume
prior knowledge, lack critical details, and/or are overly generalized and
complex. Here, each method is discussed and developed step by step using
simplified and explicit notation focused on LLMs, aiming to eliminate ambiguity
and provide a clear and intuitive understanding of the concepts. By minimizing
detours into the broader RL literature and connecting concepts to LLMs, we
eliminate superfluous abstractions and reduce cognitive overhead. Following
this exposition, we provide a literature review of new techniques and
approaches beyond those detailed. Finally, new ideas for research and
exploration in the form of GRAPE (Generalized Relative Advantage Policy

Motivation: 现有RAG系统的检索器精度不足，许多检索到的样本不相关或具有误导性，成为LLMs性能的关键瓶颈。

Method: 1) 使用不同正负样本比例的基准测试评估模型；2) 通过思维链分析提升样本判别能力；3) 提出Partial-GRPO方法，将LLM输出建模为多个组件而非单一整体，增强复杂思维链内容的学习能力。

Result: 在VaccineRAG上的综合评估和消融研究验证了所提方案的有效性。

Conclusion: VaccineRAG能够系统性地暴露当前LLMs的固有弱点，并通过思维链分析和Partial-GRPO方法显著提升模型在检索增强生成任务中的性能。

Abstract: Retrieval Augmented Generation enhances the response accuracy of Large
Language Models (LLMs) by integrating retrieval and generation modules with
external knowledge, demonstrating particular strength in real-time queries and
Visual Question Answering tasks. However, the effectiveness of RAG is
frequently hindered by the precision of the retriever: many retrieved samples
fed into the generation phase are irrelevant or misleading, posing a critical
bottleneck to LLMs' performance. To address this challenge, we introduce
VaccineRAG, a novel Chain-of-Thought-based retrieval-augmented generation
dataset. On one hand, VaccineRAG employs a benchmark to evaluate models using
data with varying positive/negative sample ratios, systematically exposing
inherent weaknesses in current LLMs. On the other hand, it enhances models'
sample-discrimination capabilities by prompting LLMs to generate explicit
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) analysis for each sample before producing final answers.
Furthermore, to enhance the model's ability to learn long-sequence complex CoT
content, we propose Partial-GRPO. By modeling the outputs of LLMs as multiple
components rather than a single whole, our model can make more informed
preference selections for complex sequences, thereby enhancing its capacity to
learn complex CoT. Comprehensive evaluations and ablation studies on VaccineRAG
validate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme. The code and dataset will be
publicly released soon.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的LLM测试基准主要关注性能指标，无法抓取模型之间的细微行为差异，需要一种更全面的评估方法来分析模型的内在认知和交互风格。

Method: 使用经过精心筛选的"诊断提示套装"和自动化评估流水线，让强大的LLM执行公正判断，对十八个不同能力层次的模型进行分析。

Result: 研究发现顶级模型在核心能力（如抽象和因果推理）上呈现收敛趋势，但在对齐相关行为（如奉承性和语义稳健性）方面存在显著差异。同时识别出了跨模型的默认人设聚类（ISTJ/ESTJ）。

Conclusion: 模型的交互性质不是规模或推理能力的出现性质，而是开发者具体对齐策略的直接结果。该框架提供了可复现和可扩展的方法来揭示这些深层行为差异。

Abstract: Current benchmarks for Large Language Models (LLMs) primarily focus on
performance metrics, often failing to capture the nuanced behavioral
characteristics that differentiate them. This paper introduces a novel
``Behavioral Fingerprinting'' framework designed to move beyond traditional
evaluation by creating a multi-faceted profile of a model's intrinsic cognitive
and interactive styles. Using a curated \textit{Diagnostic Prompt Suite} and an
innovative, automated evaluation pipeline where a powerful LLM acts as an
impartial judge, we analyze eighteen models across capability tiers. Our
results reveal a critical divergence in the LLM landscape: while core
capabilities like abstract and causal reasoning are converging among top
models, alignment-related behaviors such as sycophancy and semantic robustness
vary dramatically. We further document a cross-model default persona clustering
(ISTJ/ESTJ) that likely reflects common alignment incentives. Taken together,
this suggests that a model's interactive nature is not an emergent property of
its scale or reasoning power, but a direct consequence of specific, and highly
variable, developer alignment strategies. Our framework provides a reproducible
and scalable methodology for uncovering these deep behavioral differences.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出一种结合变换器音响模型和大语言模型的语音识别框架，显著提升沉默语音接口的识别准确性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 沉默语音接口合成的语音存在音位歧义和噪声问题，现有方法在识别和下游处理方面有限

Method: 使用变换器基础的音响模型捕捉全屏语境，结合大语言模型进行后处理以确保语言一致性

Result: 实验结果显示词误率相对36%的基准线相对降低16%（绝对降低6%）

Conclusion: 该框架能够实现对沉默语音接口合成语音的显著改善和提升可读性

Abstract: Silent Speech Interfaces (SSIs) have gained attention for their ability to
generate intelligible speech from non-acoustic signals. While significant
progress has been made in advancing speech generation pipelines, limited work
has addressed the recognition and downstream processing of synthesized speech,
which often suffers from phonetic ambiguity and noise. To overcome these
challenges, we propose an enhanced automatic speech recognition framework that
combines a transformer-based acoustic model with a large language model (LLM)
for post-processing. The transformer captures full utterance context, while the
LLM ensures linguistic consistency. Experimental results show a 16% relative
and 6% absolute reduction in word error rate (WER) over a 36% baseline,
demonstrating substantial improvements in intelligibility for silent speech
interfaces.

TL;DR: 通过渐进子任务训练策略，多代理小语言模型系统在AppWorld环境中实现了更好的效果-效率交换，解决了小模型在长轨迹学习中的性能限制


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究多代理小语言模型系统与单代理大模型系统在处理复杂问题时的效果和效率对比，寻找更优的效果-效率交换方案

Method: 在AppWorld环境中实例化单代理和多代理系统，使用不同规模的语言模型。提出渐进子任务训练策略，在每个训练时期渐进地引入新子任务，类似于实例级课程学习

Result: 渐进训练策略一致提高了多代理系统在所有配置下的效果。细调后的多代理系统实现了更好的效果-效率交换。测试显示该策略能够降低子任务错误率

Conclusion: 多代理小语言模型系统通过渐进子任务训练策略，可以充分发挥小模型的潜力，在处理复杂问题时实现比单代理大模型系统更优的效果-效率平衡

Abstract: Multi-agent systems with smaller language models (SLMs) present a viable
alternative to single agent systems powered by large language models (LLMs) for
addressing complex problems. In this work, we study how these alternatives
compare in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency. To study this trade-off,
we instantiate single and multi-agent systems for the complex problems in the
AppWorld environment using different sized language models.
  We find that difficulties with long-trajectory learning in smaller language
models (SLMs) limit their performance. Even when trained for specialized roles,
SLMs fail to learn all subtasks effectively. To address this issue, we
introduce a simple progressive sub-task training strategy, which introduces new
sub-tasks progressively in each training epoch. We find that this novel
strategy, analogous to instance level curriculum learning, consistently
improves the effectiveness of multi-agents at all configurations. Our Pareto
analysis shows that fine-tuned multi-agent systems yield better
effectiveness-efficiency trade-offs. Additional ablations and analyses shows
the importance of our progressive training strategy and its ability to reduce
subtask error rates.

TL;DR: 使用VR和AI技术通过静默阅读测试和自尊评估来预测意大利和西班牙大学生的阅读障碍，机器学习模型分类准确率达到75-87.5%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索虚拟现实和人工智能技术是否能够有效预测大学生的阅读障碍，为阅读障碍评估提供新的技术支持工具

Method: 采用VR静默阅读测试和自尊评估收集数据，先进行统计检验(t检验和Mann Whitney检验)，然后使用监督机器学习算法进行分类建模

Result: 静默阅读测试完成时间存在显著差异，但准确性和自尊评分无差异。机器学习分类准确率：意大利87.5%、西班牙66.6%、合并组75.0%

Conclusion: VR和机器学习可作为阅读障碍评估的辅助工具，主要通过捕捉任务完成速度差异，但语言特异性因素会影响分类准确性

Abstract: This study explores the use of virtual reality (VR) and artificial
intelligence (AI) to predict the presence of dyslexia in Italian and Spanish
university students. In particular, the research investigates whether
VR-derived data from Silent Reading (SR) tests and self-esteem assessments can
differentiate between students that are affected by dyslexia and students that
are not, employing machine learning (ML) algorithms. Participants completed
VR-based tasks measuring reading performance and self-esteem. A preliminary
statistical analysis (t tests and Mann Whitney tests) on these data was
performed, to compare the obtained scores between individuals with and without
dyslexia, revealing significant differences in completion time for the SR test,
but not in accuracy, nor in self esteem. Then, supervised ML models were
trained and tested, demonstrating an ability to classify the presence/absence
of dyslexia with an accuracy of 87.5 per cent for Italian, 66.6 per cent for
Spanish, and 75.0 per cent for the pooled group. These findings suggest that VR
and ML can effectively be used as supporting tools for assessing dyslexia,
particularly by capturing differences in task completion speed, but
language-specific factors may influence classification accuracy.

*Edoardo Pinzuti,Oliver Tüscher,André Ferreira Castro*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究大型语言模型在处理情感敏感内容时的扩展行为，重点关注情绪安全分类任务，发现大模型在零样本设置下表现更好，但轻量级微调后的小模型也能达到相近性能，适合隐私敏感的本地部署。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解LLM如何处理情感敏感内容对于构建安全可靠的系统至关重要，特别是在心理健康应用中需要确保对话安全性。

Method: 构建包含15K+样本的新数据集，评估四个LLaMA模型(1B-70B)在零样本、少样本和微调设置下的表现，包括三元情绪安全分类和多标签安全风险分类任务。

Result: 大模型在平均性能上更强，特别是在零样本设置和复杂多标签分类中。但经过轻量级微调后，1B小模型在多个高数据类别中能达到与大模型和BERT相当的性能，且推理时仅需<2GB显存。

Conclusion: 小型设备端模型可以作为隐私保护的可行替代方案，具备解释情感上下文和维持安全对话边界的能力，对治疗性LLM应用和安全关键系统的可扩展对齐具有重要意义。

Abstract: Understanding how large language models (LLMs) process emotionally sensitive
content is critical for building safe and reliable systems, particularly in
mental health contexts. We investigate the scaling behavior of LLMs on two key
tasks: trinary classification of emotional safety (safe vs. unsafe vs.
borderline) and multi-label classification using a six-category safety risk
taxonomy. To support this, we construct a novel dataset by merging several
human-authored mental health datasets (> 15K samples) and augmenting them with
emotion re-interpretation prompts generated via ChatGPT. We evaluate four LLaMA
models (1B, 3B, 8B, 70B) across zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuning settings.
Our results show that larger LLMs achieve stronger average performance,
particularly in nuanced multi-label classification and in zero-shot settings.
However, lightweight fine-tuning allowed the 1B model to achieve performance
comparable to larger models and BERT in several high-data categories, while
requiring <2GB VRAM at inference. These findings suggest that smaller,
on-device models can serve as viable, privacy-preserving alternatives for
sensitive applications, offering the ability to interpret emotional context and
maintain safe conversational boundaries. This work highlights key implications
for therapeutic LLM applications and the scalable alignment of safety-critical
systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出BAME方法，通过模型生成的解释来指导提示工程，有效减少AI生成职业故事中的性别和种族偏见，在不修改模型参数的情况下将人口统计代表性提高了2%-20%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语言模型在输出中传播社会偏见，特别是在性别和种族表征方面。本文旨在调查AI生成职业故事中的性别和种族偏见，并提出有效的缓解策略。

Method: 提出BAME（Bias Analysis and Mitigation through Explanation）方法，利用模型生成的解释来指导有针对性的提示工程，分析25个职业群体、3个大语言模型（Claude 3.5 Sonnet、Llama 3.1 70B Instruct、GPT-4 Turbo）和多个人口统计维度生成的故事。

Result: 应用BAME后，人口统计代表性改善了2%-20%，识别出与训练数据刻板印象相关的过度代表和不足代表的持续模式。

Conclusion: 通过引导模型使用其内部推理机制可以显著提高人口统计平等性，有助于开发更透明的生成式AI系统。

Abstract: Language models have been shown to propagate social bias through their
output, particularly in the representation of gender and ethnicity. This paper
investigates gender and ethnicity biases in AI-generated occupational stories.
Representation biases are measured before and after applying our proposed
mitigation strategy, Bias Analysis and Mitigation through Explanation (BAME),
revealing improvements in demographic representation ranging from 2% to 20%.
BAME leverages model-generated explanations to inform targeted prompt
engineering, effectively reducing biases without modifying model parameters. By
analyzing stories generated across 25 occupational groups, three large language
models (Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Llama 3.1 70B Instruct, and GPT-4 Turbo), and
multiple demographic dimensions, we identify persistent patterns of
overrepresentation and underrepresentation linked to training data stereotypes.
Our findings demonstrate that guiding models with their own internal reasoning
mechanisms can significantly enhance demographic parity, thereby contributing
to the development of more transparent generative AI systems.

### [99] [Artificially Fluent: Swahili AI Performance Benchmarks Between English-Trained and Natively-Trained Datasets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04516)
*Sophie Jaffer,Simeon Sayer*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，尽管使用高质量翻译，但原生斯瓦希里语训练的模型性能优于斯瓦希里语到英语的翻译模型，错误率低近四倍，表明翻译不能完全弥补语言间的表征差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型语言模型扩展多语言能力，需要测试英语在训练数据中的主导地位是否会导致非英语使用者的性能劣势，验证数据差异对模型性能的影响。

Method: 比较两个单语BERT模型：一个完全在斯瓦希里语数据上训练和测试，另一个在可比英语新闻数据上训练。通过将斯瓦希里语新闻数据翻译成英语，使用英语训练模型进行评估，测试语言一致性与跨语言抽象的效果。

Result: 原生斯瓦希里语训练模型表现更好，错误率为0.36%，而翻译模型的错误率为1.47%，相差近四倍。

Conclusion: 翻译不能完全弥合语言间的表征差异，原生语言训练对可靠结果仍然重要。未来研究应关注 underrepresented 语言的数据集开发和 multilingual 模型评估，以减少全球AI部署对现有数字鸿沟的强化效应。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) expand multilingual capabilities, questions
remain about the equity of their performance across languages. While many
communities stand to benefit from AI systems, the dominance of English in
training data risks disadvantaging non-English speakers. To test the hypothesis
that such data disparities may affect model performance, this study compares
two monolingual BERT models: one trained and tested entirely on Swahili data,
and another on comparable English news data. To simulate how multilingual LLMs
process non-English queries through internal translation and abstraction, we
translated the Swahili news data into English and evaluated it using the
English-trained model. This approach tests the hypothesis by evaluating whether
translating Swahili inputs for evaluation on an English model yields better or
worse performance compared to training and testing a model entirely in Swahili,
thus isolating the effect of language consistency versus cross-lingual
abstraction. The results prove that, despite high-quality translation, the
native Swahili-trained model performed better than the Swahili-to-English
translated model, producing nearly four times fewer errors: 0.36% vs. 1.47%
respectively. This gap suggests that translation alone does not bridge
representational differences between languages and that models trained in one
language may struggle to accurately interpret translated inputs due to
imperfect internal knowledge representation, suggesting that native-language
training remains important for reliable outcomes. In educational and
informational contexts, even small performance gaps may compound inequality.
Future research should focus on addressing broader dataset development for
underrepresented languages and renewed attention to multilingual model
evaluation, ensuring the reinforcing effect of global AI deployment on existing
digital divides is reduced.

Motivation: 网片果植入手术后的复杂症是重要关注问题，需要了解患者手术后的情感体验和情绪变化，以改善本前未症咨询和手术后护理。

Method: 使用NRC情绪词典和TextBlob进行情感分析，将患者叙述分类为8种情绪（愤怒、恐惧、预期、信任、惊讶、悲伤、喜悦、厌厌），并评估情感极性。

Result: 发现2011-2012年和2017-2018年间关注报告和情绪强度显著增加，通过时间分析提供了有价值的患者体验洞察。

Conclusion: 研究强调了情感考量在医疗实践中的重要性，情感分析有潜力为改善患者护理提供信息支持。

Abstract: Mesh implants are widely utilized in hernia repair surgeries, but
postoperative complications present a significant concern. This study analyzes
patient reports from the Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience
(MAUDE) database spanning 2000 to 2021 to investigate the emotional aspects of
patients following mesh implantation using Natural Language Processing (NLP).
Employing the National Research Council Canada (NRC) Emotion Lexicon and
TextBlob for sentiment analysis, the research categorizes patient narratives
into eight emotions (anger, fear, anticipation, trust, surprise, sadness, joy,
and disgust) and assesses sentiment polarity. The goal is to discern patterns
in patient sentiment over time and to identify reports signaling urgent
concerns, referred to as "Concern Reports," thereby understanding shifts in
patient experiences in relation to changes in medical device regulation and
technological advancements in healthcare. The study detected an increase in
Concern Reports and higher emotional intensity during the periods of 2011-2012
and 2017-2018. Through temporal analysis of Concern Reports and overall
sentiment, this research provides valuable insights for healthcare
practitioners, enhancing their understanding of patient experiences
post-surgery, which is critical for improving preoperative counselling,
postoperative care, and preparing patients for mesh implant surgeries. The
study underscores the importance of emotional considerations in medical
practices and the potential for sentiment analysis to inform and enhance
patient care.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 使用强化学习（特别是GRPO方法）提升小型语言模型在工具使用方面的能力，解决SLMs相比LLMs在工具使用上的性能差距问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在工具使用方面表现出色，但计算资源需求高。小型语言模型虽然更紧凑高效，但在工具使用能力上明显不足，需要找到有效方法来提升SLMs的工具使用 proficiency

Method: 采用强化学习方法，具体使用Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)技术来训练小型语言模型，相比传统的微调方法更高效且具有更好的适应性

Result: 该方法显著提升了小型语言模型的工具使用准确率，增强了其实际应用价值

Conclusion: 强化学习特别是GRPO方法为提升小型语言模型的工具使用能力提供了高效有效的解决方案，使SLMs在保持紧凑性的同时获得更好的工具使用性能

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have progressed beyond simple text creation, and
tool use has become increasingly important for complex, real-world tasks. Tool
use in LLMs refers to their ability to utilize external resources such as APIs,
databases, or software functions to extend their functionality beyond
generating text.Tools are used for tasks such as performing calculations,
making API calls to retrieve the current time and date, and more. This
capability enables models to fetch real-time data, execute commands, or solve
problems requiring dynamic interaction, making it indispensable for
applications like AI agents in virtual assistants, robotic control, or
automated workflows.
  However, while LLMs are usually adept tool use, their vast resource
requirements and computation complexity restrict their use in every use case.As
a result, there is an increasing need for more compact and efficient Small
Language Models (SLMs). Small language models (SLMs) struggle in tool use
compared to large language models (LLMs). As soon in Table 1. SLMs are
typically trained on smaller, more specific datasets, resulting in a narrower
knowledge base and limited contextual understanding compared to LLMs.
  This research addresses these challenges by using Reinforcement Learning
(RL), specifically Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), to enhance
tool-use proficiency in SLMs. Unlike conventional fine-tuning approaches that
require heavy computation and often lack adaptability, our method provides an
efficient, effective solution that significantly boosts SLM tool-use accuracy,
increasing their practical utility.

Motivation: 从放射学报告中提取结构化临床信息具有挑战性，特别是在低资源语言和克罗恩病这种多器官发现稀疏表示的情况下

Method: 基于提示的HSMP-BERT模型，使用分层结构化匹配预测方法，在9683份希伯来语放射学报告数据集上进行训练和测试

Result: 在24个器官-发现组合上，平均F1得分0.83±0.08，Cohen's κ 0.65±0.17，显著优于基线方法，分层推理将运行时间减少5.1倍

Conclusion: HSMP-BERT为放射学结构化提取提供了可扩展的解决方案，展示了AI在低资源环境中的潜力，可用于克罗恩病的群体水平分析

Abstract: Extracting structured clinical information from radiology reports is
challenging, especially in low-resource languages. This is pronounced in
Crohn's disease, with sparsely represented multi-organ findings. We developed
Hierarchical Structured Matching Prediction BERT (HSMP-BERT), a prompt-based
model for extraction from Hebrew radiology text. In an administrative database
study, we analyzed 9,683 reports from Crohn's patients imaged 2010-2023 across
Israeli providers. A subset of 512 reports was radiologist-annotated for
findings across six gastrointestinal organs and 15 pathologies, yielding 90
structured labels per subject. Multilabel-stratified split (66%
train+validation; 33% test), preserving label prevalence. Performance was
evaluated with accuracy, F1, Cohen's $\kappa$, AUC, PPV, NPV, and recall. On 24
organ-finding combinations with $>$15 positives, HSMP-BERT achieved mean F1
0.83$\pm$0.08 and $\kappa$ 0.65$\pm$0.17, outperforming the SMP zero-shot
baseline (F1 0.49$\pm$0.07, $\kappa$ 0.06$\pm$0.07) and standard fine-tuning
(F1 0.30$\pm$0.27, $\kappa$ 0.27$\pm$0.34; paired t-test $p < 10^{-7}$).
Hierarchical inference cuts runtime 5.1$\times$ vs. traditional inference.
Applied to all reports, it revealed associations among ileal wall thickening,
stenosis, and pre-stenotic dilatation, plus age- and sex-specific trends in
inflammatory findings. HSMP-BERT offers a scalable solution for structured
extraction in radiology, enabling population-level analysis of Crohn's disease
and demonstrating AI's potential in low-resource settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 哨利亚长期武装冲突缺乏系统性暴力记录，导致公开信息和历史记述的缺失，需要构建历史记忆。

Method: 使用GPT大语言模型阅读和回答超过20万份西班牙语暴力相关报纸文章，构建数据集并进行描述性分析和因果关系研究。

Conclusion: 大语言模型为大规模文本语料深度分析开启了新的研究可能性，能够在以前无法实现的层面进行研究。

Abstract: Colombia has been submerged in decades of armed conflict, yet until recently,
the systematic documentation of violence was not a priority for the Colombian
government. This has resulted in a lack of publicly available conflict
information and, consequently, a lack of historical accounts. This study
contributes to Colombia's historical memory by utilizing GPT, a large language
model (LLM), to read and answer questions about over 200,000 violence-related
newspaper articles in Spanish. We use the resulting dataset to conduct both
descriptive analysis and a study of the relationship between violence and the
eradication of coca crops, offering an example of policy analyses that such
data can support. Our study demonstrates how LLMs have opened new research
opportunities by enabling examinations of large text corpora at a previously
infeasible depth.

Abstract: Large language models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in biomedical
natural language processing, yet their rapid growth in size and computational
requirements present a major barrier to adoption in healthcare settings where
data privacy precludes cloud deployment and resources are limited. In this
study, we systematically evaluated the impact of quantization on 12
state-of-the-art large language models, including both general-purpose and
biomedical-specific models, across eight benchmark datasets covering four key
tasks: named entity recognition, relation extraction, multi-label
classification, and question answering. We show that quantization substantially
reduces GPU memory requirements-by up to 75%-while preserving model performance
across diverse tasks, enabling the deployment of 70B-parameter models on 40GB
consumer-grade GPUs. In addition, domain-specific knowledge and responsiveness
to advanced prompting methods are largely maintained. These findings provide
significant practical and guiding value, highlighting quantization as a
practical and effective strategy for enabling the secure, local deployment of
large yet high-capacity language models in biomedical contexts, bridging the
gap between technical advances in AI and real-world clinical translation.

Motivation: Transformer语言模型在NLP任务中表现出色，但精细控制仍然具有挑战性。需要开发系统性的方法来操纵模型行为，同时考虑鲁棒性和安全性。

Method: 将可控文本生成形式化为优化问题，采用提示工程、参数高效微调、模型编辑和强化学习等方法，构建包含提示层引导、激活干预和权重空间编辑的统一框架。

Result: 理论上证明最小权重更新可实现目标行为改变且副作用有限；实证显示在情感控制和事实编辑方面成功率超过90%，同时保持基础性能，但存在泛化-特异性权衡。

Conclusion: 这项工作为设计可控且鲁棒的语言模型奠定了基础，同时讨论了伦理双重使用风险，强调需要严格的评估机制。

Abstract: Transformer-based language models excel in NLP tasks, but fine-grained
control remains challenging. This paper explores methods for manipulating
transformer models through principled interventions at three levels: prompts,
activations, and weights. We formalize controllable text generation as an
optimization problem addressable via prompt engineering, parameter-efficient
fine-tuning, model editing, and reinforcement learning. We introduce a unified
framework encompassing prompt-level steering, activation interventions, and
weight-space edits. We analyze robustness and safety implications, including
adversarial attacks and alignment mitigations. Theoretically, we show minimal
weight updates can achieve targeted behavior changes with limited side-effects.
Empirically, we demonstrate >90% success in sentiment control and factual edits
while preserving base performance, though generalization-specificity trade-offs
exist. We discuss ethical dual-use risks and the need for rigorous evaluation.
This work lays groundwork for designing controllable and robust language
models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文是关于语音讽刺识别的系统综述，首次聚焦于基于语音的讽刺识别，涵盖了从单模态到多模态方法的演变，包括数据集、特征提取和分类方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 讽刺是人类交流的常见特征，在人际互动和人机交互中带来挑战。虽然之前的研究主要关注基于文本的讽刺检测，但语音数据在识别讽刺方面的作用尚未得到充分探索。利用语音数据进行自动讽刺识别可以增强神经退行性疾病患者的社交互动，并改善机器对复杂人类语言使用的理解。

Result: 研究发现包括讽刺识别语音数据集的局限性、特征提取技术从传统声学特征到深度学习表示的演变，以及分类方法从单模态方法到多模态融合技术的进展。

Conclusion: 研究指出了需要更加重视跨文化和多语言讽刺识别的重要性，以及将讽刺视为多模态现象而非基于文本的挑战的必要性。

Abstract: Sarcasm, a common feature of human communication, poses challenges in
interpersonal interactions and human-machine interactions. Linguistic research
has highlighted the importance of prosodic cues, such as variations in pitch,
speaking rate, and intonation, in conveying sarcastic intent. Although previous
work has focused on text-based sarcasm detection, the role of speech data in
recognizing sarcasm has been underexplored. Recent advancements in speech
technology emphasize the growing importance of leveraging speech data for
automatic sarcasm recognition, which can enhance social interactions for
individuals with neurodegenerative conditions and improve machine understanding
of complex human language use, leading to more nuanced interactions. This
systematic review is the first to focus on speech-based sarcasm recognition,
charting the evolution from unimodal to multimodal approaches. It covers
datasets, feature extraction, and classification methods, and aims to bridge
gaps across diverse research domains. The findings include limitations in
datasets for sarcasm recognition in speech, the evolution of feature extraction
techniques from traditional acoustic features to deep learning-based
representations, and the progression of classification methods from unimodal
approaches to multimodal fusion techniques. In so doing, we identify the need
for greater emphasis on cross-cultural and multilingual sarcasm recognition, as
well as the importance of addressing sarcasm as a multimodal phenomenon, rather
than a text-based challenge.

Motivation: 多模态基础模型需要处理不断演变的多种模态，但从头训练不现实，现有方法需要大量配对数据，而低资源模态往往缺乏这样的数据

Method: 设计超网络来适配共享投影器，通过等距变换增加训练模态多样性，利用高资源模态训练超网络，推理时使用任意模态的少量样本生成适配器

Conclusion: SEMI有潜力扩展基础模型的模态覆盖范围，为低资源模态集成提供了高效的解决方案

Abstract: Multimodal foundation models can process several modalities. However, since
the space of possible modalities is large and evolving over time, training a
model from scratch to encompass all modalities is unfeasible. Moreover,
integrating a modality into a pre-existing foundation model currently requires
a significant amount of paired data, which is often not available for
low-resource modalities. In this paper, we introduce a method for
sample-efficient modality integration (SEMI) into Large Language Models (LLMs).
To this end, we devise a hypernetwork that can adapt a shared projector --
placed between modality-specific encoders and an LLM -- to any modality. The
hypernetwork, trained on high-resource modalities (i.e., text, speech, audio,
video), is conditioned on a few samples from any arbitrary modality at
inference time to generate a suitable adapter. To increase the diversity of
training modalities, we artificially multiply the number of encoders through
isometric transformations. We find that SEMI achieves a significant boost in
sample efficiency during few-shot integration of new modalities (i.e.,
satellite images, astronomical images, inertial measurements, and molecules)
with encoders of arbitrary embedding dimensionality. For instance, to reach the
same accuracy as 32-shot SEMI, training the projector from scratch needs
64$\times$ more data. As a result, SEMI holds promise to extend the modality
coverage of foundation models.

Conclusion: 这项调查为研究社区构建下一代安全LLM提供了重要参考，旨在开发出能够抵抗未经授权蒸馏、微调和编辑的鲁棒模型。

Abstract: The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) has introduced critical
security challenges, where adversarial actors can manipulate input prompts to
cause significant harm and circumvent safety alignments. These prompt-based
attacks exploit vulnerabilities in a model's design, training, and contextual
understanding, leading to intellectual property theft, misinformation
generation, and erosion of user trust. A systematic understanding of these
attack vectors is the foundational step toward developing robust
countermeasures. This paper presents a comprehensive literature survey of
prompt-based attack methodologies, categorizing them to provide a clear threat
model. By detailing the mechanisms and impacts of these exploits, this survey
aims to inform the research community's efforts in building the next generation
of secure LLMs that are inherently resistant to unauthorized distillation,
fine-tuning, and editing.

### [109] [Comparative Analysis of Transformer Models in Disaster Tweet Classification for Public Safety](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04650)
*Sharif Noor Zisad,Ragib Hasan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 基于Transformer的模型（如BERT）在灾难相关推文分类任务上显著优于传统机器学习方法，准确率达到91%，比逻辑回归和朴素贝叶斯的82%高出9个百分点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体已成为灾害和公共安全紧急情况下的重要实时信息来源。自动分类灾害相关推文可以帮助应急服务更快、更有效地响应。传统机器学习模型在处理非正式、隐喻性或模糊语言时往往无法理解上下文或深层含义。

Method: 评估了基于Transformer的模型（包括BERT、DistilBERT、RoBERTa和DeBERTa）在灾害推文分类任务上的效果，并与传统机器学习方法（逻辑回归、朴素贝叶斯、支持向量机）进行性能对比。

Result: BERT模型取得了最高准确率（91%），显著优于传统模型（逻辑回归和朴素贝叶斯均为82%）。Transformer模型通过上下文嵌入和注意力机制能够更好地理解推文中的微妙语言。

Conclusion: Transformer架构在公共安全应用中更为合适，提供了更高的准确性、更深入的语言理解和更好的现实世界社交媒体文本泛化能力。

Abstract: Twitter and other social media platforms have become vital sources of real
time information during disasters and public safety emergencies. Automatically
classifying disaster related tweets can help emergency services respond faster
and more effectively. Traditional Machine Learning (ML) models such as Logistic
Regression, Naive Bayes, and Support Vector Machines have been widely used for
this task, but they often fail to understand the context or deeper meaning of
words, especially when the language is informal, metaphorical, or ambiguous. We
posit that, in this context, transformer based models can perform better than
traditional ML models. In this paper, we evaluate the effectiveness of
transformer based models, including BERT, DistilBERT, RoBERTa, and DeBERTa, for
classifying disaster related tweets. These models are compared with traditional
ML approaches to highlight the performance gap. Experimental results show that
BERT achieved the highest accuracy (91%), significantly outperforming
traditional models like Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes (both at 82%). The
use of contextual embeddings and attention mechanisms allows transformer models
to better understand subtle language in tweets, where traditional ML models
fall short. This research demonstrates that transformer architectures are far
more suitable for public safety applications, offering improved accuracy,
deeper language understanding, and better generalization across real world
social media text.

TL;DR: 通过语音式归纳偏置（参数解耦和半监督学习）改善短语识别和未见手语重建质量，提高向量量化自动编码器的汉语手语表征学习的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有手语数据集词汇代表性不足，需要模型能够汉辫化到未见手语。向量量化是一种有前景的离散表征学习方法，但需要评估其学习的单元是否捕获了偏偏相关而影响外部词汇性能。

Method: 探索两种语音式归纳偏置：1）参数解耦（结构偏置）；2）语音半监督学习（正则化技术）。使用向量量化自动编码器进行定量分析。

Result: 所提出模型学习的表征在未见手语的一次重建和手语识别任务上更有效，与对照基准相比显示出更好的区分性能。

Conclusion: 这项工作提供了定量分析，证明明确的、语言学动机的偏置能够提高手语表征学习的汉辫化能力。

Abstract: Sign language datasets are often not representative in terms of vocabulary,
underscoring the need for models that generalize to unseen signs. Vector
quantization is a promising approach for learning discrete, token-like
representations, but it has not been evaluated whether the learned units
capture spurious correlations that hinder out-of-vocabulary performance. This
work investigates two phonological inductive biases: Parameter Disentanglement,
an architectural bias, and Phonological Semi-Supervision, a regularization
technique, to improve isolated sign recognition of known signs and
reconstruction quality of unseen signs with a vector-quantized autoencoder. The
primary finding is that the learned representations from the proposed model are
more effective for one-shot reconstruction of unseen signs and more
discriminative for sign identification compared to a controlled baseline. This
work provides a quantitative analysis of how explicit, linguistically-motivated
biases can improve the generalization of learned representations of sign
language.

Motivation: 细调后的专业LLM虽然在领域内任务上表现优异，但对外域输入容易产生错误或不可靠输出，在关键应用中带来风险

Method: 基于ICAD框架，使用模型dropout容忍度的新非遵循度量，偏向于领域内输入具有更高的dropout容忍度，通过多层集成提升检测性能

Result: 在医疗专业LLM上进行实验，方法在OOD检测上表现超过基线方法，AUROC提升2%到37%，同时保持ICAD的理论假抱错误约束

Conclusion: 提出的方法能够有效检测专业LLM的外域输入，降低关键应用中的风险，为LLM的安全部署提供了新的解决方案

Abstract: We propose a novel inference-time out-of-domain (OOD) detection algorithm for
specialized large language models (LLMs). Despite achieving state-of-the-art
performance on in-domain tasks through fine-tuning, specialized LLMs remain
vulnerable to incorrect or unreliable outputs when presented with OOD inputs,
posing risks in critical applications. Our method leverages the Inductive
Conformal Anomaly Detection (ICAD) framework, using a new non-conformity
measure based on the model's dropout tolerance. Motivated by recent findings on
polysemanticity and redundancy in LLMs, we hypothesize that in-domain inputs
exhibit higher dropout tolerance than OOD inputs. We aggregate dropout
tolerance across multiple layers via a valid ensemble approach, improving
detection while maintaining theoretical false alarm bounds from ICAD.
Experiments with medical-specialized LLMs show that our approach detects OOD
inputs better than baseline methods, with AUROC improvements of $2\%$ to $37\%$
when treating OOD datapoints as positives and in-domain test datapoints as
negatives.

Result: 事实性幻觉在所有模型和任务中比忠实性错误更普遍；阿拉伯语预训练模型Allam幻觉率最低，性能与推理模型相当

Conclusion: 阿拉伯语专用模型在减少幻觉方面优于多语言模型，需要针对阿拉伯语特点开发更有效的幻觉检测和缓解方法

Abstract: Recently, extensive research on the hallucination of the large language
models (LLMs) has mainly focused on the English language. Despite the growing
number of multilingual and Arabic-specific LLMs, evaluating LLMs' hallucination
in the Arabic context remains relatively underexplored. The knowledge gap is
particularly pressing given Arabic's widespread use across many regions and its
importance in global communication and media. This paper presents the first
comprehensive hallucination evaluation of Arabic and multilingual LLMs on two
critical Arabic natural language generation tasks: generative question
answering (GQA) and summarization. This study evaluates a total of 12 LLMs,
including 4 Arabic pre-trained models, 4 multilingual models, and 4
reasoning-based models. To assess the factual consistency and faithfulness of
LLMs' outputs, we developed a fine-grained hallucination evaluation framework
consisting of 12 fine-grained hallucination indicators that represent the
varying characteristics of each task. The results reveal that factual
hallucinations are more prevalent than faithfulness errors across all models
and tasks. Notably, the Arabic pre-trained model Allam consistently
demonstrates lower hallucination rates than multilingual models and a
comparative performance with reasoning-based models. The code is available at:

Abstract: In-Image Machine Translation (IIMT) aims to translate images containing texts
from one language to another. Current research of end-to-end IIMT mainly
conducts on synthetic data, with simple background, single font, fixed text
position, and bilingual translation, which can not fully reflect real world,
causing a significant gap between the research and practical conditions. To
facilitate research of IIMT in real-world scenarios, we explore Practical
In-Image Multilingual Machine Translation (IIMMT). In order to convince the
lack of publicly available data, we annotate the PRIM dataset, which contains
real-world captured one-line text images with complex background, various
fonts, diverse text positions, and supports multilingual translation
directions. We propose an end-to-end model VisTrans to handle the challenge of
practical conditions in PRIM, which processes visual text and background
information in the image separately, ensuring the capability of multilingual
translation while improving the visual quality. Experimental results indicate
the VisTrans achieves a better translation quality and visual effect compared
to other models. The code and dataset are available at:

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一个基于SQL2NL的模式对齐释义框架，用于自动生成语义等价但词汇多样的查询，从而系统评估NL2SQL模型对语言变异的鲁棒性。研究发现当前最先进模型在语言变异方面表现脆弱，性能下降显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试很少系统或受控地处理语言变异因素，无法准确理解NL2SQL模型的泛化能力。需要一种专门评估模型对语言变异鲁棒性的方法。

Method: 使用SQL-to-NL技术自动生成语义等价但词汇多样的查询，同时保持与原始模式和意图的对齐，创建模式对齐的释义框架。

Result: 最先进模型在释义查询上表现脆弱：LLaMa3.3-70B执行准确率下降10.23%，LLaMa3.1-8B下降近20%，小模型受影响更严重。鲁棒性退化程度因查询复杂度、数据集和领域而异。

Conclusion: 需要显式测量语言泛化能力的评估框架，以确保模型在真实世界设置中的可靠性能，当前基准测试严重高估了模型的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Robust evaluation in the presence of linguistic variation is key to
understanding the generalization capabilities of Natural Language to SQL
(NL2SQL) models, yet existing benchmarks rarely address this factor in a
systematic or controlled manner. We propose a novel schema-aligned paraphrasing
framework that leverages SQL-to-NL (SQL2NL) to automatically generate
semantically equivalent, lexically diverse queries while maintaining alignment
with the original schema and intent. This enables the first targeted evaluation
of NL2SQL robustness to linguistic variation in isolation-distinct from prior
work that primarily investigates ambiguity or schema perturbations. Our
analysis reveals that state-of-the-art models are far more brittle than
standard benchmarks suggest. For example, LLaMa3.3-70B exhibits a 10.23% drop
in execution accuracy (from 77.11% to 66.9%) on paraphrased Spider queries,
while LLaMa3.1-8B suffers an even larger drop of nearly 20% (from 62.9% to
42.5%). Smaller models (e.g., GPT-4o mini) are disproportionately affected. We
also find that robustness degradation varies significantly with query
complexity, dataset, and domain -- highlighting the need for evaluation
frameworks that explicitly measure linguistic generalization to ensure reliable
performance in real-world settings.

Motivation: 解决大型语言模型在不确定时猜测而产生错误信息的幻觉问题，这种问题影响了模型的可信过性。

Method: 分析现代训练流程中幻觉的统计根源，讨论评估机制如何奖励猜测而非承认不确定性。

Result: 幻觉问题的根源在于训练和评估体系的偏向，是二元分类错误的统计结果。

Conclusion: 需要通过修改现有偏差评测标准的社会技术方案来减少幻觉，而非继续增加幻觉评估。

Abstract: Like students facing hard exam questions, large language models sometimes
guess when uncertain, producing plausible yet incorrect statements instead of
admitting uncertainty. Such "hallucinations" persist even in state-of-the-art
systems and undermine trust. We argue that language models hallucinate because
the training and evaluation procedures reward guessing over acknowledging
uncertainty, and we analyze the statistical causes of hallucinations in the
modern training pipeline. Hallucinations need not be mysterious -- they
originate simply as errors in binary classification. If incorrect statements
cannot be distinguished from facts, then hallucinations in pretrained language
models will arise through natural statistical pressures. We then argue that
hallucinations persist due to the way most evaluations are graded -- language
models are optimized to be good test-takers, and guessing when uncertain
improves test performance. This "epidemic" of penalizing uncertain responses
can only be addressed through a socio-technical mitigation: modifying the
scoring of existing benchmarks that are misaligned but dominate leaderboards,
rather than introducing additional hallucination evaluations. This change may
steer the field toward more trustworthy AI systems.

Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) are foundational to many AI applications, but
maintaining their freshness and completeness remains costly. We present ODKE+,
a production-grade system that automatically extracts and ingests millions of
open-domain facts from web sources with high precision. ODKE+ combines modular
components into a scalable pipeline: (1) the Extraction Initiator detects
missing or stale facts, (2) the Evidence Retriever collects supporting
documents, (3) hybrid Knowledge Extractors apply both pattern-based rules and
ontology-guided prompting for large language models (LLMs), (4) a lightweight
Grounder validates extracted facts using a second LLM, and (5) the Corroborator
ranks and normalizes candidate facts for ingestion. ODKE+ dynamically generates
ontology snippets tailored to each entity type to align extractions with schema
constraints, enabling scalable, type-consistent fact extraction across 195
predicates. The system supports batch and streaming modes, processing over 9
million Wikipedia pages and ingesting 19 million high-confidence facts with
98.8% precision. ODKE+ significantly improves coverage over traditional
methods, achieving up to 48% overlap with third-party KGs and reducing update
lag by 50 days on average. Our deployment demonstrates that LLM-based
extraction, grounded in ontological structure and verification workflows, can
deliver trustworthiness, production-scale knowledge ingestion with broad
real-world applicability. A recording of the system demonstration is included

Abstract: Natural language processing (NLP) is a key technology to extract important
patient information from clinical narratives to support healthcare
applications. The rapid development of large language models (LLMs) has
revolutionized many NLP tasks in the clinical domain, yet their optimal use in
patient information extraction tasks requires further exploration. This study
examines LLMs' effectiveness in patient information extraction, focusing on LLM
architectures, fine-tuning strategies, and multi-task instruction tuning
techniques for developing robust and generalizable patient information
extraction systems. This study aims to explore key concepts of using LLMs for
clinical concept and relation extraction tasks, including: (1) encoder-only or
decoder-only LLMs, (2) prompt-based parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT)
algorithms, and (3) multi-task instruction tuning on few-shot learning
performance. We benchmarked a suite of LLMs, including encoder-based LLMs
(BERT, GatorTron) and decoder-based LLMs (GatorTronGPT, Llama 3.1,
GatorTronLlama), across five datasets. We compared traditional full-size
fine-tuning and prompt-based PEFT. We explored a multi-task instruction tuning
framework that combines both tasks across four datasets to evaluate the
zero-shot and few-shot learning performance using the leave-one-dataset-out
strategy.

Abstract: Accurately answering complex questions has consistently been a significant
challenge for Large Language Models (LLMs). To address this, this paper
proposes a multi-hop question decomposition method for complex questions,
building upon research within the MQUAKE framework. Utilizing the LLAMA3 model,
we systematically investigate the impact of multi-hop question decomposition
within knowledge graphs on model comprehension and reasoning accuracy, both
before and after model training. In our experiments, we systematically
partitioned and converted the MQUAKE-T dataset into two distinct formats: a
single-hop dataset designed for directly answering complex questions, and a
multi-hop dataset constructed using the multi-hop question decomposition
method. We then fine-tuned the LLAMA3 model on these datasets and conducted
inference tests. Our results demonstrate that, without fine-tuning the LLM, the
prediction performance based on the multi-hop question decomposition method
significantly outperforms the method of directly answering complex questions.
After fine-tuning using the LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) method, the performance
of both approaches improved compared to the untrained baseline. Crucially, the
method utilizing multi-hop decomposition consistently maintained its
superiority. These findings validate the effectiveness of the multi-hop
decomposition method both before and after training, demonstrating its
capability to effectively enhance the LLM's ability to answer complex
questions.

Abstract: From the dawn of the computer, Allen Turing dreamed of a robot that could
communicate using language as a human being. The recent advances in the field
of Large Language Models (LLMs) shocked the scientific community when a single
model can apply for various natural language processing (NLP) tasks, while the
output results are sometimes even better than most human communication skills.
Models such as GPT, Claude, Grok, etc. have left their mark on the scientific
community. However, it is unclear how much these models understand what they
produce, especially in a nuanced theme such as humor. The question of whether
computers understand humor is still open (among the decoders, the latest to be
checked was GPT-2). We addressed this issue in this paper; we have showed that
a fine-tuned decoder (GPT-4o) performed (Mean F1-macro score of 0.85) as well
as the best fine-tuned encoder (RoBERTa with a Mean of F1-score 0.86)

TL;DR: DQO是一种基于行列式点过程的训练方法，通过联合优化语言模型的质量和语义多样性，在保持模型质量的同时显著提升输出响应的语义多样性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的监督微调和强化学习方法虽然能提升模型在下游任务上的性能，但往往会降低输出多样性，导致响应变得狭窄和规范化。现有增强多样性的方法要么在推理时操作，要么只关注词汇差异。

Method: 基于行列式点过程(DPPs)，为每个提示采样并嵌入一组响应，然后使用基于核的相似性矩阵的行列式来测量这些响应嵌入所跨越的体积，从而衡量语义多样性。

Result: 在指令跟随、摘要、故事生成和推理任务上的实验表明，该方法在不牺牲模型质量的情况下显著提高了语义多样性。

Conclusion: DQO方法有效解决了LLM后训练中多样性降低的问题，通过联合优化质量和语义多样性，为语言模型训练提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning are two popular methods for
post-training large language models (LLMs). While improving the model's
performance on downstream tasks, they often reduce the model's output
diversity, leading to narrow, canonical responses. Existing methods to enhance
diversity are limited, either by operating at inference time or by focusing on
lexical differences. We propose a novel training method named DQO based on
determinantal point processes (DPPs) to jointly optimize LLMs for quality and
semantic diversity. Our approach samples and embeds a group of responses for
each prompt, then uses the determinant of a kernel-based similarity matrix to
measure diversity as the volume spanned by the embeddings of these responses.
Experiments across instruction-following, summarization, story generation, and
reasoning tasks demonstrate that our method substantially improves semantic
diversity without sacrificing model quality.

TL;DR: 这篇论文系统研究了大语言模型中人格操控的机制和权衡，比较了三种方法：上下文学习、参数高效微调和机制导向，提出了统一评估框架和稳定性分析，并展示了不同方法在对齐效果、任务性能和运行效率方面的特性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在客服和自主代理场景中应用日益增多，人格操控成为重要需求，但其机制和权衡仍不明确，需要系统性研究来理解不同方法的效果和影响。

Method: 采用Big Five人格特质框架，构建对比性数据集，比较三种方法：上下文学习(ICL)、参数高效微调(PEFT)和机制导向(MS)。提出统一评估框架、特质粹洁技术和三级稳定性分析框架。在Gemma-2-2B-IT和LLaMA-3-8B-Instruct模型上进行实验。

Result: 不同方法展现明显权衡：ICL实现强对齐且能力损失最小，PEFT对齐效果最好但任务性能下降，MS提供轻量运行控制且效果竞争力强。开放性是最具挑战性的特质，和谬性对ICL最耐受，人格编码集中在中间层。

Conclusion: 研究将人格操控定位为多级别行为表征探针，连接了表面条件化、参数编码和激活层级导向。机制导向方法作为轻量替代方案，在部署和可解释性方面都具有优势。

Abstract: Personality manipulation in large language models (LLMs) is increasingly
applied in customer service and agentic scenarios, yet its mechanisms and
trade-offs remain unclear. We present a systematic study of personality control
using the Big Five traits, comparing in-context learning (ICL),
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), and mechanistic steering (MS). Our
contributions are fourfold. First, we construct a contrastive dataset with
balanced high/low trait responses, enabling effective steering vector
computation and fair cross-method evaluation. Second, we introduce a unified
evaluation framework based on within-run $\Delta$ analysis that disentangles,
reasoning capability, agent performance, and demographic bias across MMLU,
GAIA, and BBQ benchmarks. Third, we develop trait purification techniques to
separate openness from conscientiousness, addressing representational overlap
in trait encoding. Fourth, we propose a three-level stability framework that
quantifies method-, trait-, and combination-level robustness, offering
practical guidance under deployment constraints. Experiments on Gemma-2-2B-IT
and LLaMA-3-8B-Instruct reveal clear trade-offs: ICL achieves strong alignment
with minimal capability loss, PEFT delivers the highest alignment at the cost
of degraded task performance, and MS provides lightweight runtime control with
competitive effectiveness. Trait-level analysis shows openness as uniquely
challenging, agreeableness as most resistant to ICL, and personality encoding
consolidating around intermediate layers. Taken together, these results
establish personality manipulation as a multi-level probe into behavioral
representation, linking surface conditioning, parameter encoding, and
activation-level steering, and positioning mechanistic steering as a
lightweight alternative to fine-tuning for both deployment and
interpretability.

TL;DR: 论文研究了语言模型在递归合成数据训练中出现的知识崩溃现象，提出了基于指令格式的崩溃轨迹分析方法，并提出了领域特定合成训练的缓解策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于人类编写内容稀缺，大语言模型越来越依赖合成数据，但递归训练模型生成的输出会导致模型崩溃，威胁事实可靠性。

Method: 通过控制实验进行递归合成训练，分析指令格式对崩溃轨迹的影响，提出领域特定合成训练作为缓解策略，并开发结合模型中心指标和任务中心指标的评估框架。

Result: 研究发现崩溃轨迹和时间严重依赖于指令格式，区分了指令跟随崩溃与传统模型崩溃，领域特定合成训练在保持计算效率的同时显著提高了抗崩溃能力。

Conclusion: 研究结果为理解崩溃动态提供了理论见解，并为知识密集型应用中可持续AI训练提供了实用指导，特别是在准确性至关重要的领域。

Abstract: Large language models increasingly rely on synthetic data due to
human-written content scarcity, yet recursive training on model-generated
outputs leads to model collapse, a degenerative process threatening factual
reliability. We define knowledge collapse as a distinct three-stage phenomenon
where factual accuracy deteriorates while surface fluency persists, creating
"confidently wrong" outputs that pose critical risks in accuracy-dependent
domains. Through controlled experiments with recursive synthetic training, we
demonstrate that collapse trajectory and timing depend critically on
instruction format, distinguishing instruction-following collapse from
traditional model collapse through its conditional, prompt-dependent nature. We
propose domain-specific synthetic training as a targeted mitigation strategy
that achieves substantial improvements in collapse resistance while maintaining
computational efficiency. Our evaluation framework combines model-centric
indicators with task-centric metrics to detect distinct degradation phases,
enabling reproducible assessment of epistemic deterioration across different
language models. These findings provide both theoretical insights into collapse
dynamics and practical guidance for sustainable AI training in
knowledge-intensive applications where accuracy is paramount.

TL;DR: AgentSeer是一个基于可观测性的评估框架，用于系统评估AI代理在部署环境中的安全风险，揭示了模型级评估与代理级评估之间的关键差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型向代理系统过渡，当前的安全评估框架在评估部署特定风险方面存在关键差距，需要新的评估范式来识别代理特有的安全漏洞。

Method: 引入AgentSeer框架，将代理执行分解为细粒度的动作和组件图，通过GPT-OSS-20B和Gemini-2.0-flash模型的跨模型验证，使用HarmBench单轮和迭代精化攻击进行评估。

Result: 发现模型级评估显示基线差异（GPT-OSS-20B:39.47% ASR vs Gemini-2.0-flash:50.00% ASR），而代理级评估暴露了传统评估不可见的代理特有风险，工具调用攻击成功率高出24-60%。

Conclusion: 研究确认了系统性的评估差距，确立了紧急需要代理情境评估范式的必要性，AgentSeer提供了标准化方法和实证验证。

Abstract: As large language models transition to agentic systems, current safety
evaluation frameworks face critical gaps in assessing deployment-specific
risks. We introduce AgentSeer, an observability-based evaluation framework that
decomposes agentic executions into granular action and component graphs,
enabling systematic agentic-situational assessment. Through cross-model
validation on GPT-OSS-20B and Gemini-2.0-flash using HarmBench single turn and
iterative refinement attacks, we demonstrate fundamental differences between
model-level and agentic-level vulnerability profiles. Model-level evaluation
reveals baseline differences: GPT-OSS-20B (39.47% ASR) versus Gemini-2.0-flash
(50.00% ASR), with both models showing susceptibility to social engineering
while maintaining logic-based attack resistance. However, agentic-level
assessment exposes agent-specific risks invisible to traditional evaluation. We
discover "agentic-only" vulnerabilities that emerge exclusively in agentic
contexts, with tool-calling showing 24-60% higher ASR across both models.
Cross-model analysis reveals universal agentic patterns, agent transfer
operations as highest-risk tools, semantic rather than syntactic vulnerability
mechanisms, and context-dependent attack effectiveness, alongside
model-specific security profiles in absolute ASR levels and optimal injection
strategies. Direct attack transfer from model-level to agentic contexts shows
degraded performance (GPT-OSS-20B: 57% human injection ASR; Gemini-2.0-flash:
28%), while context-aware iterative attacks successfully compromise objectives
that failed at model-level, confirming systematic evaluation gaps. These
findings establish the urgent need for agentic-situation evaluation paradigms,
with AgentSeer providing the standardized methodology and empirical validation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究探讨判别式词典模型(DLM)能否在不设置屈折类别的情况下理解和生成芬兰语屈折名词，结果显示模型在训练数据上表现优异，测试数据上准确率下降但仍可接受，频率是模型性能的主要预测因素。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究屈折类别是否具有认知现实性，即母语者是否需要发现这些类别才能正确屈折名词，探索DLM模型是否可以在不设置屈折类别的情况下学习芬兰语名词屈折系统。

Method: 使用包含55,271个屈折名词的数据集(来自49个屈折类别的2000个高频芬兰语名词)，建立多个DLM理解和生成模型，包括不考虑使用频率的无限暴露学习模型和考虑词频的使用频率模型。

Result: 模型在训练数据上准确率很高，测试数据上准确率下降但仍可接受。模型对类型更多、低频词更多、罕用词更多的屈折类别表现更好，反映了这些类别的能产性。使用频率模型的表现主要受频率因素主导。

Conclusion: DLM可以在不设置屈折类别的情况下学习芬兰语名词屈折系统，频率是模型性能的关键预测因素，对于能产性较低的类别，模型在处理新形式时表现较差。

Abstract: Descriptions of complex nominal or verbal systems make use of inflectional
classes. Inflectional classes bring together nouns which have similar stem
changes and use similar exponents in their paradigms. Although inflectional
classes can be very useful for language teaching as well as for setting up
finite state morphological systems, it is unclear whether inflectional classes
are cognitively real, in the sense that native speakers would need to discover
these classes in order to learn how to properly inflect the nouns of their
language. This study investigates whether the Discriminative Lexicon Model
(DLM) can understand and produce Finnish inflected nouns without setting up
inflectional classes, using a dataset with 55,271 inflected nouns of 2000
high-frequency Finnish nouns from 49 inflectional classes. Several DLM
comprehension and production models were set up. Some models were not informed
about frequency of use, and provide insight into learnability with infinite
exposure (endstate learning). Other models were set up from a usage based
perspective, and were trained with token frequencies being taken into
consideration (frequency-informed learning). On training data, models performed
with very high accuracies. For held-out test data, accuracies decreased, as
expected, but remained acceptable. Across most models, performance increased
for inflectional classes with more types, more lower-frequency words, and more
hapax legomena, mirroring the productivity of the inflectional classes. The
model struggles more with novel forms of unproductive and less productive
classes, and performs far better for unseen forms belonging to productive
classes. However, for usage-based production models, frequency was the dominant
predictor of model performance, and correlations with measures of productivity
were tenuous or absent.

Motivation: 解决语音语义理解(SLU)系统开发中标签训练数据稀缺和大语言模型部署计算负担较高的挑战。

Method: 提出适应性特征蓄粉框架(AFD-SLU)，使用残差投影神经网络(RPNN)的动态适配器对齐异构特征空间，通过动态蓄粉系数(DDC)根据意图和槽位预测性能进行调节。

Result: 在中文ProSLU标准数据集上达到最高水平：意图准确率95.67%、槽位F1得92.02%、总体准确率85.50%。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效地将大模型的丰富语义表征转移到轻量模型，在保持高性能的同时降低计算成本。

Abstract: Spoken Language Understanding (SLU) is a core component of conversational
systems, enabling machines to interpret user utterances. Despite its
importance, developing effective SLU systems remains challenging due to the
scarcity of labeled training data and the computational burden of deploying
Large Language Models (LLMs) in real-world applications. To further alleviate
these issues, we propose an Adaptive Feature Distillation framework that
transfers rich semantic representations from a General Text Embeddings
(GTE)-based teacher model to a lightweight student model. Our method introduces
a dynamic adapter equipped with a Residual Projection Neural Network (RPNN) to
align heterogeneous feature spaces, and a Dynamic Distillation Coefficient
(DDC) that adaptively modulates the distillation strength based on real-time
feedback from intent and slot prediction performance. Experiments on the
Chinese profile-based ProSLU benchmark demonstrate that AFD-SLU achieves
state-of-the-art results, with 95.67% intent accuracy, 92.02% slot F1 score,
and 85.50% overall accuracy.

Motivation: 探究大语言模型的泛化能力是来自训练数据的简单记忆还是真正的语义理解，评估其情景认知能力。

Method: 构建基于情景的数据集，包含虚构事实的文本描述和情景元素标注，通过模型输出和内部表示两个视角评估LLM的情景元素-论元关联能力。

Result: 实验显示当前LLM主要依赖表层记忆，即使在简单情况下也无法实现稳健的语义情景认知。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LLM在语义理解方面的关键局限性，为提升其认知能力提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Driven by vast and diverse textual data, large language models (LLMs) have
demonstrated impressive performance across numerous natural language processing
(NLP) tasks. Yet, a critical question persists: does their generalization arise
from mere memorization of training data or from deep semantic understanding? To
investigate this, we propose a bi-perspective evaluation framework to assess
LLMs' scenario cognition - the ability to link semantic scenario elements with
their arguments in context. Specifically, we introduce a novel scenario-based
dataset comprising diverse textual descriptions of fictional facts, annotated
with scenario elements. LLMs are evaluated through their capacity to answer
scenario-related questions (model output perspective) and via probing their
internal representations for encoded scenario elements-argument associations
(internal representation perspective). Our experiments reveal that current LLMs
predominantly rely on superficial memorization, failing to achieve robust
semantic scenario cognition, even in simple cases. These findings expose
critical limitations in LLMs' semantic understanding and offer cognitive
insights for advancing their capabilities.

Motivation: 自动化ICD-10编码可以简化医疗专业人员工作，确保医院编码的一致性，提高疗程统计和保险申报的效率

Method: 多阶段流水线方法：先使用临床词典匹配明确术语，然后对未匹配项使用GPT-4.1进行上下文学习预测ICD-10编码

Result: 在多语言数据集上获得了迈的成果：西班牙语CodiEsp数据集上类别F1得分0.89，子类别F1得分0.78；希腊语ElCardioCC数据集上F1得分0.85

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效地实现临床术语到ICD-10编码的自动标注，在不同语言环境下都发挥良好性能，为医疗信息自动化处理提供了可靠的解决方案

Abstract: The linking of clinical entities is a crucial part of extracting structured
information from clinical texts. It is the process of assigning a code from a
medical ontology or classification to a phrase in the text. The International
Classification of Diseases - 10th revision (ICD-10) is an international
standard for classifying diseases for statistical and insurance purposes.
Automatically assigning the correct ICD-10 code to terms in discharge summaries
will simplify the work of healthcare professionals and ensure consistent coding
in hospitals. Our paper proposes an approach for linking clinical terms to
ICD-10 codes in different languages using Large Language Models (LLMs). The
approach consists of a multistage pipeline that uses clinical dictionaries to
match unambiguous terms in the text and then applies in-context learning with
GPT-4.1 to predict the ICD-10 code for the terms that do not match the
dictionary. Our system shows promising results in predicting ICD-10 codes on
different benchmark datasets in Spanish - 0.89 F1 for categories and 0.78 F1 on
subcategories on CodiEsp, and Greek - 0.85 F1 on ElCardioCC.

Abstract: In this report, we introduce PLaMo 2, a series of Japanese-focused large

full attention via continual pre-training to support 32K token contexts.
Training leverages extensive synthetic corpora to overcome data scarcity, while
computational efficiency is achieved through weight reuse and structured
pruning. This efficient pruning methodology produces an 8B model that achieves
performance comparable to our previous 100B model. Post-training further
refines the models using a pipeline of supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and direct
preference optimization (DPO), enhanced by synthetic Japanese instruction data
and model merging techniques. Optimized for inference using vLLM and
quantization with minimal accuracy loss, the PLaMo 2 models achieve
state-of-the-art results on Japanese benchmarks, outperforming similarly-sized
open models in instruction-following, language fluency, and Japanese-specific

Motivation: 解决大语言模型微调时的高计算需求问题，特别是在资源受限的情况下，需要更高效的适配方法。

Method: 使用L1正则化修剪冗余秩并重新分配跨适配器，给定秩预算约束下优化资源利用。

Result: L1RA在保持或减少计算开销的同时，达到与其他LoRA变体相当或更好的性能，并发现前馈层和注意力输出投影层需要最多适配。

Conclusion: L1RA是提升LLM适配性能和可解释性的有前景技术，特别适用于计算资源受限的场景。

Abstract: The ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to solve complex tasks has made
them crucial in the development of AI-based applications. However, the high
computational requirements to fine-tune these LLMs on downstream tasks pose
significant challenges, particularly when resources are limited. In response to
this challenge, we introduce L1RA, a novel technique aimed at dynamically
distributing the rank of low-rank adapters during fine-tuning using LoRA. Given
a rank budget (i.e., total sum of adapters rank), L1RA leverages L1
regularisation to prune redundant ranks and redistribute them across adapters,
thereby optimising resource utilisation. Through a series of comprehensive
experiments, we empirically demonstrate that L1RA maintains comparable or even
reduced computational overhead compared to other LoRA variants, including the
vanilla approach, while achieving same or better performances. Moreover, the
post-training analysis of rank distribution unveiled insights into the specific
model components requiring the most adaptation to align with the task
objective: the feed-forward layers and the attention output projection. These
results highlight the efficacy of L1RA in not only enhancing the efficiency of
LLM fine-tuning, but also in providing valuable diagnostic information for
model refinement and customisation. In conclusion, L1RA stands as a promising
technique for advancing the performance and interpretability of LLM adaptation,
particularly in scenarios where computational resources are constrained.

Conclusion: 该流水线提供了一种可行方案，能够在保护数据隐私的同时充分利用限制计算资源对医疗分流数据进行分析

Abstract: Triage notes, created at the start of a patient's hospital visit, contain a
wealth of information that can help medical staff and researchers understand
Emergency Department patient epidemiology and the degree of time-dependent
illness or injury. Unfortunately, applying modern Natural Language Processing
and Machine Learning techniques to analyse triage data faces some challenges:
Firstly, hospital data contains highly sensitive information that is subject to
privacy regulation thus need to be analysed on site; Secondly, most hospitals
and medical facilities lack the necessary hardware to fine-tune a Large
Language Model (LLM), much less training one from scratch; Lastly, to identify
the records of interest, expert inputs are needed to manually label the
datasets, which can be time-consuming and costly. We present in this paper a
pipeline that enables the classification of triage data using LLM and limited
compute resources. We first fine-tuned a pre-trained LLM with a classifier
using a small (2k) open sourced dataset on a GPU; and then further fine-tuned
the model with a hospital specific dataset of 1000 samples on a CPU. We
demonstrated that by carefully curating the datasets and leveraging existing
models and open sourced data, we can successfully classify triage data with
limited compute resources.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ACE-RL框架通过自适应约束增强的强化学习方法，解决了LLM在长文本生成中依赖稀缺高质量数据和粗粒度优化的问题，显著提升了生成质量并超越了GPT-4o等专有系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要存在两个局限：(1)过度依赖稀缺的高质量长文本响应数据进行监督微调或成对偏好奖励；(2)只关注粗粒度的质量优化维度，忽略了不同长文本生成场景的细粒度特性。

Method: 提出ACE-RL框架：首先自动将指令解构为细粒度的自适应约束标准，然后设计基于约束满足度的奖励机制，将主观质量评估转化为约束验证，最后使用强化学习指导模型生成高质量长文本。

Result: 在WritingBench上分别超越现有SFT和RL基线20.70%和7.32%，最佳模型甚至超越GPT-4o达7.10%。

Conclusion: ACE-RL为LLM在不同长文本生成场景中生成高质量内容提供了更有效的训练范式。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable progress in
long-context understanding, yet they face significant challenges in
high-quality long-form generation. Existing studies primarily suffer from two
limitations: (1) A heavy reliance on scarce, high-quality long-form response
data for supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or for pairwise preference reward in
reinforcement learning (RL). (2) Focus on coarse-grained quality optimization
dimensions, such as relevance, coherence, and helpfulness, overlooking the
fine-grained specifics inherent to diverse long-form generation scenarios. To
address this issue, we propose a framework using Adaptive Constraint-Enhanced
reward for long-form generation Reinforcement Learning (ACE-RL). ACE-RL first
automatically deconstructs each instruction into a set of fine-grained,
adaptive constraint criteria by identifying its underlying intents and demands.
Subsequently, we design a reward mechanism that quantifies the quality of
long-form responses based on their satisfaction over corresponding constraints,
converting subjective quality evaluation into constraint verification. Finally,
we utilize reinforcement learning to guide models toward superior long-form
generation capabilities. Experimental results demonstrate that our ACE-RL
framework significantly outperforms existing SFT and RL baselines by 20.70% and
7.32% on WritingBench, and our top-performing model even surpasses proprietary
systems like GPT-4o by 7.10%, providing a more effective training paradigm for
LLMs to generate high-quality content across diverse long-form generation
scenarios.

Abstract: In the era of conversational AI, generating accurate and contextually
appropriate service responses remains a critical challenge. A central question
remains: Is explicit intent recognition a prerequisite for generating
high-quality service responses, or can models bypass this step and produce
effective replies directly? This paper conducts a rigorous comparative study to
address this fundamental design dilemma. Leveraging two publicly available
service interaction datasets, we benchmark several state-of-the-art language
models, including a fine-tuned T5 variant, across both paradigms: Intent-First
Response Generation and Direct Response Generation. Evaluation metrics
encompass both linguistic quality and task success rates, revealing surprising
insights into the necessity or redundancy of explicit intent modelling. Our
findings challenge conventional assumptions in conversational AI pipelines,
offering actionable guidelines for designing more efficient and effective

Motivation: 在数据受限的语言学习场景中，探索扩散模型作为传统自回归和掩码语言建模的替代方案，提高数据利用效率

Method: 使用扩散训练目标进行语言建模，采用频率感知掩码策略优先学习稀有词元，研究多种噪声调度策略（包括双模式方法）和噪声加权方案

Result: 在BabyLM基准测试套件上评估，在语言能力、世界知识和人类相似性方面表现与混合自回归-掩码基线方法竞争力相当

Conclusion: 基于扩散的训练方法为数据受限的语言学习提供了可行的替代方案，证明了其在严格数据约束下的有效性

Abstract: We present a masked diffusion language modeling framework for data-efficient
training for the BabyLM 2025 Challenge. Our approach applies diffusion training
objectives to language modeling under strict data constraints, incorporating
frequency-informed masking that prioritizes learning from rare tokens while
maintaining theoretical validity. We explore multiple noise scheduling
strategies, including two-mode approaches, and investigate different noise
weighting schemes within the NELBO objective. We evaluate our method on the
BabyLM benchmark suite, measuring linguistic competence, world knowledge, and
human-likeness. Results show performance competitive to hybrid
autoregressive-masked baselines, demonstrating that diffusion-based training
offers a viable alternative for data-restricted language learning.

TL;DR: Entropy2Vec是一个利用单语语言模型熵来生成跨语言表示的新框架，通过模型预测的不确定性来捕捉语言间的类型学关系，避免了传统类型学清单的特征稀疏问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统类型学清单存在特征稀疏和静态快照的问题，需要一种能够捕捉语言间动态类型学关系的新方法。

Method: 通过训练单语语言模型，利用其预测熵来反映语言间的结构相似性：低熵表示高相似性，高熵表示较大差异，从而生成密集、非稀疏的语言嵌入。

Result: 实证评估显示Entropy2Vec嵌入与既定类型学类别一致，在多语言NLP任务中达到竞争性性能。

Conclusion: Entropy2Vec提供了一种有效的方法来捕捉语言间的类型学关系，生成适应性强、无缺失值的语言嵌入，在跨语言NLP任务中表现良好。

Abstract: We introduce Entropy2Vec, a novel framework for deriving cross-lingual
language representations by leveraging the entropy of monolingual language
models. Unlike traditional typological inventories that suffer from feature
sparsity and static snapshots, Entropy2Vec uses the inherent uncertainty in
language models to capture typological relationships between languages. By
training a language model on a single language, we hypothesize that the entropy
of its predictions reflects its structural similarity to other languages: Low
entropy indicates high similarity, while high entropy suggests greater
divergence. This approach yields dense, non-sparse language embeddings that are
adaptable to different timeframes and free from missing values. Empirical
evaluations demonstrate that Entropy2Vec embeddings align with established
typological categories and achieved competitive performance in downstream
multilingual NLP tasks, such as those addressed by the LinguAlchemy framework.

TL;DR: 提出了ToM-SSI新基准测试，用于评估基础模型在复杂社交互动和空间动态环境中的心理理论能力，突破了传统Sally-Anne测试的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有心理理论基准测试主要基于Sally-Anne测试变体，视角有限且忽略了人类社交互动的复杂性，需要更全面的评估框架。

Method: 开发了多模态的ToM-SSI基准测试，包含最多4个智能体的群体互动，支持沟通和空间移动，能够研究混合合作-阻碍场景和多智能体并行心理状态推理。

Result: 评估显示当前模型在这些新任务上的表现仍然严重受限，特别是在复杂社交互动场景中。

Conclusion: ToM-SSI基准测试揭示了现有模型在复杂心理理论任务上的关键差距，为未来研究指明了方向。

Abstract: Most existing Theory of Mind (ToM) benchmarks for foundation models rely on
variations of the Sally-Anne test, offering only a very limited perspective on
ToM and neglecting the complexity of human social interactions. To address this
gap, we propose ToM-SSI: a new benchmark specifically designed to test ToM
capabilities in environments rich with social interactions and spatial
dynamics. While current ToM benchmarks are limited to text-only or dyadic
interactions, ToM-SSI is multimodal and includes group interactions of up to
four agents that communicate and move in situated environments. This unique
design allows us to study, for the first time, mixed cooperative-obstructive
settings and reasoning about multiple agents' mental state in parallel, thus
capturing a wider range of social cognition than existing benchmarks. Our
evaluations reveal that the current models' performance is still severely
limited, especially in these new tasks, highlighting critical gaps for future
research.

TL;DR: 时间序列分析基础模型评测标准化研究，通过统一三个自然语言描述任务来评估13个先进模型的能力，发现时间序列特定架构和视觉模型表现优异，但所有模型在稳健性测试中都存在漏洞。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前时间序列基础模型评估中存在的问题：新模型与新数据集同时提出导致无法直接比较，以及广泛的多任务评估无法准确找出模型的具体优势。

Method: 形式化了3个用于测试模型使用通用自然语言描述时间序列能力的任务：识别（真假问答）、区分（多选题）和生成（开放式描述），并统一4个最近的数据集进行头对头模型比较。

Result: 评估13个先进模型发现：(1)普遍语言模型表现较差，需要时间序列特定架构；(2)视觉-语言模型表现良好；(3)预训练多模态时间序列-语言模型超过了大语言模型，但仍有显著提升空间；(4)所有方法在稳健性测试中都存在脆弱性。

Conclusion: 该标准化评测框架为时间序列推理系统提供了必要的任务评估，显示了当前模型的优势与不足，为未来研究指明了方向。

Abstract: Many recent studies have proposed general-purpose foundation models designed
for a variety of time series analysis tasks. While several established datasets
already exist for evaluating these models, previous works frequently introduce
their models in conjunction with new datasets, limiting opportunities for
direct, independent comparisons and obscuring insights into the relative
strengths of different methods. Additionally, prior evaluations often cover
numerous tasks simultaneously, assessing a broad range of model abilities
without clearly pinpointing which capabilities contribute to overall
performance. To address these gaps, we formalize and evaluate 3 tasks that test
a model's ability to describe time series using generic natural language: (1)
recognition (True/False question-answering), (2) differentiation (multiple
choice question-answering), and (3) generation (open-ended natural language
description). We then unify 4 recent datasets to enable head-to-head model
comparisons on each task. Experimentally, in evaluating 13 state-of-the-art
language, vision--language, and time series--language models, we find that (1)
popular language-only methods largely underperform, indicating a need for time
series-specific architectures, (2) VLMs are quite successful, as expected,
identifying the value of vision models for these tasks and (3) pretrained
multimodal time series--language models successfully outperform LLMs, but still
have significant room for improvement. We also find that all approaches exhibit
clear fragility in a range of robustness tests. Overall, our benchmark provides
a standardized evaluation on a task necessary for time series reasoning
systems.

TL;DR: 提出ICR框架，通过迭代澄清和重写解决对话查询重写中多模糊表达的问题，在多个数据集上达到SOTA性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统端到端重写方法在处理查询中多个模糊表达时存在困难，无法同时识别和重写多个位置

Method: ICR框架采用迭代重写方案，基于澄清问题交替生成澄清问题和重写查询

Result: 实验结果显示ICR在澄清-重写迭代过程中持续提升检索性能

Conclusion: ICR框架有效解决了多模糊表达问题，在两个流行数据集上实现了最先进的性能

Abstract: Most previous work on Conversational Query Rewriting employs an end-to-end
rewriting paradigm. However, this approach is hindered by the issue of multiple
fuzzy expressions within the query, which complicates the simultaneous
identification and rewriting of multiple positions. To address this issue, we
propose a novel framework ICR (Iterative Clarification and Rewriting), an
iterative rewriting scheme that pivots on clarification questions. Within this
framework, the model alternates between generating clarification questions and
rewritten queries. The experimental results show that our ICR can continuously
improve retrieval performance in the clarification-rewriting iterative process,
thereby achieving state-of-the-art performance on two popular datasets.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CURE是一个轻量级框架，通过内容提取器和反转网络分离概念无关表示，使用对比学习调整概念线索影响，有效抑制概念驱动的伪相关性，在IMDB和Yelp数据集上显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练语言模型虽然成功但容易受到虚假概念相关性的影响，损害鲁棒性和公平性，需要一种方法来系统性地解耦和抑制概念捷径。

Method: 使用内容提取器和反转网络提取概念无关表示，然后通过可控去偏模块采用对比学习精细调整剩余概念线索的影响。

Result: 在IMDB和Yelp数据集上，使用三种预训练架构，CURE在IMDB上F1分数绝对提升10个百分点，Yelp上提升2个百分点，计算开销最小。

Conclusion: CURE为对抗概念偏见提供了一个灵活的无监督蓝图，为更可靠和公平的语言理解系统铺平了道路。

Abstract: Pre-trained language models have achieved remarkable success across diverse
applications but remain susceptible to spurious, concept-driven correlations
that impair robustness and fairness. In this work, we introduce CURE, a novel
and lightweight framework that systematically disentangles and suppresses
conceptual shortcuts while preserving essential content information. Our method
first extracts concept-irrelevant representations via a dedicated content
extractor reinforced by a reversal network, ensuring minimal loss of
task-relevant information. A subsequent controllable debiasing module employs
contrastive learning to finely adjust the influence of residual conceptual
cues, enabling the model to either diminish harmful biases or harness
beneficial correlations as appropriate for the target task. Evaluated on the
IMDB and Yelp datasets using three pre-trained architectures, CURE achieves an
absolute improvement of +10 points in F1 score on IMDB and +2 points on Yelp,
while introducing minimal computational overhead. Our approach establishes a
flexible, unsupervised blueprint for combating conceptual biases, paving the
way for more reliable and fair language understanding systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统可解释性方法无法捕捉代理式LLMs的推理路径、规划逻辑和系统性影响，在高风险领域中缺乏透明度和可信度。

Method: 提出TAXAL三元融合框架，整合认知维度（用户理解）、功能维度（实用效用）和因果维度（忠实推理），提供统一的角色敏感解释设计基础。

Result: 通过法律、教育、医疗和公共服务等案例研究，展示了TAXAL框架在不同制度约束和利益相关者角色下的适应性。

Conclusion: TAXAL将概念清晰性与设计模式和部署路径相结合，推进了可解释性作为技术和社会技术实践的发展，支持可信赖和情境敏感的LLM应用。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being deployed in high-risk
domains where opacity, bias, and instability undermine trust and
accountability. Traditional explainability methods, focused on surface outputs,
do not capture the reasoning pathways, planning logic, and systemic impacts of
agentic LLMs.
  We introduce TAXAL (Triadic Alignment for eXplainability in Agentic LLMs), a
triadic fusion framework that unites three complementary dimensions: cognitive
(user understanding), functional (practical utility), and causal (faithful
reasoning). TAXAL provides a unified, role-sensitive foundation for designing,
evaluating, and deploying explanations in diverse sociotechnical settings.
  Our analysis synthesizes existing methods, ranging from post-hoc attribution
and dialogic interfaces to explanation-aware prompting, and situates them
within the TAXAL triadic fusion model. We further demonstrate its applicability
through case studies in law, education, healthcare, and public services,
showing how explanation strategies adapt to institutional constraints and
stakeholder roles.
  By combining conceptual clarity with design patterns and deployment pathways,
TAXAL advances explainability as a technical and sociotechnical practice,
supporting trustworthy and context-sensitive LLM applications in the era of
agentic AI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的性能测试方法无法反映语言模型如何在预训练中获得具体的语言概念和能力，需要更细粒度地分析表征学习过程

Method: 使甧稀疏交叉编码器在不同检查点之间发现和对齐特征，并提出新的RelIE指标来追踪特征在任务性能中的因果重要性

Result: 交叉编码器能够检测到特征在预训练过程中的出现、维持和停止现象

Conclusion: 该方法不依赖特定网络结构且可扩展，为预训练过程中的表征学习提供了更可解释和细粒度的分析途径

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) learn non-trivial abstractions during
pretraining, like detecting irregular plural noun subjects. However, it is not
well understood when and how specific linguistic abilities emerge as
traditional evaluation methods such as benchmarking fail to reveal how models
acquire concepts and capabilities. To bridge this gap and better understand
model training at the concept level, we use sparse crosscoders to discover and
align features across model checkpoints. Using this approach, we track the
evolution of linguistic features during pretraining. We train crosscoders
between open-sourced checkpoint triplets with significant performance and
representation shifts, and introduce a novel metric, Relative Indirect Effects
(RelIE), to trace training stages at which individual features become causally
important for task performance. We show that crosscoders can detect feature
emergence, maintenance, and discontinuation during pretraining. Our approach is
architecture-agnostic and scalable, offering a promising path toward more
interpretable and fine-grained analysis of representation learning throughout
pretraining.

TL;DR: Hunyuan-MT-7B是首个开源的33语言多语言翻译模型，特别关注中文与少数民族语言/方言的翻译。Hunyuan-MT-Chimera-7B通过整合多个参数设置下的输出，性能优于传统CoT慢思考模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发支持多语言特别是中文与少数民族语言/方言翻译的高性能模型，解决多样化翻译场景需求。

Method: 采用整体训练流程：通用和MT导向的预训练→监督微调→强化学习和弱到强RL对齐。Chimera模型整合多个参数设置下的输出。

Result: 在同等参数规模的翻译专用模型中表现最佳，在WMT2025共享任务中31个语言对中30个排名第一，涵盖高资源和低资源语言。

Conclusion: 提出的多语言翻译模型在性能上显著优于同类模型，特别是在中文与少数民族语言/方言翻译方面表现出色，证明了模型的鲁棒性和有效性。

Abstract: In this report, we introduce Hunyuan-MT-7B, our first open-source
multilingual translation model, which supports bidirectional translation across
33 major languages and places a special emphasis on translation between
Mandarin and several ethnic minority languages as well as dialects.
Furthermore, to serve and address diverse translation scenarios and enhance
model performance at test time, we introduce Hunyuan-MT-Chimera-7B, a
translation model inspired by the slow thinking mode. This model integrates
multiple outputs generated by the Hunyuan-MT-7B model under varying parameter
settings, thereby achieving performance superior to that of conventional
slow-thinking models based on Chain-of-Thought (CoT). The development of our
models follows a holistic training process specifically engineered for
multilingual translation, which begins with general and MT-oriented
pre-training to build foundational capabilities, proceeds to Supervised
Fine-Tuning (SFT) for task-specific adaptation, and culminates in advanced
alignment through Reinforcement Learning (RL) and weak-to-strong RL. Through
comprehensive experimentation, we demonstrate that both Hunyuan-MT-7B and
Hunyuan-MT-Chimera-7B significantly outperform all translation-specific models
of comparable parameter size and most of the SOTA large models, particularly on
the task of translation between Mandarin and minority languages as well as
dialects. In the WMT2025 shared task (General Machine Translation), our models
demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, ranking first in 30 out of 31
language pairs. This result highlights the robustness of our models across a
diverse linguistic spectrum, encompassing high-resource languages such as
Chinese, English, and Japanese, as well as low-resource languages including
Czech, Marathi, Estonian, and Icelandic.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: HoPE是一种基于双曲几何的新型位置编码方法，通过洛伦兹旋转解决RoPE的振荡问题，在长序列建模中表现优异


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有位置编码方法（绝对编码、Alibi、RoPE）在超长序列建模中存在外推困难、性能下降和注意力模式振荡等问题，需要更好的解决方案

Method: 从双曲几何中的洛伦兹变换获得灵感，提出双曲旋转位置编码(HoPE)，使用双曲函数对token表示进行洛伦兹旋转，确保注意力权重随token距离单调衰减

Result: 理论分析表明RoPE是HoPE的特例，实验证明HoPE在多个扩展序列基准测试中持续超越现有位置编码方法，困惑度评估表现优异

Conclusion: HoPE通过几何重构从根本上解决了长距离依赖建模问题，增强了长序列表示和泛化能力，是位置编码的重要进展

Abstract: Positional encoding mechanisms enable Transformers to model sequential
structure and long-range dependencies in text. While absolute positional
encodings struggle with extrapolation to longer sequences due to fixed
positional representations, and relative approaches like Alibi exhibit
performance degradation on extremely long contexts, the widely-used Rotary
Positional Encoding (RoPE) introduces oscillatory attention patterns that
hinder stable long-distance dependency modelling. We address these limitations
through a geometric reformulation of positional encoding. Drawing inspiration
from Lorentz transformations in hyperbolic geometry, we propose Hyperbolic
Rotary Positional Encoding (HoPE), which leverages hyperbolic functions to
implement Lorentz rotations on token representations. Theoretical analysis
demonstrates that RoPE is a special case of our generalized formulation. HoPE
fundamentally resolves RoPE's slation issues by enforcing monotonic decay of
attention weights with increasing token distances. Extensive experimental
results, including perplexity evaluations under several extended sequence
benchmarks, show that HoPE consistently exceeds existing positional encoding
methods. These findings underscore HoPE's enhanced capacity for representing
and generalizing long-range dependencies. Data and code will be available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决链式思维推理在简单问题上产生过于繁琐输出的问题，需要一种能够动态根据问题难度调整思维深度的方法。

Method: 通过小心筛选包含与问题难度成正比的链式思维追踪的数据进行后训练，使用监督精细调整(SFT)捕捉推理长度和格式模式，结合直接偏好优化(DPO)保持推理准确性。

Result: 数量指标和质性评估都证实，模型能够学会"按比例思考"，在简单问题上最小化推理，同时在复杂问题上保持深度推理。

Conclusion: 无需修改模型架构即可实现动态推理路径，SFT与DPO的组合能够同时减少推理长度并维持或提升性能。

Abstract: Chain-of-thought reasoning, while powerful, can produce unnecessarily verbose
output for simpler problems. We present a framework for difficulty-aware
reasoning that teaches models to dynamically adjust reasoning depth based on
problem complexity. Remarkably, we show that models can be endowed with such
dynamic inference pathways without any architectural modifications; we simply
post-train on data that is carefully curated to include chain-of-thought traces
that are proportional in length to problem difficulty. Our analysis reveals
that post-training via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) primarily captures patterns
like reasoning length and format, while direct preference optimization (DPO)
preserves reasoning accuracy, with their combination reducing length and
maintaining or improving performance. Both quantitative metrics and qualitative
assessments confirm that models can learn to "think proportionally", reasoning
minimally on simple problems while maintaining depth for complex ones.

<details>

Motivation: 基于统一信息密度假说，探索说话者如何利用语言变异性来维持信息传输的一致性，特别是补语连词that的省略模式。

Method: 分析大规模当代对话语料库，使用机器学习和神经语言模型来精炼信息密度估计，比较基于矩阵动词子范畴化概率的传统方法和基于上下文词嵌入的新方法。

Result: 复制了信息密度与that提及之间的既定关系，发现传统方法捕获了大量词汇变异，而基于词嵌入的方法能解释补语连词使用模式的额外方差。

Conclusion: 上下文词嵌入提供了更精确的信息密度估计，能够更好地解释补语连词that的省略模式，支持统一信息密度假说在语言产生中的应用。

Abstract: Speakers often have multiple ways to express the same meaning. The Uniform
Information Density (UID) hypothesis suggests that speakers exploit this
variability to maintain a consistent rate of information transmission during
language production. Building on prior work linking UID to syntactic reduction,
we revisit the finding that the optional complementizer $\textit{that}$in
English complement clauses is more likely to be omitted when the clause has low
information density (i.e., more predictable). We advance this line of research
by analyzing a large-scale, contemporary conversational corpus and using
machine learning and neural language models to refine estimates of information
density. Our results replicated the established relationship between
information density and $\textit{that}$-mentioning. However, we found that
previous measures of information density based on matrix verbs'
subcategorization probability capture substantial idiosyncratic lexical
variation. By contrast, estimates derived from contextual word embeddings
account for additional variance in patterns of complementizer usage.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对线性复杂度序列模型中的衰减机制进行系统性研究，探索其设计空间和性能影响因素。

Method: 从四个维度分析衰减机制：参数化策略、参数共享、衰减粒度和位置编码兼容性，通过多样化语言建模任务进行实验。

Result: 发现1）参数化策略需精心设计，有效配置在特定参数范围内；2）参数共享不能随意使用，会导致性能下降；3）向量衰减通常优于标量衰减，但存在特例；4）RoPE对大多数线性注意力机制无显著改善。

Conclusion: 线性复杂度模型中的衰减机制设计需细致考虑多个维度，不同设计选择对性能有显著影响，需根据具体场景进行优化。

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive investigation into the decay mechanisms
inherent in linear complexity sequence models. We systematically delineate the
design space of decay mechanisms across four pivotal dimensions:
parameterization strategy, which refers to the computational methodology for
decay; parameter sharing, which involves the utilization of supplementary
parameters for decay computation; decay granularity, comparing scalar versus
vector-based decay; and compatibility with relative positional encoding
methods, such as Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE). Through an extensive series
of experiments conducted on diverse language modeling tasks, we uncovered
several critical insights. Firstly, the design of the parameterization strategy
for decay requires meticulous consideration. Our findings indicate that
effective configurations are typically confined to a specific range of
parameters. Secondly, parameter sharing cannot be used arbitrarily, as it may
cause decay values to be too large or too small, thereby significantly
impacting performance. Thirdly, under identical parameterization strategies,
scalar decay generally underperforms compared to its vector-based counterpart.
However, in certain scenarios with alternative parameterization strategies,
scalar decay may unexpectedly surpass vector decay in efficacy. Lastly, our
analysis reveals that RoPE, a commonly employed relative positional encoding
method, typically fails to provide tangible benefits to the majority of linear
attention mechanisms.

Abstract: As the complexity of artificial agents increases, the design of environments
that can effectively shape their behavior and capabilities has become a
critical research frontier. We propose a framework that extends this principle
to a novel class of agents: biological neural networks in the form of neural
organoids. This paper introduces three scalable, closed-loop virtual
environments designed to train organoid-based biological agents and probe the
underlying mechanisms of learning, such as long-term potentiation (LTP) and
long-term depression (LTD). We detail the design of three distinct task
environments with increasing complexity: (1) a conditional avoidance task, (2)
a one-dimensional predator-prey scenario, and (3) a replication of the classic
Pong game. For each environment, we formalize the state and action spaces, the
sensory encoding and motor decoding mechanisms, and the feedback protocols
based on predictable (reward) and unpredictable (punishment) stimulation.
Furthermore, we propose a novel meta-learning approach where a Large Language
Model (LLM) is used to automate the generation and optimization of experimental
protocols, scaling the process of environment and curriculum design. Finally,
we outline a multi-modal approach for evaluating learning by measuring synaptic
plasticity at electrophysiological, cellular, and molecular levels. This work
bridges the gap between computational neuroscience and agent-based AI, offering
a unique platform for studying embodiment, learning, and intelligence in a
controlled biological substrate.

Motivation: 传统手动创建测试骨架耗时且易出错，特别是在教育和大规模开发环境中，需要自动化解决方案来提高测试驱动开发的效率。

Method: 使用四种LLM为真实世界的Ruby类生成RSpec测试骨架，通过静态分析和盲审专家评审评估结构正确性、清晰度、可维护性和测试最佳实践符合度。

Abstract: This paper explores the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate the
generation of test skeletons -- structural templates that outline unit test
coverage without implementing full test logic. Test skeletons are especially
important in test-driven development (TDD), where they provide an early
framework for systematic verification. Traditionally authored manually, their
creation can be time-consuming and error-prone, particularly in educational or
large-scale development settings. We evaluate four LLMs -- GPT-4,
DeepSeek-Chat, Llama4-Maverick, and Gemma2-9B -- on their ability to generate
RSpec skeletons for a real-world Ruby class developed in a university software
engineering course. Each model's output is assessed using static analysis and a
blind expert review to measure structural correctness, clarity,
maintainability, and conformance to testing best practices. The study reveals
key differences in how models interpret code structure and testing conventions,
offering insights into the practical challenges of using LLMs for automated
test scaffolding. Our results show that DeepSeek generated the most
maintainable and well-structured skeletons, while GPT-4 produced more complete
but conventionally inconsistent output. The study reveals prompt design and
contextual input as key quality factors.

Conclusion: NovaQ框架通过多样性引导的测试方法，能够有效探索未充分测试的程序行为，提高量子程序测试效果

Abstract: Quantum programs are designed to run on quantum computers, leveraging quantum
circuits to solve problems that are intractable for classical machines. As
quantum computing advances, ensuring the reliability of quantum programs has
become increasingly important. This paper introduces NovaQ, a diversity-guided
testing framework for quantum programs. NovaQ combines a distribution-based
test case generator with a novelty-driven evaluation module. The generator
produces diverse quantum state inputs by mutating circuit parameters, while the
evaluator quantifies behavioral novelty based on internal circuit state
metrics, including magnitude, phase, and entanglement. By selecting inputs that
map to infrequently covered regions in the metric space, NovaQ effectively
explores under-tested program behaviors. We evaluate NovaQ on quantum programs
of varying sizes and complexities. Experimental results show that NovaQ
consistently achieves higher test input diversity and detects more bugs than
existing baseline approaches.

TL;DR: 利用LLM从资源丰富的语言生成新兴语言的代码变更合成数据，解决代码审查分类中标注数据不足的问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 新兴编程语言和框架缺乏足够的标注数据来训练代码审查分类模型，而大量未标注代码可用

Method: 使用LLM将资源丰富语言的代码变更翻译成新兴语言的等效变更，生成合成训练数据，然后训练监督分类器

Result: 实验表明LLM生成的合成数据能有效引导审查推荐系统，在低资源环境下缩小性能差距

Conclusion: 该方法为扩展自动化代码审查能力到快速发展的技术栈提供了可扩展途径，即使在没有标注数据的情况下

Abstract: Automating the decision of whether a code change requires manual review is
vital for maintaining software quality in modern development workflows.
However, the emergence of new programming languages and frameworks creates a
critical bottleneck: while large volumes of unlabelled code are readily
available, there is an insufficient amount of labelled data to train supervised
models for review classification. We address this challenge by leveraging Large
Language Models (LLMs) to translate code changes from well-resourced languages
into equivalent changes in underrepresented or emerging languages, generating
synthetic training data where labelled examples are scarce. We assume that
although LLMs have learned the syntax and semantics of new languages from
available unlabelled code, they have yet to fully grasp which code changes are
considered significant or review-worthy within these emerging ecosystems. To
overcome this, we use LLMs to generate synthetic change examples and train
supervised classifiers on them. We systematically compare the performance of
these classifiers against models trained on real labelled data. Our experiments
across multiple GitHub repositories and language pairs demonstrate that
LLM-generated synthetic data can effectively bootstrap review recommendation
systems, narrowing the performance gap even in low-resource settings. This
approach provides a scalable pathway to extend automated code review
capabilities to rapidly evolving technology stacks, even in the absence of
annotated data.

analyzing README files and issues discussions to identify the presence of
motivator and demotivator previously synthesized in our literature review [ 8]
study. Results: Motivators such as engagement and motivation (227 hits),
software engineering process understanding (133 hits), and programming

in evaluating learning outcomes and difficulty in curriculum redesign recorded
no hits across the repositories. Conclusion: The study provides early empirical
validation of motivators/demotivators taxonomies with respect to their themes,
highlights research practice gaps, and lays the foundation for developing a
comprehensive framework to guide the responsible adoption of LLMs in SE
education.

TL;DR: FuzzRDUCC是一个新型模糊测试框架，通过符号执行从二进制文件中重建def-use链，结合数据流分析来发现传统控制流模糊测试可能遗漏的漏洞。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统灰盒模糊测试主要依赖控制流边覆盖来指导测试用例生成，但这种方法可能忽略仅通过控制流分析难以暴露的漏洞。二进制模糊测试由于对程序内部数据流洞察有限，往往难以实现彻底的代码覆盖和发现隐藏漏洞。

Method: 采用符号执行技术直接从二进制可执行文件重建定义-使用(def-use)链，使用新颖的启发式算法选择相关def-use链而不影响模糊测试的彻底性，识别关键数据流路径并暴露安全漏洞。

Result: 在binutils基准测试中评估显示，FuzzRDUCC能够识别出现有最先进模糊测试工具未发现的独特崩溃。

Conclusion: FuzzRDUCC通过将数据流分析集成到模糊测试过程中，有效增强了漏洞检测能力，为下一代漏洞检测和发现机制提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Binary-only fuzzing often struggles with achieving thorough code coverage and
uncovering hidden vulnerabilities due to limited insight into a program's
internal dataflows. Traditional grey-box fuzzers guide test case generation
primarily using control flow edge coverage, which can overlook bugs not easily
exposed through control flow analysis alone. We argue that integrating dataflow
analysis into the fuzzing process can enhance its effectiveness by revealing
how data propagates through the program, thereby enabling the exploration of
execution paths that control flow-based methods might miss. In this context, we
introduce FuzzRDUCC, a novel fuzzing framework that employs symbolic execution
to reconstruct definition-use (def-use) chains directly from binary
executables. FuzzRDUCC identifies crucial dataflow paths and exposes security
vulnerabilities without incurring excessive computational overhead, due to a
novel heuristic algorithm that selects relevant def-use chains without
affecting the thoroughness of the fuzzing process. We evaluate FuzzRDUCC using
the binutils benchmark and demonstrate that it can identify unique crashes not
found by state-of-the-art fuzzers. Hence, establishing FuzzRDUCC as a feasible
solution for next generation vulnerability detection and discovery mechanisms.

Abstract: This paper introduces a GenAI-driven approach for automated test case
generation, leveraging Large Language Models and Vision-Language Models to
translate natural language requirements and system diagrams into structured

modeling to standardize vehicle signal definitions, improve compatibility
across automotive subsystems, and streamline integration with third-party
testing tools. Generated test cases are executed within the digital.auto
playground, an open and vendor-neutral environment designed to facilitate rapid
validation of software-defined vehicle functionalities. We evaluate our
approach using the Child Presence Detection System use case, demonstrating
substantial reductions in manual test specification effort and rapid execution
of generated tests. Despite significant automation, the generation of test
cases and test scripts still requires manual intervention due to current
limitations in the GenAI pipeline and constraints of the digital.auto platform.

Motivation: 传统网页测试方法主要关注代码覆盖率和负载测试，但往往无法捕捉复杂的用户行为，导致许多可用性问题未被发现。大语言模型和AI代理的出现为网页测试提供了新的可能性。

Method: 开发了WebProber原型框架，给定URL后能够自主探索网站，模拟真实用户交互，识别bug和可用性问题，并生成人类可读的报告。

Abstract: Automated web testing plays a critical role in ensuring high-quality user
experiences and delivering business value. Traditional approaches primarily
focus on code coverage and load testing, but often fall short of capturing
complex user behaviors, leaving many usability issues undetected. The emergence
of large language models (LLM) and AI agents opens new possibilities for web
testing by enabling human-like interaction with websites and a general
awareness of common usability problems. In this work, we present WebProber, a
prototype AI agent-based web testing framework. Given a URL, WebProber
autonomously explores the website, simulating real user interactions,
identifying bugs and usability issues, and producing a human-readable report.
We evaluate WebProber through a case study of 120 academic personal websites,
where it uncovered 29 usability issues--many of which were missed by
traditional tools. Our findings highlight agent-based testing as a promising
direction while outlining directions for developing next-generation,
user-centered testing frameworks.

TL;DR: Q-SafeML是一种针对量子机器学习的安全监控方法，通过量子中心距离度量来检测概念漂移，提高系统透明度和安全性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量子机器学习在安全关键系统中应用日益增多，但由于量子计算的独特性，现有经典机器学习安全监控方法无法直接适用，需要专门的安全机制

Method: 基于SafeML方法，采用量子中心距离度量来评估模型准确性，进行模型依赖的后分类评估，检测操作数据与训练数据之间的距离

Result: 在QCNN和VQC模型上的实验表明，该方法能够实现知情的人类监督，增强系统透明度和安全性

Conclusion: Q-SafeML为量子机器学习提供了有效的安全监控解决方案，解决了量子系统独特表示约束带来的挑战

Abstract: The rise of machine learning in safety-critical systems has paralleled
advancements in quantum computing, leading to the emerging field of Quantum
Machine Learning (QML). While safety monitoring has progressed in classical ML,
existing methods are not directly applicable to QML due to fundamental
differences in quantum computation. Given the novelty of QML, dedicated safety
mechanisms remain underdeveloped. This paper introduces Q-SafeML, a safety
monitoring approach for QML. The method builds on SafeML, a recent method that
utilizes statistical distance measures to assess model accuracy and provide
confidence in the reasoning of an algorithm. An adapted version of Q-SafeML
incorporates quantum-centric distance measures, aligning with the probabilistic
nature of QML outputs. This shift to a model-dependent, post-classification
evaluation represents a key departure from classical SafeML, which is
dataset-driven and classifier-agnostic. The distinction is motivated by the
unique representational constraints of quantum systems, requiring distance
metrics defined over quantum state spaces. Q-SafeML detects distances between
operational and training data addressing the concept drifts in the context of
QML. Experiments on QCNN and VQC Models show that this enables informed human
oversight, enhancing system transparency and safety.

TL;DR: 代表性相似性指标评测框架，系统比较不同相似性量度在区分不同模型家族方面的功效，发现更严格的对齐约束提高区分能力，soft-matching表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前缺乏对不同代表性相似性量度在区分不同模型家族方面的系统性比较，需要一个定量框架来评估它们的区分能力。

Method: 提出量化框架，使用dprime、silhouette系数和ROC-AUC三种补充性区分度量，系统评估RSA、线性预测性、Procrustes和soft matching等常用相似性量度。

Result: 区分能力随着对齐约束的严格程度而系统性提高。在映射基方法中，soft-matching区分能力最高，其次是Procrustes对齐和线性预测性。非拟合方法如RSA也在不同家族间展现强大区分能力。

Conclusion: 这是通过区分能力视角对相似性量度进行的第一个系统比较，明确了它们的相对敏感性，为大规模模型和脑比较选择量度提供了指导。

Abstract: Representational similarity metrics are fundamental tools in neuroscience and
AI, yet we lack systematic comparisons of their discriminative power across
model families. We introduce a quantitative framework to evaluate
representational similarity measures based on their ability to separate model
families-across architectures (CNNs, Vision Transformers, Swin Transformers,
ConvNeXt) and training regimes (supervised vs. self-supervised). Using three
complementary separability measures-dprime from signal detection theory,
silhouette coefficients and ROC-AUC, we systematically assess the
discriminative capacity of commonly used metrics including RSA, linear
predictivity, Procrustes, and soft matching. We show that separability
systematically increases as metrics impose more stringent alignment
constraints. Among mapping-based approaches, soft-matching achieves the highest
separability, followed by Procrustes alignment and linear predictivity.
Non-fitting methods such as RSA also yield strong separability across families.
These results provide the first systematic comparison of similarity metrics
through a separability lens, clarifying their relative sensitivity and guiding
metric choice for large-scale model and brain comparisons.

Motivation: 深度学习在金融领域面临可解释性挑战，传统方法在金融指标评估方面表现不佳，需要专门为金融场景设计的损失函数。

Method: 提出基于复杂比、盈亏和最大回护等金融指标的损失函数，以及交易额正则化方法来限制位置变化频率。

Result: 新的损失函数组合在算法交易指标评估中表现超过传统均方误差损失函数，提升了交易策略和份额优化的预测性能。

Conclusion: 金融基础指标能够有效提升深度学习模型在金融领域的表现，为金融AI提供了更合适的性能评估方法。

Abstract: Deep Learning is evolving fast and integrates into various domains. Finance
is a challenging field for deep learning, especially in the case of
interpretable artificial intelligence (AI). Although classical approaches
perform very well with natural language processing, computer vision, and
forecasting, they are not perfect for the financial world, in which specialists
use different metrics to evaluate model performance.
  We first introduce financially grounded loss functions derived from key
quantitative finance metrics, including the Sharpe ratio, Profit-and-Loss
(PnL), and Maximum Draw down. Additionally, we propose turnover regularization,
a method that inherently constrains the turnover of generated positions within
predefined limits.
  Our findings demonstrate that the proposed loss functions, in conjunction
with turnover regularization, outperform the traditional mean squared error
loss for return prediction tasks when evaluated using algorithmic trading
metrics. The study shows that financially grounded metrics enhance predictive
performance in trading strategies and portfolio optimization.

Conclusion: 该研究提供了一个灵活的框架，能够直接从行为数据中推断生物学习规则，为实验训练协议的设计和行为数字双胞的开发提供了见解

Abstract: Understanding how animals learn is a central challenge in neuroscience, with
growing relevance to the development of animal- or human-aligned artificial
intelligence. However, most existing approaches assume specific parametric
forms for the learning rule (e.g., Q-learning, policy gradient) or are limited
to simplified settings like bandit tasks, which do not involve learning a new
input-output mapping from scratch. In contrast, animals must often learn new
behaviors de novo, which poses a rich challenge for learning-rule inference. We
target this problem by inferring learning rules directly from animal
decision-making data during de novo task learning, a setting that requires
models flexible enough to capture suboptimality, history dependence, and rich
external stimulus integration without strong structural priors. We first
propose a nonparametric framework that parameterizes the per-trial update of
policy weights with a deep neural network (DNN), and validate it by recovering
ground-truth rules in simulation. We then extend to a recurrent variant (RNN)
that captures non-Markovian dynamics by allowing updates to depend on trial
history. Applied to a large behavioral dataset of mice learning a sensory
decision-making task over multiple weeks, our models improved predictions on
held-out data. The inferred rules revealed asymmetric updates after correct
versus error trials and history dependence, consistent with non-Markovian
learning. Overall, these results introduce a flexible framework for inferring
biological learning rules from behavioral data in de novo learning tasks,
providing insights to inform experimental training protocols and the
development of behavioral digital twins.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法假设固定的最大迭代深度，这既昂贵又武断。需要一种能够利用自我改进任务递归结构的方法，在推理时实现多步自我改进。

Method: ExIt通过选择性采样训练过程中遇到的信息丰富的中间部分历史作为新的自我迭代任务实例，训练自我改进策略。可结合显式探索机制维持任务多样性。

Result: 在数学竞赛、多轮工具使用和机器学习工程等多个领域，ExIt策略能够对未见任务实例表现出强大的推理时自我改进能力，并在超出训练平均迭代深度的步数预算内迭代提升性能。

Conclusion: ExIt方法有效解决了固定迭代深度的限制，通过自课程学习实现了推理时的多步自我改进，在多个复杂任务领域展现出良好的泛化能力。

Abstract: Progress in many task domains emerges from repeated revisions to previous
solution attempts. Training agents that can reliably self-improve over such
sequences at inference-time is a natural target for reinforcement learning
(RL), yet the naive approach assumes a fixed maximum iteration depth, which can
be both costly and arbitrary. We present Exploratory Iteration (ExIt), a family
of autocurriculum RL methods that directly exploits the recurrent structure of
self-improvement tasks to train LLMs to perform multi-step self-improvement at
inference-time while only training on the most informative single-step
iterations. ExIt grows a task space by selectively sampling the most
informative intermediate, partial histories encountered during an episode for
continued iteration, treating these starting points as new self-iteration task
instances to train a self-improvement policy. ExIt can further pair with
explicit exploration mechanisms to sustain greater task diversity. Across
several domains, encompassing competition math, multi-turn tool-use, and
machine learning engineering, we demonstrate that ExIt strategies, starting
from either a single or many task instances, can produce policies exhibiting
strong inference-time self-improvement on held-out task instances, and the
ability to iterate towards higher performance over a step budget extending
beyond the average iteration depth encountered during training.

Conclusion: 该适配性采样策略具有广泛适用性，可扩展到其他逆问题，为传统固定数据集训练提供了可扩展的实用替代方案

Abstract: We propose an instance-wise adaptive sampling framework for constructing
compact and informative training datasets for supervised learning of inverse
problem solutions. Typical learning-based approaches aim to learn a
general-purpose inverse map from datasets drawn from a prior distribution, with
the training process independent of the specific test instance. When the prior
has a high intrinsic dimension or when high accuracy of the learned solution is
required, a large number of training samples may be needed, resulting in
substantial data collection costs. In contrast, our method dynamically
allocates sampling effort based on the specific test instance, enabling
significant gains in sample efficiency. By iteratively refining the training
dataset conditioned on the latest prediction, the proposed strategy tailors the
dataset to the geometry of the inverse map around each test instance. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in the inverse scattering problem
under two types of structured priors. Our results show that the advantage of
the adaptive method becomes more pronounced in settings with more complex
priors or higher accuracy requirements. While our experiments focus on a
particular inverse problem, the adaptive sampling strategy is broadly
applicable and readily extends to other inverse problems, offering a scalable
and practical alternative to conventional fixed-dataset training regimes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有单任务学习方法无法充分利用任务间的互补性，且计算资源消耗大，需要开发更高效的多任务学习框架

Method: 基于Chemprop-RDKit骨干网络，引入量子化学描述符增强分子表征，采用指数任务加权方案实现动态损失平衡

Result: 在13个任务中的12个上显著超越单任务基线，具有高预测性能和快速推理能力

Abstract: Prediction for ADMET (Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion, and
Toxicity) plays a crucial role in drug discovery and development, accelerating
the screening and optimization of new drugs. Existing methods primarily rely on
single-task learning (STL), which often fails to fully exploit the
complementarities between tasks. Besides, it requires more computational
resources while training and inference of each task independently. To address
these issues, we propose a new unified Quantum-enhanced and task-Weighted
Multi-Task Learning (QW-MTL) framework, specifically designed for ADMET
classification tasks. Built upon the Chemprop-RDKit backbone, QW-MTL adopts
quantum chemical descriptors to enrich molecular representations with
additional information about the electronic structure and interactions.
Meanwhile, it introduces a novel exponential task weighting scheme that
combines dataset-scale priors with learnable parameters to achieve dynamic loss
balancing across tasks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to
systematically conduct joint multi-task training across all 13 Therapeutics
Data Commons (TDC) classification benchmarks, using leaderboard-style data
splits to ensure a standardized and realistic evaluation setting. Extensive
experimental results show that QW-MTL significantly outperforms single-task
baselines on 12 out of 13 tasks, achieving high predictive performance with
minimal model complexity and fast inference, demonstrating the effectiveness
and efficiency of multi-task molecular learning enhanced by quantum-informed
features and adaptive task weighting.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文将分形共形预测扩展到函数空间，为神经算子提供有限样本覆盖保证，通过离散化映射和渐进收敛方法解决无限维空间中的不确定性量化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经算子在无限维设置中的不确定性量化缺乏有限样本覆盖保证，现有方法需要强分布假设或产生保守覆盖，需要一种能够处理函数值输出的共形预测方法。

Method: 采用两步法：首先在有限维空间中通过输出函数空间的离散化映射建立有限样本覆盖保证，然后通过考虑离散化细化时的渐进收敛将这些保证提升到函数空间。提出回归校正方法在分辨率间传递校准，并引入两个诊断指标。

Result: 经验结果表明，该方法在分辨率变化下保持校准覆盖且变化较小，在超分辨率任务中实现更好的覆盖。

Conclusion: 该方法成功将分形共形预测扩展到函数空间，为神经算子提供了有效的无限维不确定性量化解决方案，通过分解共形半径和提出诊断指标改进了预测质量。

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification for neural operators remains an open problem in
the infinite-dimensional setting due to the lack of finite-sample coverage
guarantees over functional outputs. While conformal prediction offers
finite-sample guarantees in finite-dimensional spaces, it does not directly
extend to function-valued outputs. Existing approaches (Gaussian processes,
Bayesian neural networks, and quantile-based operators) require strong
distributional assumptions or yield conservative coverage. This work extends
split conformal prediction to function spaces following a two step method. We
first establish finite-sample coverage guarantees in a finite-dimensional space
using a discretization map in the output function space. Then these guarantees
are lifted to the function-space by considering the asymptotic convergence as
the discretization is refined. To characterize the effect of resolution, we
decompose the conformal radius into discretization, calibration, and
misspecification components. This decomposition motivates a regression-based
correction to transfer calibration across resolutions. Additionally, we propose
two diagnostic metrics (conformal ensemble score and internal agreement) to
quantify forecast degradation in autoregressive settings. Empirical results
show that our method maintains calibrated coverage with less variation under
resolution shifts and achieves better coverage in super-resolution tasks.

Result: 证明了在理想化设置下该边界是可实现的，并在所有测试数据点共享相同标签的特殊情况下，提供了渐近最优的置信度预测器。

Conclusion: 转导式共形预测存在置信度与效率的基本权衡，预测集大小随置信度要求呈指数增长，这一发现对实际应用中的参数选择具有重要指导意义。

Abstract: Transductive conformal prediction addresses the simultaneous prediction for
multiple data points. Given a desired confidence level, the objective is to
construct a prediction set that includes the true outcomes with the prescribed
confidence. We demonstrate a fundamental trade-off between confidence and
efficiency in transductive methods, where efficiency is measured by the size of
the prediction sets. Specifically, we derive a strict finite-sample bound
showing that any non-trivial confidence level leads to exponential growth in
prediction set size for data with inherent uncertainty. The exponent scales
linearly with the number of samples and is proportional to the conditional
entropy of the data. Additionally, the bound includes a second-order term,
dispersion, defined as the variance of the log conditional probability
distribution. We show that this bound is achievable in an idealized setting.
Finally, we examine a special case of transductive prediction where all test
data points share the same label. We show that this scenario reduces to the
hypothesis testing problem with empirically observed statistics and provide an
asymptotically optimal confidence predictor, along with an analysis of the
error exponent.

Motivation: 尽管注意力机制在Transformer模型中扮演核心角色，但其数学基础以及与特征多义性、叠加和模型性能等概念的关系仍不清楚，需要更好的理论理解。

Method: 在固定多项式回归设置中分析潜在特征的优化过程，证明最优解与注意力块诱导的动态相一致。

Result: 发现Transformer中表示演化的轨迹可以解释为恢复分类最优特征的过程，为注意力机制提供了新的理论解释。

Conclusion: 注意力机制可以被理解为多项式回归框架下的最优特征恢复过程，这为Transformer模型的机制可解释性提供了新的理论基础。

Abstract: Mechanistic interpretability aims to understand how internal components of
modern machine learning models, such as weights, activations, and layers, give
rise to the model's overall behavior. One particularly opaque mechanism is
attention: despite its central role in transformer models, its mathematical
underpinnings and relationship to concepts like feature polysemanticity,
superposition, and model performance remain poorly understood. This paper
establishes a novel connection between attention mechanisms and multinomial
regression. Specifically, we show that in a fixed multinomial regression
setting, optimizing over latent features yields optimal solutions that align
with the dynamics induced by attention blocks. In other words, the evolution of
representations through a transformer can be interpreted as a trajectory that
recovers the optimal features for classification.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 这篇论文研究了在差分隐私模型下的随机凸优化问题，采用Tsybakov噪声条件和梯度的矩条件，提出了不依赖润滑常数的隐私保护算法，并给出了上下界的统计误差绑定。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 作者意图解决传统DP-SCO模型中润滑常数可能极大或无界的情况，通过引入Tsybakov噪声条件和梯度矩条件来提高算法的通用性和性能。

Method: 采用差分隐私技术，对于满足Tsybakov噪声条件和梯度矩条件的凸优化问题，提出了一种不依赖润滑常数的(ε, δ)-DP算法，并分析了不同参数情况下的算法性能。

Result: 在润滑情况下，算法的误差上界为：θ≥2时为O~((r̃2k(1/√n+(√d/nε))^(k-1)/k)^(θ/(θ-1))，该绑定不依赖润滑常数；对于非润滑情况，当隐私预算小时也有类似结果；同时证明了该误差下界为最优。

Conclusion: 论文通过引入梯度矩条件和Tsybakov噪声条件，成功地提出了不依赖润滑常数的差分隐私凸优化算法，并达到了统计上的最优误差绑定，拓展了DP-SCO模型的应用范围。

Abstract: We study Stochastic Convex Optimization in the Differential Privacy model
(DP-SCO). Unlike previous studies, here we assume the population risk function
satisfies the Tsybakov Noise Condition (TNC) with some parameter $\theta>1$,
where the Lipschitz constant of the loss could be extremely large or even
unbounded, but the $\ell_2$-norm gradient of the loss has bounded $k$-th moment
with $k\geq 2$. For the Lipschitz case with $\theta\geq 2$, we first propose an
$(\varepsilon, \delta)$-DP algorithm whose utility bound is
$\Tilde{O}\left(\left(\tilde{r}_{2k}(\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}+(\frac{\sqrt{d}}{n\varepsilon}))^\frac{k-1}{k}\right)^\frac{\theta}{\theta-1}\right)$
in high probability, where $n$ is the sample size, $d$ is the model dimension,
and $\tilde{r}_{2k}$ is a term that only depends on the $2k$-th moment of the
gradient. It is notable that such an upper bound is independent of the
Lipschitz constant. We then extend to the case where
  $\theta\geq \bar{\theta}> 1$ for some known constant $\bar{\theta}$.
Moreover, when the privacy budget $\varepsilon$ is small enough, we show an
upper bound of
$\tilde{O}\left(\left(\tilde{r}_{k}(\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}+(\frac{\sqrt{d}}{n\varepsilon}))^\frac{k-1}{k}\right)^\frac{\theta}{\theta-1}\right)$
even if the loss function is not Lipschitz. For the lower bound, we show that
for any $\theta\geq 2$, the private minimax rate for $\rho$-zero Concentrated
Differential Privacy is lower bounded by
$\Omega\left(\left(\tilde{r}_{k}(\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}+(\frac{\sqrt{d}}{n\sqrt{\rho}}))^\frac{k-1}{k}\right)^\frac{\theta}{\theta-1}\right)$.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 深度学习模型能够准确识别复杂系统中的闪烁模式（flickering），这是一种在气候系统、生态系统等中出现的早期预警信号，预示着系统可能发生临界转变。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 闪烁现象是复杂系统（如气候系统、生态系统、金融市场）中韧性降低的标志性特征，可能预示着难以预测但影响重大的临界状态转变。虽然深度学习在预测临界点方面显示出强大能力，但其在检测闪烁模式方面的潜力尚未被探索。

Method: 使用卷积长短期记忆（CNN LSTM）模型，通过在简单多项式函数加噪声生成的合成时间序列上进行训练，来识别闪烁模式。

Result: 尽管在简化的动力学系统上训练，模型能够泛化到各种随机系统，并在经验数据集（包括睡鼠体温记录和非洲湿润期古气候代用指标）中可靠地检测到闪烁现象。

Conclusion: 深度学习能够从噪声非线性时间序列中提取早期预警信号，为识别广泛动力系统中的不稳定性提供了一个灵活框架。

Abstract: Deep learning offers powerful tools for anticipating tipping points in
complex systems, yet its potential for detecting flickering (noise-driven
switching between coexisting stable states) remains unexplored. Flickering is a
hallmark of reduced resilience in climate systems, ecosystems, financial
markets, and other systems. It can precede critical regime shifts that are
highly impactful but difficult to predict. Here we show that convolutional long
short-term memory (CNN LSTM) models, trained on synthetic time series generated
from simple polynomial functions with additive noise, can accurately identify
flickering patterns. Despite being trained on simplified dynamics, our models
generalize to diverse stochastic systems and reliably detect flickering in
empirical datasets, including dormouse body temperature records and
palaeoclimate proxies from the African Humid Period. These findings demonstrate
that deep learning can extract early warning signals from noisy, nonlinear time
series, providing a flexible framework for identifying instability across a
wide range of dynamical systems.

Method: KRATF包含三个部分：1) 知识图谱构建 - 将地理空间数据库表示为知识图谱；2) 地图匹配 - 使用知识图谱对齐方法和地理空间特征编码器匹配实体；3) 地图合并 - 使用混合整数线性规划公式一致地合并匹配实体。

Result: 实验评估显示，KRATF不仅在地图融合任务中相比最先进方法和基线方法表现出色，其各个模块（如地图匹配和地图合并）也分别优于传统的匹配和合并方法。

Conclusion: KRATF提供了一个完整的学习型地图融合框架，能够有效解决传统方法的局限性，实现高质量的地图数据融合。

Abstract: Digital maps play a crucial role in various applications such as navigation,
fleet management, and ride-sharing, necessitating their accuracy and currency,
which require timely updates. While the majority of geospatial databases (GDBs)
provide high-quality information, their data is (i) limited to specific regions
and/or (ii) missing some entities, even in their covered areas. Map conflation
is the process of augmentation of a GDB using another GDB to conflate missing
spatial features. Existing map conflation methods suffer from two main
limitations: (1) They are designed for the conflation of linear objects (e.g.,
road networks) and cannot simply be extended to non-linear objects, thus
missing information about most entities in the map. (2) They are heuristic
algorithmic approaches that are based on pre-defined rules, unable to learn
entities matching in a data-driven manner. To address these limitations, we
design KRAFT, a learning based approach consisting of three parts: (1)
Knowledge Graph Construction - where each GDB is represented by a knowledge
graph, (2) Map Matching - where we use a knowledge graph alignment method as
well as a geospatial feature encoder to match entities in obtained knowledge
graphs, and (3) Map Merging - where we merge matched entities in the previous
modules in a consistent manner, using a mixed integer linear programming
formulation that fully merges the GDBs without adding any inconsistencies. Our
experimental evaluation shows that not only does KRAFT achieve outstanding
performance compared to state-of-the-art and baseline methods in map conflation
tasks, but each of its modules (e.g., Map Matching and Map Merging) also
separately outperforms traditional matching and merging methods.

Abstract: Hand gesture classification using high-quality structured data such as
videos, images, and hand skeletons is a well-explored problem in computer
vision. Leveraging low-power, cost-effective biosignals, e.g. surface
electromyography (sEMG), allows for continuous gesture prediction on wearables.
In this paper, we demonstrate that learning representations from weak-modality
data that are aligned with those from structured, high-quality data can improve
representation quality and enables zero-shot classification. Specifically, we
propose a Contrastive Pose-EMG Pre-training (CPEP) framework to align EMG and
pose representations, where we learn an EMG encoder that produces high-quality
and pose-informative representations. We assess the gesture classification
performance of our model through linear probing and zero-shot setups. Our model
outperforms emg2pose benchmark models by up to 21% on in-distribution gesture
classification and 72% on unseen (out-of-distribution) gesture classification.

TL;DR: 该文站提出自然谱融合(NSF)方法，通过p指数扩展和周期调度来控制优化器的频谱偏好，实现低频和高频信息的动态平衡，在不改变模型或训练流程的情况下提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 优化器本身存在频谱偏好，这种偏好会重新形成优化路径，需要探索优化器作为频谱控制器的潜力。

Method: 提出NSF方法：1)将优化器视为频谱控制器；2)周期性重新加权频谱带；3)通过p指数扩展第二矩项，支持正负指数；4)使用周期调度实现。

Result: 适配方法强调低频信息，SGD近中性，负指数放大高频信息。周期调度扩寝频谱覆盖范围，提升跨带融合能力，在赖损仍高时就完成决策边界对齐。在多个基准测试中都能一致降低测试误差，某些任务仅需四分之一训练成本即可达到基准精度。

Conclusion: NSF揭示了优化器作为主动频谱控制器的作用，提供了统一、可控制且高效的一阶优化框架。

Abstract: Spectral behaviors have been widely discussed in machine learning, yet the
optimizer's own spectral bias remains unclear. We argue that first-order
optimizers exhibit an intrinsic frequency preference that significantly
reshapes the optimization path. To address this, we propose Natural Spectral
Fusion (NSF): reframing training as controllable spectral coverage and
information fusion rather than merely scaling step sizes. NSF has two core
principles: treating the optimizer as a spectral controller that dynamically
balances low- and high-frequency information; and periodically reweighting
frequency bands at negligible cost, without modifying the model, data, or
training pipeline. We realize NSF via a p-exponent extension of the
second-moment term, enabling both positive and negative exponents, and
implement it through cyclic scheduling. Theory and experiments show that
adaptive methods emphasize low frequencies, SGD is near-neutral, and negative
exponents amplify high-frequency information. Cyclic scheduling broadens
spectral coverage, improves cross-band fusion, and induces early
decision-boundary alignment, where accuracy improves even while loss remains
high. Across multiple benchmarks, with identical learning-rate strategies and
fixed hyperparameters, p-exponent cyclic scheduling consistently reduces test
error and demonstrates distinct convergence behavior; on some tasks, it matches
baseline accuracy with only one-quarter of the training cost. Overall, NSF
reveals the optimizer's role as an active spectral controller and provides a
unified, controllable, and efficient framework for first-order optimization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 主流解码策略如beam search虽然能生成合理的候选集，但缺乏可证明的覆盖保证，且在搜索效率和多样化轨迹需求（特别是长尾序列）之间难以有效平衡。

Method: 提出CoVeR方法，在保形预测框架内构建无模型解码策略，通过理论分析建立PAC风格的泛化边界。

Result: 理论证明CoVeR能够渐近地实现至少1-α的覆盖率，其中α∈(0,1)是任意目标水平。

Conclusion: CoVeR为复杂推理任务提供了一种具有可证明覆盖保证的高效解码方案，特别适用于需要长尾序列的真实应用场景。

Abstract: Autoregressive pre-trained models combined with decoding methods have
achieved impressive performance on complex reasoning tasks. While mainstream
decoding strategies such as beam search can generate plausible candidate sets,
they often lack provable coverage guarantees, and struggle to effectively
balance search efficiency with the need for versatile trajectories,
particularly those involving long-tail sequences that are essential in certain
real-world applications. To address these limitations, we propose
\textsc{CoVeR}, a novel model-free decoding strategy wihtin the conformal
prediction framework that simultaneously maintains a compact search space and
ensures high coverage probability over desirable trajectories. Theoretically,
we establish a PAC-style generalization bound, guaranteeing that \textsc{CoVeR}
asymptotically achieves a coverage rate of at least $1 - \alpha$ for any target
level $\alpha \in (0,1)$.

Method: 提出Beyond I-Con框架，探索替代统计散度（如总变差距离、有界f-散度）和相似性核（如距离核替代角度核），系统性地发现新的损失函数。

Result: (1)无监督聚类：改进PMI算法使用TV距离，在DINO-ViT嵌入上达到SOTA；(2)监督对比学习：使用TV和距离核优于标准方法；(3)降维：使用有界f-散度比SNE获得更好的定性结果和下游任务性能。

Conclusion: 表示学习优化中散度和相似性核的选择至关重要，Beyond I-Con框架为系统探索这些选择提供了有效方法。

Abstract: The Information Contrastive (I-Con) framework revealed that over 23
representation learning methods implicitly minimize KL divergence between data
and learned distributions that encode similarities between data points.
However, a KL-based loss may be misaligned with the true objective, and
properties of KL divergence such as asymmetry and unboundedness may create
optimization challenges. We present Beyond I-Con, a framework that enables
systematic discovery of novel loss functions by exploring alternative
statistical divergences and similarity kernels. Key findings: (1) on
unsupervised clustering of DINO-ViT embeddings, we achieve state-of-the-art
results by modifying the PMI algorithm to use total variation (TV) distance;
(2) on supervised contrastive learning, we outperform the standard approach by
using TV and a distance-based similarity kernel instead of KL and an angular
kernel; (3) on dimensionality reduction, we achieve superior qualitative
results and better performance on downstream tasks than SNE by replacing KL
with a bounded f-divergence. Our results highlight the importance of
considering divergence and similarity kernel choices in representation learning
optimization.

Motivation: 现有的简化Transformer架构（如CATS）虽然提高了效率和准确性，但可能忽略了传统统计模型（如VARMA）能够有效捕捉的细粒度局部时间依赖性。

Method: 提出VARMAformer架构，包含两个关键创新：1）VARMA启发的特征提取器（VFE），在patch级别显式建模自回归和移动平均模式；2）VARMA增强注意力机制（VE-atten），使用时序门控使查询更具上下文感知能力。

Conclusion: 这项工作验证了将经典统计洞察融入现代深度学习框架对时间序列预测的显著益处，能够同时捕捉全局长程依赖性和局部统计结构。

Abstract: Transformer-based models have significantly advanced time series forecasting.
Recent work, like the Cross-Attention-only Time Series transformer (CATS),
shows that removing self-attention can make the model more accurate and
efficient. However, these streamlined architectures may overlook the
fine-grained, local temporal dependencies effectively captured by classical
statistical models like Vector AutoRegressive Moving Average model (VARMA). To
address this gap, we propose VARMAformer, a novel architecture that synergizes
the efficiency of a cross-attention-only framework with the principles of
classical time series analysis. Our model introduces two key innovations: (1) a
dedicated VARMA-inspired Feature Extractor (VFE) that explicitly models
autoregressive (AR) and moving-average (MA) patterns at the patch level, and
(2) a VARMA-Enhanced Attention (VE-atten) mechanism that employs a temporal
gate to make queries more context-aware. By fusing these classical insights
into a modern backbone, VARMAformer captures both global, long-range
dependencies and local, statistical structures. Through extensive experiments
on widely-used benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that our model consistently
outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods. Our work validates the
significant benefit of integrating classical statistical insights into modern
deep learning frameworks for time series forecasting.

Abstract: With increasing concerns about privacy attacks and potential sensitive
information leakage, researchers have actively explored methods to efficiently
remove sensitive training data and reduce privacy risks in graph neural network
(GNN) models. Node unlearning has emerged as a promising technique for
protecting the privacy of sensitive nodes by efficiently removing specific
training node information from GNN models. However, existing node unlearning
methods either impose restrictions on the GNN structure or do not effectively
utilize the graph topology for node unlearning. Some methods even compromise
the graph's topology, making it challenging to achieve a satisfactory
performance-complexity trade-off. To address these issues and achieve efficient
unlearning for training node removal in GNNs, we propose three novel node
unlearning methods: Class-based Label Replacement, Topology-guided Neighbor
Mean Posterior Probability, and Class-consistent Neighbor Node Filtering. Among
these methods, Topology-guided Neighbor Mean Posterior Probability and
Class-consistent Neighbor Node Filtering effectively leverage the topological
features of the graph, resulting in more effective node unlearning. To validate
the superiority of our proposed methods in node unlearning, we conducted
experiments on three benchmark datasets. The evaluation criteria included model
utility, unlearning utility, and unlearning efficiency. The experimental
results demonstrate the utility and efficiency of the proposed methods and
illustrate their superiority compared to state-of-the-art node unlearning
methods. Overall, the proposed methods efficiently remove sensitive training
nodes and protect the privacy information of sensitive nodes in GNNs. The
findings contribute to enhancing the privacy and security of GNN models and
provide valuable insights into the field of node unlearning.

Conclusion: 该框架成功使RL代理能够持续学习，灵感来源于人类大脑的决策机制，为解决灾难性遗忘问题提供了有效方案

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (RL) models, despite their efficiency in learning
an optimal policy in static environments, easily loses previously learned
knowledge (i.e., catastrophic forgetting). It leads RL models to poor
performance in continual reinforcement learning (CRL) scenarios. To address
this, we present an arbitration control mechanism over an ensemble of RL
agents. It is motivated by and closely aligned with how humans make decisions
in a CRL context using an arbitration control of multiple RL agents in parallel
as observed in the prefrontal cortex. We integrated two key ideas into our
model: (1) an ensemble of RLs (i.e., DQN variants) explicitly trained to have
diverse value functions and (2) an arbitration control that prioritizes agents
with higher reliability (i.e., less error) in recent trials. We propose a
framework for CRL, an Arbitration Control for an Ensemble of Diversified DQN
variants (ACED-DQN). We demonstrate significant performance improvements in
both static and continual environments, supported by empirical evidence showing
the effectiveness of arbitration control over diversified DQNs during training.
In this work, we introduced a framework that enables RL agents to continuously
learn, with inspiration from the human brain.

Abstract: Time series forecasting plays a critical role in decision-making processes
across diverse fields including meteorology, traffic, electricity, economics,
finance, and so on. Especially, predicting returns on financial instruments is
a challenging problem. Some researchers have proposed time series foundation
models applicable to various forecasting tasks. Simultaneously, based on the
recognition that real-world time series exhibit chaotic properties, methods
have been developed to artificially generate synthetic chaotic time series,
construct diverse datasets and train models. In this study, we propose a
methodology for modeling financial time series by generating artificial chaotic
time series and applying resampling techniques to simulate financial time
series data, which we then use as training samples. Increasing the resampling
interval to extend predictive horizons, we conducted large-scale pre-training
using 10 billion training samples for each case. We subsequently created test
datasets for multiple timeframes using actual Bitcoin trade data and performed
zero-shot prediction without re-training the pre-trained model. The results of
evaluating the profitability of a simple trading strategy based on these
predictions demonstrated significant performance improvements over
autocorrelation models. During the large-scale pre-training process, we
observed a scaling law-like phenomenon that we can achieve predictive
performance at a certain level with extended predictive horizons for chaotic
time series by increasing the number of training samples exponentially. If this
scaling law proves robust and holds true across various chaotic models, it
suggests the potential to predict near-future events by investing substantial
computational resources. Future research should focus on further large-scale
training and verifying the applicability of this scaling law to diverse chaotic
models.

Abstract: The limited ability to reason across occupational data from different sources
is a long-standing bottleneck for data-driven labour market analytics. Previous
research has relied on hand-crafted ontologies that allow such reasoning but
are computationally expensive and require careful maintenance by human experts.
The rise of language processing machine learning models offers a scalable
alternative by learning shared semantic spaces that bridge diverse occupational
vocabularies without extensive human curation. We present an embedding-based
alignment process that links any free-form German job title to two established
ontologies - the German Klassifikation der Berufe and the International
Standard Classification of Education. Using publicly available data from the
German Federal Employment Agency, we construct a dataset to fine-tune a
Sentence-BERT model to learn the structure imposed by the ontologies. The
enriched pairs (job title, embedding) define a similarity graph structure that
we can use for efficient approximate nearest-neighbour search, allowing us to
frame the classification process as a semantic search problem. This allows for
greater flexibility, e.g., adding more classes. We discuss design decisions,
open challenges, and outline ongoing work on extending the graph with other
ontologies and multilingual titles.

Abstract: Blinks in electroencephalography (EEG) are often treated as unwanted
artifacts. However, recent studies have demonstrated that blink rate and its
variability are important physiological markers to monitor cognitive load,
attention, and potential neurological disorders. This paper addresses the
critical task of accurate blink detection by evaluating various deep learning
models for segmenting EEG signals into involuntary blinks and non-blinks. We
present a pipeline for blink detection using 1, 3, or 5 frontal EEG electrodes.
The problem is formulated as a sequence-to-sequence task and tested on various
deep learning architectures including standard recurrent neural networks,
convolutional neural networks (both standard and depth-wise), temporal
convolutional networks (TCN), transformer-based models, and hybrid
architectures. The models were trained on raw EEG signals with minimal
pre-processing. Training and testing was carried out on a public dataset of 31
subjects collected at UCSD. This dataset consisted of 15 healthy participants
and 16 patients with Parkinson's disease allowing us to verify the model's
robustness to tremor. Out of all models, CNN-RNN hybrid model consistently
outperformed other models and achieved the best blink detection accuracy of
93.8%, 95.4% and 95.8% with 1, 3, and 5 channels in the healthy cohort and
correspondingly 73.8%, 75.4% and 75.8% in patients with PD. The paper compares
neural networks for the task of segmenting EEG recordings to involuntary blinks
and no blinks allowing for computing blink rate and other statistics.

TL;DR: 本文提出使用双随机归一化方法来分解混淆矩阵中的类别相似性和分布偏差因素，从而更准确地诊断模型行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 混淆矩阵的值同时受到类别相似性（模型混淆两个类别的难易程度）和分布偏差（训练集和测试集的偏斜分布）的影响，难以区分两者的独立贡献。

Method: 引入基于迭代比例拟合的双随机归一化方法，这是行和列归一化的推广，能够恢复类别相似性的底层结构。

Result: 该方法能够分离误差来源，支持更精准的模型行为诊断和针对性改进。同时揭示了混淆矩阵归一化与模型内部类别表示之间的对应关系。

Conclusion: 双随机归一化提供了一种几何解释框架，能够更深入地理解分类器的归一化过程及其揭示的信息。

Abstract: The confusion matrix is a standard tool for evaluating classifiers by
providing insights into class-level errors. In heterogeneous settings, its
values are shaped by two main factors: class similarity -- how easily the model
confuses two classes -- and distribution bias, arising from skewed
distributions in the training and test sets. However, confusion matrix values
reflect a mix of both factors, making it difficult to disentangle their
individual contributions. To address this, we introduce bistochastic
normalization using Iterative Proportional Fitting, a generalization of row and
column normalization. Unlike standard normalizations, this method recovers the
underlying structure of class similarity. By disentangling error sources, it
enables more accurate diagnosis of model behavior and supports more targeted
improvements. We also show a correspondence between confusion matrix
normalizations and the model's internal class representations. Both standard
and bistochastic normalizations can be interpreted geometrically in this space,
offering a deeper understanding of what normalization reveals about a
classifier.

TL;DR: NeuSA是一种基于谱方法的物理信息神经网络，通过谱基投影和神经ODE集成解决PINNs在复杂初值问题中的收敛困难、因果性违反和频谱偏差问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准MLP-based PINNs在处理复杂初值问题时经常无法收敛，导致解违反因果性并存在对低频分量的频谱偏差。

Method: NeuSA学习PDE在谱基上的投影，获得动力学的有限维表示，然后通过适应的神经ODE进行积分，利用谱表示的高频分量克服频谱偏差，继承NODE的因果结构强制因果性，并基于经典方法的初始化方案在目标解附近开始训练。

Result: 在线性和非线性波动方程的经典基准测试中，NeuSA相比其他架构表现出更强的性能，具有更快的收敛速度、改进的时间一致性和更高的预测精度。

Conclusion: NeuSA通过结合谱方法和神经ODE，有效解决了PINNs在复杂PDE求解中的关键问题，为物理信息神经网络提供了新的架构方向。

Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have emerged as a powerful neural
framework for solving partial differential equations (PDEs). However, standard
MLP-based PINNs often fail to converge when dealing with complex initial-value
problems, leading to solutions that violate causality and suffer from a
spectral bias towards low-frequency components. To address these issues, we
introduce NeuSA (Neuro-Spectral Architectures), a novel class of PINNs inspired
by classical spectral methods, designed to solve linear and nonlinear PDEs with
variable coefficients. NeuSA learns a projection of the underlying PDE onto a
spectral basis, leading to a finite-dimensional representation of the dynamics
which is then integrated with an adapted Neural ODE (NODE). This allows us to
overcome spectral bias, by leveraging the high-frequency components enabled by
the spectral representation; to enforce causality, by inheriting the causal
structure of NODEs, and to start training near the target solution, by means of
an initialization scheme based on classical methods. We validate NeuSA on
canonical benchmarks for linear and nonlinear wave equations, demonstrating
strong performance as compared to other architectures, with faster convergence,
improved temporal consistency and superior predictive accuracy. Code and
pretrained models will be released.

Abstract: This paper proposes a topology-aware graph reinforcement learning approach to
address the routing policy optimization problem in cloud server environments.
The method builds a unified framework for state representation and structural
evolution by integrating a Structure-Aware State Encoding (SASE) module and a
Policy-Adaptive Graph Update (PAGU) mechanism. It aims to tackle the challenges
of decision instability and insufficient structural awareness under dynamic
topologies. The SASE module models node states through multi-layer graph
convolution and structural positional embeddings, capturing high-order
dependencies in the communication topology and enhancing the expressiveness of
state representations. The PAGU module adjusts the graph structure based on
policy behavior shifts and reward feedback, enabling adaptive structural
updates in dynamic environments. Experiments are conducted on the real-world
GEANT topology dataset, where the model is systematically evaluated against
several representative baselines in terms of throughput, latency control, and
link balance. Additional experiments, including hyperparameter sensitivity,
graph sparsity perturbation, and node feature dimensionality variation, further
explore the impact of structure modeling and graph updates on model stability
and decision quality. Results show that the proposed method outperforms
existing graph reinforcement learning models across multiple performance
metrics, achieving efficient and robust routing in dynamic and complex cloud
networks.

Motivation: 测试时自适应在真实部署中面临三个主要挑战：混合分布偏移、小批量数据和在线不平衡标签分布，这些因素导致现有TTA方法性能下降甚至失效，阻碍了实际应用。

Method: 提出SAR方法：1）通过梯度感知移除噪声样本；2）使用平坦最小化使模型对剩余噪声鲁棒。进一步提出SAR²：1）冗余正则器减少特征相关性；2）不公平正则器最大化原型质心预测熵以防止表示偏置。

Result: 实验结果表明，SAR和SAR²方法在多种测试场景下比现有方法表现更稳定，计算效率高，能有效防止模型崩溃问题。

Conclusion: 批量归一化层是TTA不稳定的关键因素，通过梯度感知样本筛选和平坦最小化优化，结合表示层面的正则化约束，可以有效提升TTA在真实场景中的稳定性和性能。

Abstract: Test-time adaptation (TTA) may fail to improve or even harm the model
performance when test data have: 1) mixed distribution shifts, 2) small batch
sizes, 3) online imbalanced label distribution shifts. This is often a key
obstacle preventing existing TTA methods from being deployed in the real world.
In this paper, we investigate the unstable reasons and find that the batch norm
layer is a crucial factor hindering TTA stability. Conversely, TTA can perform
more stably with batch-agnostic norm layers, i.e., group or layer norm.
However, we observe that TTA with group and layer norms does not always succeed
and still suffers many failure cases, i.e., the model collapses into trivial
solutions by assigning the same class label for all samples. By digging into
this, we find that, during the collapse process: 1) the model gradients often
undergo an initial explosion followed by rapid degradation, suggesting that
certain noisy test samples with large gradients may disrupt adaptation; and 2)
the model representations tend to exhibit high correlations and classification
bias. To address this, we first propose a sharpness-aware and reliable entropy
minimization method, called SAR, for stabilizing TTA from two aspects: 1)
remove partial noisy samples with large gradients, 2) encourage model weights
to go to a flat minimum so that the model is robust to the remaining noisy
samples. Based on SAR, we further introduce SAR^2 to prevent representation
collapse with two regularizers: 1) a redundancy regularizer to reduce
inter-dimensional correlations among centroid-invariant features; and 2) an
inequity regularizer to maximize the prediction entropy of a prototype
centroid, thereby penalizing biased representations toward any specific class.
Promising results demonstrate that our methods perform more stably over prior
methods and are computationally efficient under the above wild test scenarios.

Abstract: Directed evolution is an iterative laboratory process of designing proteins
with improved function by iteratively synthesizing new protein variants and
evaluating their desired property with expensive and time-consuming biochemical
screening. Machine learning methods can help select informative or promising
variants for screening to increase their quality and reduce the amount of
necessary screening. In this paper, we present a novel method for
machine-learning-assisted directed evolution of proteins which combines
Bayesian optimization with informative representation of protein variants
extracted from a pre-trained protein language model. We demonstrate that the
new representation based on the sequence embeddings significantly improves the
performance of Bayesian optimization yielding better results with the same
number of conducted screening in total. At the same time, our method
outperforms the state-of-the-art machine-learning-assisted directed evolution
methods with regression objective.

Motivation: 现有的初始化方法如Glorot、He、正交矩阵等都注重保持激活值和梯度传播的单位方差，但在深度网络中这种假设并不有效。需要从第一层到最后一层渐进地增加方差。

Method: 提出了一种新的初始化方法，考虑每个层的深度信息和整个网络的深度，以灵活的方式增加网络的方差。

Result: 实验结果显示，提出的方法在深度网络中表现超过了现有的初始化方案。

Conclusion: 通过考虑每个层的深度信息来灵活调整网络方差，可以实现更好的深度网络初始化效果。

Abstract: In past few years, various initialization schemes have been proposed. These
schemes are glorot initialization, He initialization, initialization using
orthogonal matrix, random walk method for initialization. Some of these methods
stress on keeping unit variance of activation and gradient propagation through
the network layer. Few of these methods are independent of the depth
information while some methods has considered the total network depth for
better initialization. In this paper, comprehensive study has been done where
depth information of each layer as well as total network is incorporated for
better initialization scheme. It has also been studied that for deeper networks
theoretical assumption of unit variance throughout the network does not perform
well. It requires the need to increase the variance of the network from first
layer activation to last layer activation. We proposed a novel way to increase
the variance of the network in flexible manner, which incorporates the
information of each layer depth. Experiments shows that proposed method
performs better than the existing initialization scheme.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of time-to-event outcomes is a central challenge in
oncology, with significant implications for treatment planning and patient
management. In this work, we present MultiSurv, a multimodal deep survival
model utilising DeepHit with a projection layer and inter-modality
cross-attention, which integrates heterogeneous patient data, including
clinical, MRI, RNA-seq and whole-slide pathology features. The model is
designed to capture complementary prognostic signals across modalities and
estimate individualised time-to-biochemical recurrence in prostate cancer and
time-to-cancer recurrence in bladder cancer. Our approach was evaluated in the
context of the CHIMERA Grand Challenge, across two of the three provided tasks.
For Task 1 (prostate cancer bio-chemical recurrence prediction), the proposed
framework achieved a concordance index (C-index) of 0.843 on 5-folds
cross-validation and 0.818 on CHIMERA development set, demonstrating robust
discriminatory ability. For Task 3 (bladder cancer recurrence prediction), the
model obtained a C-index of 0.662 on 5-folds cross-validation and 0.457 on
development set, highlighting its adaptability and potential for clinical
translation. These results suggest that leveraging multimodal integration with
deep survival learning provides a promising pathway toward personalised risk
stratification in prostate and bladder cancer. Beyond the challenge setting,
our framework is broadly applicable to survival prediction tasks involving
heterogeneous biomedical data.

Abstract: The primary paradigm in Neural Combinatorial Optimization (NCO) are
construction methods, where a neural network is trained to sequentially add one
solution component at a time until a complete solution is constructed. We
observe that the typical changes to the state between two steps are small,
since usually only the node that gets added to the solution is removed from the
state. An efficient model should be able to reuse computation done in prior
steps. To that end, we propose to train a recurrent encoder that computes the
state embeddings not only based on the state but also the embeddings of the
step before. We show that the recurrent encoder can achieve equivalent or
better performance than a non-recurrent encoder even if it consists of
$3\times$ fewer layers, thus significantly improving on latency. We demonstrate
our findings on three different problems: the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP),
the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP), and the Orienteering Problem
(OP) and integrate the models into a large neighborhood search algorithm, to

*Rafael Bischof,Michal Piovarči,Michael A. Kraus,Siddhartha Mishra,Bernd Bickel*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HyPINO是一个多物理神经算子，通过超网络和混合监督实现参数化PDE的零样本泛化，无需任务特定微调，在多个基准测试中优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统PINNs需要针对每个PDE问题单独训练的问题，开发一个能够零样本泛化到各类参数化PDE的通用神经算子，提高计算效率和准确性。

Method: 使用Swin Transformer超网络结合混合监督：基于MMS的解析解标签数据和物理信息无标签数据。模型将PDE参数映射到目标PINNs，并引入迭代精化过程生成集成解。

Result: 在7个基准问题上实现强零样本精度，优于U-Nets、Poseidon和PINO。迭代精化使平均L2损失降低100倍，微调初始化后收敛更快且误差更低。

Conclusion: HyPINO为扩展神经算子解决复杂非线性高维PDE问题提供了可扩展的基础方法，显著提高了精度并降低了计算成本。

Abstract: We present HyPINO, a multi-physics neural operator designed for zero-shot
generalization across a broad class of parametric PDEs without requiring
task-specific fine-tuning. Our approach combines a Swin Transformer-based
hypernetwork with mixed supervision: (i) labeled data from analytical solutions
generated via the Method of Manufactured Solutions (MMS), and (ii) unlabeled
samples optimized using physics-informed objectives. The model maps PDE
parametrizations to target Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) and can
handle linear elliptic, hyperbolic, and parabolic equations in two dimensions
with varying source terms, geometries, and mixed Dirichlet/Neumann boundary
conditions, including interior boundaries. HyPINO achieves strong zero-shot
accuracy on seven benchmark problems from PINN literature, outperforming
U-Nets, Poseidon, and Physics-Informed Neural Operators (PINO). Further, we
introduce an iterative refinement procedure that compares the physics of the
generated PINN to the requested PDE and uses the discrepancy to generate a
"delta" PINN. Summing their contributions and repeating this process forms an
ensemble whose combined solution progressively reduces the error on six
benchmarks and achieves over 100x gain in average $L_2$ loss in the best case,
while retaining forward-only inference. Additionally, we evaluate the
fine-tuning behavior of PINNs initialized by HyPINO and show that they converge
faster and to lower final error than both randomly initialized and
Reptile-meta-learned PINNs on five benchmarks, performing on par on the
remaining two. Our results highlight the potential of this scalable approach as
a foundation for extending neural operators toward solving increasingly
complex, nonlinear, and high-dimensional PDE problems with significantly
improved accuracy and reduced computational cost.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 细粒度标签训练并不总能提升分类性能，其效果取决于数据几何结构、标签层次关系、数据集大小和模型容量等因素


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究在层次化标签分类问题中，使用更细粒度的标签进行训练是否能普遍提升模型性能，以及影响这种策略效果的关键因素

Method: 使用真实和合成数据集进行实验，分析数据几何结构、标签层次关系、数据集大小和模型容量对细粒度标签训练效果的影响

Result: 细粒度标签训练并非普遍有效，其效果高度依赖于数据几何结构与标签层次的关系，以及数据集规模和模型能力

Conclusion: 细粒度标签训练策略的有效性是有条件的，需要根据具体的数据特征和任务要求来选择是否使用这种训练方式

Abstract: In classification problems, models must predict a class label based on the
input data features. However, class labels are organized hierarchically in many
datasets. While a classification task is often defined at a specific level of
this hierarchy, training can utilize a finer granularity of labels. Empirical
evidence suggests that such fine-grained training can enhance performance. In
this work, we investigate the generality of this observation and explore its
underlying causes using both real and synthetic datasets. We show that training
on fine-grained labels does not universally improve classification accuracy.
Instead, the effectiveness of this strategy depends critically on the geometric
structure of the data and its relations with the label hierarchy. Additionally,
factors such as dataset size and model capacity significantly influence whether
fine-grained labels provide a performance benefit.

Motivation: 传统学习理论主要研究在非自适应对手下的学习问题，但现实世界中对手往往能够观察到学习者请求的样本并进行针对性修改，因此需要研究更强大的自适应对手模型。

Method: 提出了一个考虑对手预算的通用自适应对手学习性概念框架，通过理论分析比较了自适应和非自适应对手下的学习性条件。

Result: 证明了在加性自适应对手下的可学习性确实比加性非自适应对手下的可学习性条件更严格，即前者是后者的严格强条件。

Conclusion: 自适应对手模型为学习理论提供了更现实的威胁模型，研究结果表明对抗这种更强大的对手需要更强的学习性保证。

Abstract: We consider the question of learnability of distribution classes in the
presence of adaptive adversaries -- that is, adversaries capable of
intercepting the samples requested by a learner and applying manipulations with
full knowledge of the samples before passing it on to the learner. This stands
in contrast to oblivious adversaries, who can only modify the underlying
distribution the samples come from but not their i.i.d.\ nature. We formulate a
general notion of learnability with respect to adaptive adversaries, taking
into account the budget of the adversary. We show that learnability with
respect to additive adaptive adversaries is a strictly stronger condition than
learnability with respect to additive oblivious adversaries.

Abstract: Federated learning has the potential to unlock siloed data and distributed
resources by enabling collaborative model training without sharing private
data. As more complex foundational models gain widespread use, the need to
expand training resources and integrate privately owned data grows as well. In
this article, we explore the intersection of federated learning and
foundational models, aiming to identify, categorize, and characterize technical
methods that integrate the two paradigms. As a unified survey is currently
unavailable, we present a literature survey structured around a novel taxonomy
that follows the development life-cycle stages, along with a technical
comparison of available methods. Additionally, we provide practical insights
and guidelines for implementing and evolving these methods, with a specific
focus on the healthcare domain as a case study, where the potential impact of
federated learning and foundational models is considered significant. Our
survey covers multiple intersecting topics, including but not limited to
federated learning, self-supervised learning, fine-tuning, distillation, and
transfer learning. Initially, we retrieved and reviewed a set of over 4,200
articles. This collection was narrowed to more than 250 thoroughly reviewed
articles through inclusion criteria, featuring 42 unique methods. The methods
were used to construct the taxonomy and enabled their comparison based on
complexity, efficiency, and scalability. We present these results as a
self-contained overview that not only summarizes the state of the field but
also provides insights into the practical aspects of adopting, evolving, and
integrating foundational models with federated learning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 基于注意力导向的层适配复合token压缩框架，通过注意力分数评估token重要性，选择头特异性token并对齐到统一缓存结构，同时通过全局分配机制适配各层保留预算，在保持准确性的同时大幅减少KV缓存占用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM使用KV缓存进行自回归解码，但缓存大小随上下文长度和模型深度线性增长，成为长上下文推理的主要瓶颈。现有压缩方法或过于固化，或打破张量布局，或需专门计算内核。

Method: 提出注意力导向的层适配复合token压缩框架：1）聚合注意力分数估计token重要性；2）独立选择每个注意头的特定关键token；3）将关键token对齐到复合token中，保持统一缓存结构；4）全局分配机制根据各层信息密度动态分配保留容量。

Result: 方法实现了显著的内存减少，同时保持了模型准确性，在结构化和半结构化方法中均表现更优。

Conclusion: 该方法简单有效，完全兼容现有标准推理流程，为高效长上下文LLM部署提供了实用可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) rely on key-value (KV) caches for efficient
autoregressive decoding; however, cache size grows linearly with context length
and model depth, becoming a major bottleneck in long-context inference. Prior
KV cache compression methods either enforce rigid heuristics, disrupt tensor
layouts with per-attention-head variability, or require specialized compute
kernels.
  We propose a simple, yet effective, KV cache compression framework based on
attention-guided, layer-adaptive composite tokens. Our method aggregates
attention scores to estimate token importance, selects head-specific tokens
independently, and aligns them into composite tokens that respect the uniform
cache structure required by existing inference engines. A global allocation
mechanism further adapts retention budgets across layers, assigning more
capacity to layers with informative tokens. This approach achieves significant
memory reduction while preserving accuracy, consistently outperforming prior
structured and semi-structured methods. Crucially, our approach remains fully
compatible with standard inference pipelines, offering a practical and scalable
solution for efficient long-context LLM deployment.

Motivation: 深度学习模型在生物医学信号处理中展现了强大潜力，但其计算资源需求高，特别是在实时检测或资源有限的环境中面临挑战。需要开发更高效、轻量化的模型来提高狂狂检测的效率和可靠性。

Method: 设计了一种轻量化的一维CNN模型，采用结构化剪剪技术（移除50%的卷积内核）来减少模型复杂度。同时使用轻度早停止技术来防止过拟合。

Result: 基线CNN模型达到了92.78%的准确率和0.8686的宏观F1分数。经过剪剪后，模型在权重和内存需求减少50%的情况下，准确率提升到92.87%，宏观F1分数提升到0.8707，保持了预测能力。

Conclusion: 结构化剪剪能够有效移除模型冗余，提高模型的普适性，结合轻度早停止技术可以为狂狂检测提供更高效、可靠的解决方案，尤其适用于资源有限的环境。

Abstract: Deep learning models, especially convolutional neural networks (CNNs), have
shown considerable promise for biomedical signals such as EEG-based seizure
detection. However, these models come with challenges, primarily due to their
size and compute requirements in environments where real-time detection or
limited resources are available. In this study, we present a lightweight
one-dimensional CNN model with structured pruning to improve efficiency and
reliability. The model was trained with mild early stopping to address possible
overfitting, achieving an accuracy of 92.78% and a macro-F1 score of 0.8686.
Structured pruning of the baseline CNN involved removing 50% of the
convolutional kernels based on their importance to model predictions.
Surprisingly, after pruning the weights and memory by 50%, the new network was
still able to maintain predictive capabilities, while modestly increasing
precision to 92.87% and improving the macro-F1 score to 0.8707. Overall, we
present a convincing case that structured pruning removes redundancy, improves
generalization, and, in combination with mild early stopping, achieves a
promising way forward to improve seizure detection efficiency and reliability,
which is clear motivation for resource-limited settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代强化学习算法通常假设后继度量具有低秩结构，但本文发现这种假设不成立，需要通过对后继度量进行移位才能获得有效的低秩表示。

Method: 提出移位后继度量的概念，推导Type II Poincaré不等式来量化移位量，建立移位量与系统局部混合特性的联系，并通过实验验证理论发现。

Conclusion: 移位操作能有效改善后继度量的低秩近似，提升目标条件强化学习的性能，为相关算法提供了理论基础和实践指导。

Abstract: Low-rank structure is a common implicit assumption in many modern
reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms. For instance, reward-free and
goal-conditioned RL methods often presume that the successor measure admits a
low-rank representation. In this work, we challenge this assumption by first
remarking that the successor measure itself is not low-rank. Instead, we
demonstrate that a low-rank structure naturally emerges in the shifted
successor measure, which captures the system dynamics after bypassing a few
initial transitions. We provide finite-sample performance guarantees for the
entry-wise estimation of a low-rank approximation of the shifted successor
measure from sampled entries. Our analysis reveals that both the approximation
and estimation errors are primarily governed by the so-called spectral
recoverability of the corresponding matrix. To bound this parameter, we derive
a new class of functional inequalities for Markov chains that we call Type II
Poincar\'e inequalities and from which we can quantify the amount of shift
needed for effective low-rank approximation and estimation. This analysis shows
in particular that the required shift depends on decay of the high-order
singular values of the shifted successor measure and is hence typically small
in practice. Additionally, we establish a connection between the necessary
shift and the local mixing properties of the underlying dynamical system, which
provides a natural way of selecting the shift. Finally, we validate our
theoretical findings with experiments, and demonstrate that shifting the
successor measure indeed leads to improved performance in goal-conditioned RL.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become popular across a diverse set of
tasks in exploring structural relationships between entities. However, due to
the highly connected structure of the datasets, distributed training of GNNs on
large-scale graphs poses significant challenges. Traditional sampling-based
approaches mitigate the computational loads, yet the communication overhead
remains a challenge. This paper presents RapidGNN, a distributed GNN training
framework with deterministic sampling-based scheduling to enable efficient
cache construction and prefetching of remote features. Evaluation on benchmark
graph datasets demonstrates RapidGNN's effectiveness across different scales
and topologies. RapidGNN improves end-to-end training throughput by 2.46x to
3.00x on average over baseline methods across the benchmark datasets, while
cutting remote feature fetches by over 9.70x to 15.39x. RapidGNN further
demonstrates near-linear scalability with an increasing number of computing
units efficiently. Furthermore, it achieves increased energy efficiency over
the baseline methods for both CPU and GPU by 44% and 32%, respectively.

subspace projection to guarantee local updates of each client within
low-dimensional subspaces, thereby reducing communication, computation, and
memory costs. Additionally, it incorporates low-dimensional dual variables to
mitigate client drift. We provide convergence analysis that reveals the impact
of key factors such as step size and subspace projection matrices on
convergence. Experimental results demonstrate its efficiency.

Abstract: We present data driven deep learning models for forecasting and monitoring
amine emissions and key performance parameters in amine-based post-combustion
carbon capture systems. Using operational data from the CESAR1 solvent campaign
at Technology Center Mongstad, four DL architectures such as Basic Long
Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Stacked LSTM, Bi-directional LSTM, and Convolutional
LSTM were developed to capture time-dependent process behavior. For emission
prediction, models were designed for 2-amino-2-methyl-1-propanol (AMP) and
Piperazine emissions measured via FTIR and IMR-MS methods. System performance
models target four critical parameters: CO$_2$ product flow, absorber outlet
temperature, depleted flue gas outlet temperature, and RFCC stripper bottom
temperature. These models achieved high predictive accuracy exceeding 99% and
effectively tracked both steady trends and abrupt fluctuations. Additionally,
we conducted causal impact analysis to evaluate how operational variables
influence emissions and system performance. Eight input variables were
systematically perturbed within $\pm$20% of nominal values to simulate
deviations and assess their impact. This analysis revealed that adjusting
specific operational parameters, such as lean solvent temperature and water
wash conditions, can significantly reduce amine emissions and enhance system
performance. This study highlights ML not only as a predictive tool but also as
a decision support system for optimizing carbon capture operations under steady
state and dynamic conditions. By enabling real time monitoring, scenario
testing, and operational optimization, the developed ML framework offers a
practical pathway for mitigating environmental impacts. This work represents a
step toward intelligent, data-driven control strategies that enhance the
efficiency, stability, and sustainability of carbon capture and storage
technologies.

Conclusion: KAN模型为增强AGC系统网络安全提供了可靠的可解释方法，能够有效检测FDIA攻击并保持高检测精度

Abstract: Automatic Generation Control (AGC) is essential for power grid stability but
remains vulnerable to stealthy cyberattacks, such as False Data Injection
Attacks (FDIAs), which can disturb the system's stability while evading
traditional detection methods. Unlike previous works that relied on blackbox
approaches, this work proposes Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) as an
interpretable and accurate method for FDIA detection in AGC systems,
considering the system nonlinearities. KAN models include a method for
extracting symbolic equations, and are thus able to provide more
interpretability than the majority of machine learning models. The proposed KAN
is trained offline to learn the complex nonlinear relationships between the AGC
measurements under different operating scenarios. After training, symbolic
formulas that describe the trained model's behavior can be extracted and
leveraged, greatly enhancing interpretability. Our findings confirm that the
proposed KAN model achieves FDIA detection rates of up to 95.97% and 95.9% for
the initial model and the symbolic formula, respectively, with a low false
alarm rate, offering a reliable approach to enhancing AGC cybersecurity.

Abstract: The growing computational demands of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) have
raised concerns about the environmental and economic costs of training
large-scale models. While algorithmic efficiency in terms of learning
performance has been extensively studied, the energy requirements, greenhouse
gas emissions, and monetary costs of DRL algorithms remain largely unexplored.
In this work, we present a systematic benchmarking study of the energy
consumption of seven state-of-the-art DRL algorithms, namely DQN, TRPO, A2C,
ARS, PPO, RecurrentPPO, and QR-DQN, implemented using Stable Baselines. Each
algorithm was trained for one million steps each on ten Atari 2600 games, and
power consumption was measured in real-time to estimate total energy usage,
CO2-Equivalent emissions, and electricity cost based on the U.S. national
average electricity price. Our results reveal substantial variation in energy
efficiency and training cost across algorithms, with some achieving comparable
performance while consuming up to 24% less energy (ARS vs. DQN), emitting
nearly 68% less CO2, and incurring almost 68% lower monetary cost (QR-DQN vs.
RecurrentPPO) than less efficient counterparts. We further analyze the
trade-offs between learning performance, training time, energy use, and
financial cost, highlighting cases where algorithmic choices can mitigate
environmental and economic impact without sacrificing learning performance.
This study provides actionable insights for developing energy-aware and
cost-efficient DRL practices and establishes a foundation for incorporating
sustainability considerations into future algorithmic design and evaluation.

Abstract: Mainstream Transformer-based large language models face major efficiency
bottlenecks: training computation scales quadratically with sequence length,
and inference memory grows linearly, limiting long-context processing. Building
large models on non-NVIDIA platforms also poses challenges for stable and
efficient training. To address this, we introduce SpikingBrain, a family of
brain-inspired models designed for efficient long-context training and
inference. SpikingBrain leverages the MetaX GPU cluster and focuses on three
aspects: (1) Model Architecture: linear and hybrid-linear attention
architectures with adaptive spiking neurons; (2) Algorithmic Optimizations: an
efficient, conversion-based training pipeline and a dedicated spike coding
framework; (3) System Engineering: customized training frameworks, operator
libraries, and parallelism strategies tailored to MetaX hardware.
  Using these techniques, we develop two models: SpikingBrain-7B, a linear LLM,
and SpikingBrain-76B, a hybrid-linear MoE LLM. These models demonstrate the
feasibility of large-scale LLM development on non-NVIDIA platforms.
SpikingBrain achieves performance comparable to open-source Transformer
baselines while using only about 150B tokens for continual pre-training. Our
models significantly improve long-sequence training efficiency and deliver
inference with (partially) constant memory and event-driven spiking behavior.
For example, SpikingBrain-7B attains over 100x speedup in Time to First Token
for 4M-token sequences. Training remains stable for weeks on hundreds of MetaX
C550 GPUs, with the 7B model reaching a Model FLOPs Utilization of 23.4
percent. The proposed spiking scheme achieves 69.15 percent sparsity, enabling
low-power operation. Overall, this work demonstrates the potential of
brain-inspired mechanisms to drive the next generation of efficient and

Motivation: 随着深度伪造技术和数字图片伪造的快速增长，确保图片真实性变得越来越养成，需要有效的伪造检测方法

Method: 提出双支卷积神经网络，同时处理空间域和频域特征，通过Siamese网络融合并比较两个分支的特征，生成64维嵌入向量进行分类

Result: 在CASIA 2.0数据集上达到77.9%的准确率，超过传统统计方法，虽然比更大更复杂的检测系统性能较弱，但在计算复杂性和检测可靠性之间取得了平衡

Conclusion: 该方法为数字图片的司法审查提供了强大的方法论，在媒体验证、执法和数字内容可靠性方面推动了视觉司法学的发展

Abstract: With a very rapid increase in deepfakes and digital image forgeries, ensuring
the authenticity of images is becoming increasingly challenging. This report
introduces a forgery detection framework that combines spatial and
frequency-based features for detecting forgeries. We propose a dual branch
convolution neural network that operates on features extracted from spatial and
frequency domains. Features from both branches are fused and compared within a
Siamese network, yielding 64 dimensional embeddings for classification. When
benchmarked on CASIA 2.0 dataset, our method achieves an accuracy of 77.9%,
outperforming traditional statistical methods. Despite its relatively weaker
performance compared to larger, more complex forgery detection pipelines, our
approach balances computational complexity and detection reliability, making it
ready for practical deployment. It provides a strong methodology for forensic
scrutiny of digital images. In a broader sense, it advances the state of the
art in visual forensics, addressing an urgent requirement in media
verification, law enforcement and digital content reliability.

TL;DR: 通过将分布式ADMM与图神经网结合，学习适应性步长和通信权重，提高收敛速度和解质量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ADMM在分布式优化中应用广泛，但存在收敛慢、对超参数敏感等问题，需要提高其效率和稳定性

Method: 将ADMM迭代表示为图神经网消息传递框架，通过展开固定迭代次数进行端到端训练，学习适应性的步长和通信权重

Result: 数值实验证明，学习版本在收敛速度和解决方案质量方面都明显优于标准ADMM

Conclusion: 通过GNN学习ADMM超参数的方法有效提升了算法性能，同时保持了收敛性质，为分布式优化提供了新的解决方案

Abstract: Distributed optimization is fundamental in large-scale machine learning and
control applications. Among existing methods, the Alternating Direction Method
of Multipliers (ADMM) has gained popularity due to its strong convergence
guarantees and suitability for decentralized computation. However, ADMM often
suffers from slow convergence and sensitivity to hyperparameter choices. In
this work, we show that distributed ADMM iterations can be naturally
represented within the message-passing framework of graph neural networks
(GNNs). Building on this connection, we propose to learn adaptive step sizes
and communication weights by a graph neural network that predicts the
hyperparameters based on the iterates. By unrolling ADMM for a fixed number of
iterations, we train the network parameters end-to-end to minimize the final
iterates error for a given problem class, while preserving the algorithm's
convergence properties. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our learned
variant consistently improves convergence speed and solution quality compared
to standard ADMM. The code is available at

TL;DR: 提出基于深度强化学习的个性化效用调优框架DRL-PUT，用于广告推荐系统中的多目标优化，相比人工调优显著提升点击率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统人工调优方法虽然简单可解释，但由于缺乏原则性调优目标、参数组合过多、缺乏个性化和季节性适应能力，往往产生次优结果。

Method: 将问题构建为强化学习任务：根据广告请求状态预测最优超参数以最大化预定义奖励；开发直接从在线服务日志学习最优策略模型的方法，避免估计价值函数。

Result: 在Pinterest广告推荐系统的在线A/B实验中，相比基线人工调优方法，DRL-PUT在处理段上点击率提升9.7%，长点击率提升7.7%。

Conclusion: DRL-PUT框架有效解决了广告推荐系统中的多目标优化问题，通过强化学习方法实现了更好的个性化调优效果。

Abstract: The ranking utility function in an ad recommender system, which linearly
combines predictions of various business goals, plays a central role in
balancing values across the platform, advertisers, and users. Traditional
manual tuning, while offering simplicity and interpretability, often yields
suboptimal results due to its unprincipled tuning objectives, the vast amount
of parameter combinations, and its lack of personalization and adaptability to
seasonality. In this work, we propose a general Deep Reinforcement Learning
framework for Personalized Utility Tuning (DRL-PUT) to address the challenges
of multi-objective optimization within ad recommender systems. Our key
contributions include: 1) Formulating the problem as a reinforcement learning
task: given the state of an ad request, we predict the optimal hyperparameters
to maximize a pre-defined reward. 2) Developing an approach to directly learn
an optimal policy model using online serving logs, avoiding the need to
estimate a value function, which is inherently challenging due to the high
variance and unbalanced distribution of immediate rewards. We evaluated DRL-PUT
through an online A/B experiment in Pinterest's ad recommender system. Compared
to the baseline manual utility tuning approach, DRL-PUT improved the
click-through rate by 9.7% and the long click-through rate by 7.7% on the
treated segment. We conducted a detailed ablation study on the impact of
different reward definitions and analyzed the personalization aspect of the
learned policy model.

*Somtochukwu Azie,Yiping Meng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 大语言模型在建筑项目管理中的伦理决策支持能力存在显著缺陷，需要人类监督


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估LLM在建筑项目管理这个高风险、伦理敏感领域的可靠性和伦理可行性

Method: 混合研究方法：量化测试两个领先LLM在12个真实伦理场景中的表现，质性分析12位行业专家的半结构访谈

Result: LLM在法律遵循等结构化领域表现迅速，但在处理情境细节、确保负责性和提供透明推理方面存在显著缺陷

Conclusion: LLM目前应作为决策支持工具，而非自主伦理决策者，必须强调人类在循环中的监督作用

Abstract: The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into construction project
management (CPM) is accelerating, with Large Language Models (LLMs) emerging as
accessible decision-support tools. This study aims to critically evaluate the
ethical viability and reliability of LLMs when applied to the ethically
sensitive, high-risk decision-making contexts inherent in CPM. A mixed-methods
research design was employed, involving the quantitative performance testing of
two leading LLMs against twelve real-world ethical scenarios using a novel
Ethical Decision Support Assessment Checklist (EDSAC), and qualitative analysis
of semi-structured interviews with 12 industry experts to capture professional
perceptions. The findings reveal that while LLMs demonstrate adequate
performance in structured domains such as legal compliance, they exhibit
significant deficiencies in handling contextual nuance, ensuring
accountability, and providing transparent reasoning. Stakeholders expressed
considerable reservations regarding the autonomous use of AI for ethical
judgments, strongly advocating for robust human-in-the-loop oversight. To our
knowledge, this is one of the first studies to empirically test the ethical
reasoning of LLMs within the construction domain. It introduces the EDSAC
framework as a replicable methodology and provides actionable recommendations,
emphasising that LLMs are currently best positioned as decision-support aids
rather than autonomous ethical agents.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Maestro是一个框架无关的LLM智能体整体优化器，通过联合搜索图结构和节点配置来最大化智能体质量，在多个基准测试中显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有优化器主要调整配置而固定图结构，无法解决结构性故障模式，需要一种能够同时优化图结构和配置的联合优化方法。

Method: 提出Maestro框架，在明确的rollout/token预算约束下，联合搜索图结构和节点配置，并利用轨迹中的反思性文本反馈来优先处理编辑，提高样本效率。

Result: 在IFBench和HotpotQA基准测试中，Maestro平均优于MIPROv2、GEPA和GEPA+Merge分别12%、4.9%和4.86%，即使在仅进行提示优化时也保持领先，且使用比GEPA少得多的rollout次数。

Conclusion: 联合图结构和配置搜索能够解决仅靠提示调优无法解决的结构性故障模式，在多个应用中展现出显著优势。

Abstract: Building reliable LLM agents requires decisions at two levels: the graph
(which modules exist and how information flows) and the configuration of each
node (models, prompts, tools, control knobs). Most existing optimizers tune
configurations while holding the graph fixed, leaving structural failure modes
unaddressed. We introduce Maestro, a framework-agnostic holistic optimizer for
LLM agents that jointly searches over graphs and configurations to maximize
agent quality, subject to explicit rollout/token budgets. Beyond numeric
metrics, Maestro leverages reflective textual feedback from traces to
prioritize edits, improving sample efficiency and targeting specific failure
modes. On the IFBench and HotpotQA benchmarks, Maestro consistently surpasses
leading prompt optimizers--MIPROv2, GEPA, and GEPA+Merge--by an average of 12%,
4.9%, and 4.86%, respectively; even when restricted to prompt-only
optimization, it still leads by 9.65%, 2.37%, and 2.41%. Maestro achieves these
results with far fewer rollouts than GEPA. We further show large gains on two
applications (interviewer & RAG agents), highlighting that joint graph &
configuration search addresses structural failure modes that prompt tuning
alone cannot fix.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一个框架，利用大型语言模型为不同健康利益相关者生成定制化的健康模拟解释，解决现有方法无法满足多样化信息需求的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于代理的建模等仿真方法在健康决策中具有重要价值，但由于模型复杂性导致利益相关者难以使用。现有LLM生成的解释缺乏针对性，无法满足不同利益相关者（临床医生、政策制定者、患者等）的多样化需求。

Method: 采用混合方法设计：首先收集不同健康利益相关者的解释需求和风格偏好，然后通过可控属性调优等技术优化LLM生成定制化输出的能力，最后通过综合指标评估并进一步改进定制化摘要生成。

Result: 论文提出了一个逐步框架来识别利益相关者需求并指导LLM生成定制化的健康模拟解释，但具体实验结果未在摘要中详细说明。

Conclusion: 该研究为解决健康模拟解释的定制化问题提供了一个系统性框架，通过理解利益相关者需求并优化LLM输出，有望提高健康仿真模型的可访问性和实用性。

Abstract: Modeling & Simulation (M&S) approaches such as agent-based models hold
significant potential to support decision-making activities in health, with
recent examples including the adoption of vaccines, and a vast literature on
healthy eating behaviors and physical activity behaviors. These models are
potentially usable by different stakeholder groups, as they support
policy-makers to estimate the consequences of potential interventions and they
can guide individuals in making healthy choices in complex environments.
However, this potential may not be fully realized because of the models'
complexity, which makes them inaccessible to the stakeholders who could benefit
the most. While Large Language Models (LLMs) can translate simulation outputs
and the design of models into text, current approaches typically rely on
one-size-fits-all summaries that fail to reflect the varied informational needs
and stylistic preferences of clinicians, policymakers, patients, caregivers,
and health advocates. This limitation stems from a fundamental gap: we lack a
systematic understanding of what these stakeholders need from explanations and
how to tailor them accordingly. To address this gap, we present a step-by-step
framework to identify stakeholder needs and guide LLMs in generating tailored
explanations of health simulations. Our procedure uses a mixed-methods design
by first eliciting the explanation needs and stylistic preferences of diverse
health stakeholders, then optimizing the ability of LLMs to generate tailored
outputs (e.g., via controllable attribute tuning), and then evaluating through
a comprehensive range of metrics to further improve the tailored generation of
summaries.

Motivation: 传统AI基准测试难以捕捉模型的细微能力，特别是在物理世界建模方面，需要更符合人类认知的评估标准来提升模型行为的可解释性和适用性

Method: 基于Perception Test和OpenEQA基准，通过深度访谈和大规模调查识别关键认知技能（优先级排序、记忆、辨别、情境化），并将研究发现整合到基准设计中

Result: 研究发现参与者认为AI缺乏解释性和共情能力，但对AI性能有很高期望。通过整合人类认知洞察，提出了更符合人类对齐的评估框架

Conclusion: 这项工作强调了以用户为中心的AI评估的重要性，为研究人员和从业者提供了可操作的指南，既能增强当前基准测试实践，也为未来AI模型评估的进步奠定了基础

Abstract: In the rapidly evolving field of artificial intelligence (AI), traditional
benchmarks can fall short in attempting to capture the nuanced capabilities of
AI models. We focus on the case of physical world modeling and propose a novel
approach to augment existing benchmarks with human-derived evaluation criteria,
aiming to enhance the interpretability and applicability of model behaviors.
Grounding our study in the Perception Test and OpenEQA benchmarks, we conducted
in-depth interviews and large-scale surveys to identify key cognitive skills,
such as Prioritization, Memorizing, Discerning, and Contextualizing, that are
critical for both AI and human reasoning. Our findings reveal that participants
perceive AI as lacking in interpretive and empathetic skills yet hold high
expectations for AI performance. By integrating insights from our findings into
benchmark design, we offer a framework for developing more human-aligned means
of defining and measuring progress. This work underscores the importance of
user-centered evaluation in AI development, providing actionable guidelines for
researchers and practitioners aiming to align AI capabilities with human
cognitive processes. Our approach both enhances current benchmarking practices
and sets the stage for future advancements in AI model evaluation.

Conclusion: 通过构建具有显式、语言可配置任务层的环境，可以桥接低级反应式行为和高级战略团队配合，为训练下一代智能满任创建强大且可普适的框架。

Abstract: The convergence of Language models, Agent models, and World models represents
a critical frontier for artificial intelligence. While recent progress has
focused on scaling Language and Agent models, the development of sophisticated,
explicit World Models remains a key bottleneck, particularly for complex,
long-horizon multi-agent tasks. In domains such as robotic soccer, agents
trained via standard reinforcement learning in high-fidelity but
structurally-flat simulators often fail due to intractable exploration spaces
and sparse rewards. This position paper argues that the next frontier in
developing capable agents lies in creating environments that possess an
explicit, hierarchical World Model. We contend that this is best achieved
through hierarchical scaffolding, where complex goals are decomposed into
structured, manageable subgoals. Drawing evidence from a systematic review of
2024 research in multi-agent soccer, we identify a clear and decisive trend
towards integrating symbolic and hierarchical methods with multi-agent
reinforcement learning (MARL). These approaches implicitly or explicitly
construct a task-based world model to guide agent learning. We then propose a
paradigm shift: leveraging Large Language Models to dynamically generate this
hierarchical scaffold, effectively using language to structure the World Model
on the fly. This language-driven world model provides an intrinsic curriculum,
dense and meaningful learning signals, and a framework for compositional
learning, enabling Agent Models to acquire sophisticated, strategic behaviors
with far greater sample efficiency. By building environments with explicit,
language-configurable task layers, we can bridge the gap between low-level
reactive behaviors and high-level strategic team play, creating a powerful and
generalizable framework for training the next generation of intelligent agents.

TL;DR: WiA-LLM是一个新范式，通过整合假设分析(WIA)和强化学习，让大语言模型具备主动思考能力，能够在动态环境中预测未来状态，在王者荣耀游戏中达到74.2%的状态变化预测准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型只能被动处理信息，缺乏系统性探索假设未来的能力，这限制了它们在动态高风险场景（如战略规划、风险评估和实时决策）中的实用性。

Method: 提出WiA-LLM范式，整合假设分析(WIA)方法，通过强化学习利用环境反馈，动态模拟每个潜在行动的结果，使模型能够预测未来状态而非仅仅对当前条件做出反应。

Result: 在王者荣耀复杂多玩家游戏环境中验证，WiA-LLM在预测游戏状态变化方面达到74.2%的准确率（比基线提升高达两倍），在高难度场景中表现尤为突出。

Conclusion: 这是首个正式探索和整合假设分析能力到大语言模型中的工作，代表了LLM主动推理能力的根本性进步，为动态环境中的稳健决策提供了可扩展框架。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at processing information reactively but
lack the ability to systemically explore hypothetical futures. They cannot ask,
"what if we take this action? how will it affect the final outcome" and
forecast its potential consequences before acting. This critical gap limits
their utility in dynamic, high-stakes scenarios like strategic planning, risk
assessment, and real-time decision making. To bridge this gap, we propose
WiA-LLM, a new paradigm that equips LLMs with proactive thinking capabilities.
Our approach integrates What-If Analysis (WIA), a systematic approach for
evaluating hypothetical scenarios by changing input variables. By leveraging
environmental feedback via reinforcement learning, WiA-LLM moves beyond
reactive thinking. It dynamically simulates the outcomes of each potential
action, enabling the model to anticipate future states rather than merely react
to the present conditions. We validate WiA-LLM in Honor of Kings (HoK), a
complex multiplayer game environment characterized by rapid state changes and
intricate interactions. The game's real-time state changes require precise
multi-step consequence prediction, making it an ideal testbed for our approach.
Experimental results demonstrate WiA-LLM achieves a remarkable 74.2% accuracy
in forecasting game-state changes (up to two times gain over baselines). The
model shows particularly significant gains in high-difficulty scenarios where
accurate foresight is critical. To our knowledge, this is the first work to
formally explore and integrate what-if analysis capabilities within LLMs.
WiA-LLM represents a fundamental advance toward proactive reasoning in LLMs,
providing a scalable framework for robust decision-making in dynamic
environments with broad implications for strategic applications.

TL;DR: TalkToAgent是一个基于多智能体LLM的框架，通过五个专门化的LLM代理为RL策略提供交互式自然语言解释，有效弥合了复杂RL策略与领域专家之间的理解鸿沟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前可解释强化学习(XRL)方法存在解释结果可理解性有限、工具覆盖孤立的问题，导致用户不确定使用哪种工具，需要一种能够提供交互式自然语言解释的解决方案。

Method: 提出TalkToAgent多智能体LLM框架，包含五个专门化代理(协调器、解释器、编码器、评估器、调试器)，能够自动将用户查询映射到相关XRL工具，并通过关键状态变量、预期结果或反事实解释来澄清智能体行为。

Result: 在四重水箱过程控制问题上验证，TalkToAgent成功以高准确率将用户查询映射到XRL任务，编码器-调试器交互最小化了反事实生成的失败，定性评估确认其能有效解释智能体行为并在问题领域内情境化其含义。

Conclusion: TalkToAgent框架通过多智能体LLM方法成功解决了XRL领域的可解释性问题，为RL策略提供了交互式自然语言解释能力，显著提升了透明度和用户理解。

Abstract: Explainable Reinforcement Learning (XRL) has emerged as a promising approach
in improving the transparency of Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents. However,
there remains a gap between complex RL policies and domain experts, due to the
limited comprehensibility of XRL results and isolated coverage of current XRL
approaches that leave users uncertain about which tools to employ. To address
these challenges, we introduce TalkToAgent, a multi-agent Large Language Models
(LLM) framework that delivers interactive, natural language explanations for RL
policies. The architecture with five specialized LLM agents (Coordinator,
Explainer, Coder, Evaluator, and Debugger) enables TalkToAgent to automatically
map user queries to relevant XRL tools and clarify an agent's actions in terms
of either key state variables, expected outcomes, or counterfactual
explanations. Moreover, our approach extends previous counterfactual
explanations by deriving alternative scenarios from qualitative behavioral
descriptions, or even new rule-based policies. We validated TalkToAgent on
quadruple-tank process control problem, a well-known nonlinear control
benchmark. Results demonstrated that TalkToAgent successfully mapped user
queries into XRL tasks with high accuracy, and coder-debugger interactions
minimized failures in counterfactual generation. Furthermore, qualitative
evaluation confirmed that TalkToAgent effectively interpreted agent's actions
and contextualized their meaning within the problem domain.

Conclusion: 这是首个系统性地描述语言模型长期合作行为的研究，为未来在更复杂的人机混合社交环境中研究语言模型角色奠定了基础。

Abstract: Language models are increasingly deployed in interactive online environments,
from personal chat assistants to domain-specific agents, raising questions
about their cooperative and competitive behavior in multi-party settings. While
prior work has examined language model decision-making in isolated or
short-term game-theoretic contexts, these studies often neglect long-horizon
interactions, human-model collaboration, and the evolution of behavioral
patterns over time. In this paper, we investigate the dynamics of language
model behavior in the iterated prisoner's dilemma (IPD), a classical framework
for studying cooperation and conflict. We pit model-based agents against a
suite of 240 well-established classical strategies in an Axelrod-style
tournament and find that language models achieve performance on par with, and
in some cases exceeding, the best-known classical strategies. Behavioral
analysis reveals that language models exhibit key properties associated with
strong cooperative strategies - niceness, provocability, and generosity while
also demonstrating rapid adaptability to changes in opponent strategy mid-game.
In controlled "strategy switch" experiments, language models detect and respond
to shifts within only a few rounds, rivaling or surpassing human adaptability.
These results provide the first systematic characterization of long-term
cooperative behaviors in language model agents, offering a foundation for
future research into their role in more complex, mixed human-AI social
environments.

Abstract: Recent advances in language and speech modelling have made it possible to
build autonomous voice assistants that understand and generate human dialogue
in real time. These systems are increasingly being deployed in domains such as
customer service and healthcare care, where they can automate repetitive tasks,
reduce operational costs, and provide constant support around the clock. In
this paper, we present a general methodology for cloning a conversational voice
AI agent from a corpus of call recordings. Although the case study described in
this paper uses telesales data to illustrate the approach, the underlying
process generalizes to any domain where call transcripts are available. Our
system listens to customers over the telephone, responds with a synthetic
voice, and follows a structured playbook learned from top performing human
agents. We describe the domain selection, knowledge extraction, and prompt
engineering used to construct the agent, integrating automatic speech
recognition, a large language model based dialogue manager, and text to speech
synthesis into a streaming inference pipeline. The cloned agent is evaluated
against human agents on a rubric of 22 criteria covering introduction, product
communication, sales drive, objection handling, and closing. Blind tests show
that the AI agent approaches human performance in routine aspects of the call
while underperforming in persuasion and objection handling. We analyze these
shortcomings and refine the prompt accordingly. The paper concludes with design
lessons and avenues for future research, including large scale simulation and
automated evaluation.

Motivation: 解决多智能体系统中专家智能体之间深度协作的语言交互瓶颈问题，现有工作在智能体选择和结果聚合方面有进展，但高效的深度协作仍是一个关键挑战

Method: 引入协作知识模型(CKM)使智能体能够动态感知合作者的认知状态，通过实时认知差距分析自适应调整通信行为（内容焦点、细节层次、表达风格），使用学习策略

Result: 在复杂推理和问题解决基准测试中，OSC显著提高了任务性能和通信效率，将"并行工作的个体"转变为"深度协作的认知团队"

Conclusion: 该框架不仅优化了多智能体协作，还为LLM智能体交互行为提供了新的见解，解决了深度协作的关键瓶颈问题

Abstract: This paper introduces OSC (Orchestrating Cognitive Synergy), a
knowledge-aware adaptive collaboration framework designed to enhance cognitive
synergy in multi-agent systems with large language models. While prior work has
advanced agent selection and result aggregation, efficient linguistic
interactions for deep collaboration among expert agents remain a critical
bottleneck. OSC addresses this gap as a pivotal intermediate layer between
selection and aggregation, introducing Collaborator Knowledge Models (CKM) to
enable each agent to dynamically perceive its collaborators' cognitive states.
Through real-time cognitive gap analysis, agents adaptively adjust
communication behaviors, including content focus, detail level, and expression
style, using learned strategies. Experiments on complex reasoning and
problem-solving benchmarks demonstrate that OSC significantly improves task
performance and communication efficiency, transforming "parallel-working
individuals'' into a "deeply collaborative cognitive team.'' This framework not
only optimizes multi-agent collaboration but also offers new insights into LLM
agent interaction behaviors.

TL;DR: SparkUI-Parser是一个新颖的端到端GUI解析框架，通过连续坐标建模和拒绝机制，显著提高了定位精度和推理速度，同时支持对整个界面的细粒度解析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态大语言模型在GUI感知中存在两个主要问题：1）基于文本自回归机制的离散坐标建模导致定位精度低和推理速度慢；2）只能定位预定义元素集合，无法解析整个界面，限制了广泛应用和下游任务支持。

Method: 提出基于预训练MLLM的连续坐标建模方法，增加token路由器和坐标解码器，避免了离散输出特性和逐token生成过程的限制。引入基于改进匈牙利匹配算法的拒绝机制来识别和拒绝不存在的元素，减少误报。

Result: 在ScreenSpot、ScreenSpot-v2、CAGUI-Grounding和ScreenParse等多个基准测试中，该方法始终优于最先进的SOTA方法。

Conclusion: SparkUI-Parser通过连续建模和拒绝机制，成功解决了现有GUI解析方法的局限性，在精度和速度方面都有显著提升，为下游任务提供了更好的支持。

Abstract: The existing Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for GUI perception have
made great progress. However, the following challenges still exist in prior
methods: 1) They model discrete coordinates based on text autoregressive
mechanism, which results in lower grounding accuracy and slower inference
speed. 2) They can only locate predefined sets of elements and are not capable
of parsing the entire interface, which hampers the broad application and
support for downstream tasks. To address the above issues, we propose
SparkUI-Parser, a novel end-to-end framework where higher localization
precision and fine-grained parsing capability of the entire interface are
simultaneously achieved. Specifically, instead of using probability-based
discrete modeling, we perform continuous modeling of coordinates based on a
pre-trained Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) with an additional token
router and coordinate decoder. This effectively mitigates the limitations
inherent in the discrete output characteristics and the token-by-token
generation process of MLLMs, consequently boosting both the accuracy and the
inference speed. To further enhance robustness, a rejection mechanism based on
a modified Hungarian matching algorithm is introduced, which empowers the model
to identify and reject non-existent elements, thereby reducing false positives.
Moreover, we present ScreenParse, a rigorously constructed benchmark to
systematically assess structural perception capabilities of GUI models across
diverse scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach
consistently outperforms SOTA methods on ScreenSpot, ScreenSpot-v2,
CAGUI-Grounding and ScreenParse benchmarks. The resources are available at

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出基于本体的方法，通过语言学描述符将定性对话特征量化为可计算的定义，并应用于LLM的熟练度控制，提高对话AI的可控性和透明度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型语言模型作为对话代理时的可控性挑战，特别是确保可预测和用户个性化的响应，需要将定性对话特征转化为可形式化定义和推理的定量表示。

Method: 使用语言学描述符将定性概念量化为可计算定义，在描述逻辑中形式化这些定义并构建本体，通过微调指导LLM的受控文本生成。

Result: 实验结果表明该方法能够提供一致且可解释的熟练度定义，改善了对话AI的透明度。

Conclusion: 基于本体的方法能够有效实现LLM对话的可控性，为定性对话特征的定量化和形式化推理提供了可行方案。

Abstract: The controllability of Large Language Models (LLMs) when used as
conversational agents is a key challenge, particularly to ensure predictable
and user-personalized responses. This work proposes an ontology-based approach
to formally define conversational features that are typically qualitative in
nature. By leveraging a set of linguistic descriptors, we derive quantitative
definitions for qualitatively-defined concepts, enabling their integration into
an ontology for reasoning and consistency checking. We apply this framework to
the task of proficiency-level control in conversations, using CEFR language
proficiency levels as a case study. These definitions are then formalized in
description logic and incorporated into an ontology, which guides controlled
text generation of an LLM through fine-tuning. Experimental results demonstrate
that our approach provides consistent and explainable proficiency-level
definitions, improving transparency in conversational AI.

TL;DR: DOVIS协议和AgentRank-UC算法为构建可信的智能体网络提供解决方案，通过隐私保护的性能数据收集和动态排名机制实现智能体生态系统的可扩展管理


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI智能体技术的发展，需要建立机器原生生态系统（Web of Agents），但缺乏全局透明的交互网络和性能评估机制，使得智能体排名难以实现

Method: 提出五层DOVIS协议（发现、编排、验证、激励、语义）收集隐私保护的性能数据，并开发AgentRank-UC算法结合使用频率和能力指标进行动态排名

Result: 通过仿真实验验证了算法的收敛性、鲁棒性和抗Sybil攻击能力，证明了协调协议和性能感知排名的可行性

Conclusion: DOVIS协议和AgentRank-UC算法为实现可扩展、可信的智能体网络提供了可行的技术方案，为Web of Agents生态系统的构建奠定了基础

Abstract: AI agents -- powered by reasoning-capable large language models (LLMs) and
integrated with tools, data, and web search -- are poised to transform the
internet into a \emph{Web of Agents}: a machine-native ecosystem where
autonomous agents interact, collaborate, and execute tasks at scale. Realizing
this vision requires \emph{Agent Ranking} -- selecting agents not only by
declared capabilities but by proven, recent performance. Unlike Web~1.0's
PageRank, a global, transparent network of agent interactions does not exist;
usage signals are fragmented and private, making ranking infeasible without
coordination.
  We propose \textbf{DOVIS}, a five-layer operational protocol
(\emph{Discovery, Orchestration, Verification, Incentives, Semantics}) that
enables the collection of minimal, privacy-preserving aggregates of usage and
performance across the ecosystem. On this substrate, we implement
\textbf{AgentRank-UC}, a dynamic, trust-aware algorithm that combines
\emph{usage} (selection frequency) and \emph{competence} (outcome quality,
cost, safety, latency) into a unified ranking. We present simulation results
and theoretical guarantees on convergence, robustness, and Sybil resistance,
demonstrating the viability of coordinated protocols and performance-aware
ranking in enabling a scalable, trustworthy Agentic Web.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Sticker-TTS是一个新颖的测试时扩展框架，通过协调三个协作的大型推理模型，利用历史经验进行迭代探索和精化解决方案，显著提高了计算效率和推理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前测试时扩展方法主要依赖冗余采样，忽视了历史经验的利用，限制了计算效率。需要一种能够有效利用历史尝试来指导推理过程的方法。

Method: 提出Sticker-TTS框架，使用三个协作的大型推理模型，通过提取、精化和重用关键信息（称为stickers）来进行多轮推理。采用两阶段优化策略，结合模仿学习和自我改进实现渐进式精化。

Result: 在三个具有挑战性的数学推理基准测试（AIME-24、AIME-25和OlymMATH）上，Sticker-TTS在可比较的推理预算下 consistently超越了强基线方法，包括自一致性和先进的强化学习方法。

Conclusion: Sticker-TTS通过sticker引导的历史经验利用，有效提高了大型推理模型的性能和计算效率，证明了历史经验在测试时扩展中的重要性。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have exhibited strong performance on complex
reasoning tasks, with further gains achievable through increased computational
budgets at inference. However, current test-time scaling methods predominantly
rely on redundant sampling, ignoring the historical experience utilization,
thereby limiting computational efficiency. To overcome this limitation, we
propose Sticker-TTS, a novel test-time scaling framework that coordinates three
collaborative LRMs to iteratively explore and refine solutions guided by
historical attempts. At the core of our framework are distilled key
conditions-termed stickers-which drive the extraction, refinement, and reuse of
critical information across multiple rounds of reasoning. To further enhance
the efficiency and performance of our framework, we introduce a two-stage
optimization strategy that combines imitation learning with self-improvement,
enabling progressive refinement. Extensive evaluations on three challenging
mathematical reasoning benchmarks, including AIME-24, AIME-25, and OlymMATH,
demonstrate that Sticker-TTS consistently surpasses strong baselines, including
self-consistency and advanced reinforcement learning approaches, under
comparable inference budgets. These results highlight the effectiveness of
sticker-guided historical experience utilization. Our code and data are
available at https://github.com/RUCAIBox/Sticker-TTS.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ProToM是一个基于心理理论的AI系统，通过贝叶斯逆规划推断智能体目标，提供针对性的上下文敏感反馈来促进多智能体系统中的亲社会行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类虽然是社会性生物，但在追求独立目标时难以判断何时以及如何协助他人，这会阻碍合作。因此需要开发能够提供有用反馈来促进亲社会行为的AI系统。

Method: ProToM首先使用贝叶斯逆规划推断智能体目标，然后基于推断的目标分布，通过最大化期望效用来选择要传达的反馈信息。

Result: 在Doors、Keys、Gems和Overcooked两个多智能体环境中，ProToM相比基线方法实现了更高的成功率、更短的任务完成时间，并且获得人类用户的一致偏好。

Conclusion: 当前最先进的大语言和推理模型在提供既上下文相关又时机恰当的反馈方面存在不足，而ProToM能够提供有针对性和有用的反馈，有效促进多智能体合作。

Abstract: While humans are inherently social creatures, the challenge of identifying
when and how to assist and collaborate with others - particularly when pursuing
independent goals - can hinder cooperation. To address this challenge, we aim
to develop an AI system that provides useful feedback to promote prosocial
behaviour - actions that benefit others, even when not directly aligned with
one's own goals. We introduce ProToM, a Theory of Mind-informed facilitator
that promotes prosocial actions in multi-agent systems by providing targeted,
context-sensitive feedback to individual agents. ProToM first infers agents'
goals using Bayesian inverse planning, then selects feedback to communicate by
maximising expected utility, conditioned on the inferred goal distribution. We
evaluate our approach against baselines in two multi-agent environments: Doors,
Keys, and Gems, as well as Overcooked. Our results suggest that
state-of-the-art large language and reasoning models fall short of
communicating feedback that is both contextually grounded and well-timed -
leading to higher communication overhead and task speedup. In contrast, ProToM
provides targeted and helpful feedback, achieving a higher success rate,
shorter task completion times, and is consistently preferred by human users.

Motivation: ODRL已成为数字资源访问和使用管理的实际标准，但缺乏全面的正式语义学定义

Method: 基于查询答处的方法提出简洁直观的正式语义学，精炼之前的形式化工作，并与ODRL 2.2规范保持一致

Result: 建立了一套完整的ODRL评估语义学，并在此基础上定义了政策比较问题

Conclusion: 该研究为ODRL提供了坚实的理论基础，特别是在数据共享场景中对于政策评估和比较具有重要价值

Abstract: We consider the problem of evaluating, and comparing computational policies
in the Open Digital Rights Language (ODRL), which has become the de facto
standard for governing the access and usage of digital resources. Although
preliminary progress has been made on the formal specification of the
language's features, a comprehensive formal semantics of ODRL is still missing.
In this paper, we provide a simple and intuitive formal semantics for ODRL that
is based on query answering. Our semantics refines previous formalisations, and
is aligned with the latest published specification of the language (2.2).
Building on our evaluation semantics, and motivated by data sharing scenarios,
we also define and study the problem of comparing two policies, detecting
equivalent, more restrictive or more permissive policies.

Conclusion: LatticeWorld提供了一个简单有效的3D世界生成框架，成功将大语言模型与工业级渲染引擎结合，为3D环境生产流程带来了革命性的效率提升。

Abstract: Recent research has been increasingly focusing on developing 3D world models
that simulate complex real-world scenarios. World models have found broad
applications across various domains, including embodied AI, autonomous driving,
entertainment, etc. A more realistic simulation with accurate physics will
effectively narrow the sim-to-real gap and allow us to gather rich information
about the real world conveniently. While traditional manual modeling has
enabled the creation of virtual 3D scenes, modern approaches have leveraged
advanced machine learning algorithms for 3D world generation, with most recent
advances focusing on generative methods that can create virtual worlds based on
user instructions. This work explores such a research direction by proposing
LatticeWorld, a simple yet effective 3D world generation framework that
streamlines the industrial production pipeline of 3D environments. LatticeWorld
leverages lightweight LLMs (LLaMA-2-7B) alongside the industry-grade rendering
engine (e.g., Unreal Engine 5) to generate a dynamic environment. Our proposed
framework accepts textual descriptions and visual instructions as multimodal
inputs and creates large-scale 3D interactive worlds with dynamic agents,
featuring competitive multi-agent interaction, high-fidelity physics
simulation, and real-time rendering. We conduct comprehensive experiments to
evaluate LatticeWorld, showing that it achieves superior accuracy in scene
layout generation and visual fidelity. Moreover, LatticeWorld achieves over a
$90\times$ increase in industrial production efficiency while maintaining high
creative quality compared with traditional manual production methods. Our demo

TL;DR: REMOTE是一个统一的多模态关系抽取框架，通过多级最优传输和专家混合机制，能够同时提取文本实体和视觉对象之间的模态内和模态间关系，解决了现有方法只能提取单一类型关系三元组的限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态关系抽取方法通常只能提取单一类型的关系三元组，无法处理超出指定类型的三元组。直接组合这些方法无法捕捉动态的跨模态交互，并带来显著的计算冗余。

Method: 提出REMOTE框架：1）使用专家混合机制动态选择不同关系三元组类型的最优交互特征；2）采用多级最优传输融合模块保留低层特征，同时保持多层编码，获得更具表现力的表示；3）创建统一多模态关系抽取数据集(UMRE)进行评估。

Result: 大量实验表明，REMOTE能够有效提取各种类型的关系三元组，在两个公共MRE数据集上几乎所有指标都达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: REMOTE框架通过统一的架构解决了多模态关系抽取中的类型限制问题，通过动态特征选择和特征保留机制显著提升了性能，为多模态知识图谱构建提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal relation extraction (MRE) is a crucial task in the fields of
Knowledge Graph and Multimedia, playing a pivotal role in multimodal knowledge
graph construction. However, existing methods are typically limited to
extracting a single type of relational triplet, which restricts their ability
to extract triplets beyond the specified types. Directly combining these
methods fails to capture dynamic cross-modal interactions and introduces
significant computational redundancy. Therefore, we propose a novel
\textit{unified multimodal Relation Extraction framework with Multilevel
Optimal Transport and mixture-of-Experts}, termed REMOTE, which can
simultaneously extract intra-modal and inter-modal relations between textual
entities and visual objects. To dynamically select optimal interaction features
for different types of relational triplets, we introduce mixture-of-experts
mechanism, ensuring the most relevant modality information is utilized.
Additionally, considering that the inherent property of multilayer sequential
encoding in existing encoders often leads to the loss of low-level information,
we adopt a multilevel optimal transport fusion module to preserve low-level
features while maintaining multilayer encoding, yielding more expressive
representations. Correspondingly, we also create a Unified Multimodal Relation
Extraction (UMRE) dataset to evaluate the effectiveness of our framework,
encompassing diverse cases where the head and tail entities can originate from
either text or image. Extensive experiments show that REMOTE effectively
extracts various types of relational triplets and achieves state-of-the-art
performanc on almost all metrics across two other public MRE datasets. We
release our resources at https://github.com/Nikol-coder/REMOTE.

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of jointly modeling user intent diversity
and behavioral uncertainty in recommender systems. A unified representation
learning framework is proposed. The framework builds a multi-intent
representation module and an uncertainty modeling mechanism. It extracts
multi-granularity interest structures from user behavior sequences. Behavioral
ambiguity and preference fluctuation are captured using Bayesian distribution
modeling. In the multi-intent modeling part, the model introduces multiple
latent intent vectors. These vectors are weighted and fused using an attention
mechanism to generate semantically rich representations of long-term user
preferences. In the uncertainty modeling part, the model learns the mean and
covariance of behavior representations through Gaussian distributions. This
reflects the user's confidence in different behavioral contexts. Next, a
learnable fusion strategy is used to combine long-term intent and short-term
behavior signals. This produces the final user representation, improving both
recommendation accuracy and robustness. The method is evaluated on standard
public datasets. Experimental results show that it outperforms existing
representative models across multiple metrics. It also demonstrates greater
stability and adaptability under cold-start and behavioral disturbance
scenarios. The approach alleviates modeling bottlenecks faced by traditional
methods when dealing with complex user behavior. These findings confirm the
effectiveness and practical value of the unified modeling strategy in
real-world recommendation tasks.

Abstract: With the rapid expansion of user bases on short video platforms, personalized
recommendation systems are playing an increasingly critical role in enhancing
user experience and optimizing content distribution. Traditional interest
modeling methods often rely on unimodal data, such as click logs or text
labels, which limits their ability to fully capture user preferences in a
complex multimodal content environment. To address this challenge, this paper
proposes a multimodal foundation model-based framework for user interest
modeling and behavior analysis. By integrating video frames, textual
descriptions, and background music into a unified semantic space using
cross-modal alignment strategies, the framework constructs fine-grained user
interest vectors. Additionally, we introduce a behavior-driven feature
embedding mechanism that incorporates viewing, liking, and commenting sequences
to model dynamic interest evolution, thereby improving both the timeliness and
accuracy of recommendations. In the experimental phase, we conduct extensive
evaluations using both public and proprietary short video datasets, comparing
our approach against multiple mainstream recommendation algorithms and modeling
techniques. Results demonstrate significant improvements in behavior prediction
accuracy, interest modeling for cold-start users, and recommendation
click-through rates. Moreover, we incorporate interpretability mechanisms using
attention weights and feature visualization to reveal the model's decision
basis under multimodal inputs and trace interest shifts, thereby enhancing the
transparency and controllability of the recommendation system.

Motivation: 基础RAG在处理法律和监管领域的复杂QA任务时遇到困难，top-k策略容易漏掉关键信息块，导致答案不完整或不准确

Method: 1. One-SHOT检索方法：根据令牌预算适配选择信息块，在模型上下文窗口内包含尽可能多的相关内容，并设计模块进一步筛选和精炼块
2. 迭代检索策略：基于推理代理RAG框架，通过推理LLM动态发送搜索查询、评估检索结果并在多轮中渐进地精炼上下文

Result: 通过在政府文档数据集上的广泛实验，为法律和监管领域的实际应用提供了实用的见解和指导

Conclusion: 设计的两种策略有效解决了查询偏移和检索懒散问题，显著提升了RAG在复杂法律政府文档QA任务中的性能

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) based on Large Language Models (LLMs) is
a powerful solution to understand and query the industry's closed-source
documents. However, basic RAG often struggles with complex QA tasks in legal
and regulatory domains, particularly when dealing with numerous government
documents. The top-$k$ strategy frequently misses golden chunks, leading to
incomplete or inaccurate answers. To address these retrieval bottlenecks, we
explore two strategies to improve evidence coverage and answer quality. The
first is a One-SHOT retrieval method that adaptively selects chunks based on a
token budget, allowing as much relevant content as possible to be included
within the model's context window. Additionally, we design modules to further
filter and refine the chunks. The second is an iterative retrieval strategy
built on a Reasoning Agentic RAG framework, where a reasoning LLM dynamically
issues search queries, evaluates retrieved results, and progressively refines
the context over multiple turns. We identify query drift and retrieval laziness
issues and further design two modules to tackle them. Through extensive
experiments on a dataset of government documents, we aim to offer practical
insights and guidance for real-world applications in legal and regulatory
domains.

Result: 在多个公共数据集上的实验结果表明，该模型优于现有基线方法，特别是在小规模数据集上表现突出

Conclusion: 通过结合两种矩阵分解技术的混合方法能够更有效地获取全局协同信息，提升推荐系统的性能

Abstract: In recent years, methods that combine contrastive learning with graph neural
networks have emerged to address the challenges of recommendation systems,
demonstrating powerful performance and playing a significant role in this
domain. Contrastive learning primarily tackles the issue of data sparsity by
employing data augmentation strategies, effectively alleviating this problem
and showing promising results. Although existing research has achieved
favorable outcomes, most current graph contrastive learning methods are based
on two types of data augmentation strategies: the first involves perturbing the
graph structure, such as by randomly adding or removing edges; and the second
applies clustering techniques. We believe that the interactive information
obtained through these two strategies does not fully capture the user-item
interactions. In this paper, we propose a novel method called HMFGCL (Hybrid
Matrix Factorization Based Graph Contrastive Learning), which integrates two
distinct matrix factorization techniques-low-rank matrix factorization (MF) and
singular value decomposition (SVD)-to complementarily acquire global
collaborative information, thereby constructing enhanced views. Experimental
results on multiple public datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms
existing baselines, particularly on small-scale datasets.
